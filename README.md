# Hotel Reviews Sentiment Analysis
Mining Web Data for Business Insights

How to replicate this analysis:

1. You should either have Mini-forge or Anaconda; a conda working environment installed on your device.
2. If a conda environment doesn't exist, you can install **miniforge** [HERE](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge](https://kirenz.github.io/codelabs/codelabs/miniforge-setup/#0)https://kirenz.github.io/codelabs/codelabs/miniforge-setup/#0)

I highly recommend using miniforge instead of anaconda. Miniforge is a small, bootstrap version of the data science platform Anaconda (like Minconda) that includes only Python.

Using your IDE, pull this repository using:
