Date of stay: May 2023,woz72,5 STAR EXCELLENCE  AND CONVENIENCE ,"Arriving into Changi in the morning after a 13 hr flight from London , the convenience of this hotels proximity to the airport was greatly appreciated .
A short walk from the terminal and you find yourself in the 5 star luxury of the Crowne Plaza Hotel .
We had a one night stopover in Singapore with a following morning flight back to Perth and decided this hotel was a good option , cutting out taxis etc to and from the city for such a short stay .
We had two interconnecting rooms booked for a family of 4 including 2 x kids in the Jewel wing of the hotel .
As we arrived into Singapore early morning the hotel offered early check in to one of our rooms for an additional fee , this was pre arranged prior to our arrival .
Unlike most other hotels this was not the total cost of another nights stay for the previous night in order to guarantee the early check in , it worked out roughly just under 50% of another nights stay but was well worth it particularly when the hotel gave us access to both rooms immediately on arrival in the morning .
The rooms were very high standard, extremely spacious and truely 5 star offering panoramic views from the bathroom onto the connecting walkway from Changi to the Jewel shopping Mall and one of Changi's runways .
The bathrooms were large and very well furbished , complete with a free standing bath , electric black out blinds and glass touch dimmer switch for additional privacy .
Once again , no expense spared and 100% FIVE STAR .
After a few hours sleep we ventured to the adjoining Jewel Shopping Mall complete with its own full size waterfall .
As you would expect , this is most impressive and another example of all the exciting sights to see in Singapore and remarkable feats of engineering on offer in this City State .
Plenty of dinning options here and of course shopping , there is even waterfall light shows in the evening however I did notice that compared to the malls in downtown Singapore the prices in a lot of the restaurants are significantly higher .

Getting back to the hotel, we spent sometime by the very impressive swimming pool .
Large and very well designed with plenty of sunbathing areas , like everything else about this hotel the layout and quality is most impressive .
We ventured into the mall at night to eat after first visiting the hotels "" BAR 75 "", this is a stylish sports themed bar which offers a very generous happy hour .
In hind sight we wish now we had stayed and dined in the hotel restaurant called Azur which I believe offers something in the margin of around 30% discount to hotel guests .
Overall , this was a great way to end our trip , the hotel offers both convenience and luxury and we would definitely stay here again .",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Perth, Australia",74 ,90 ,,
Date of stay: September 2023,Connector00620128229,Wedding Banquet on 23/9,"We wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the outstanding service we received during our recent stay at Crowne Plaza for our wedding on 23 September. Specifically, I'd like to commend guest relations Raymond for going the extra mile to give us a pleasant experience!

From the moment we arrived, Raymond welcomed us with his friendly disposition and he truly went the extra mile in satisfying our requirements. As a result, we were not only provided with a spacious and beautiful room but also had a view none like others. Our family was very pleased too.

We were pleasantly surprised by Raymond's thoughtful gesture of sending us a pair of groom and bride bears, tasteful appetizers, wine and a beautiful cake. These really made our wedding day even more memorable and left us feeling really touched.

Throughout our stay, Raymond's dedication to ensuring our stay was pleasant and enjoyable did not go unnoticed, and we are truly grateful for his exceptional service.

Though the wedding had hiccups somehow but we still enjoyed the stay thanks to large part of Raymond's professionalism, hospitality, and commitment to making our experience unforgettable. It's rare to encounter such exceptional service, and we are immensely thankful for the efforts put up by the guest relations team.

Thank you once again for making our special day even more special! :)",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,1 ,,,4.0

This stay was disappointing, given the great experiences during previous stays. Our check in experience wasn‚Äôt great. It was slow and shortly after checking in I noticed I had been charged twice for our stay. I returned to reception and waited and the receptionist advised that it could take up to 10 days for the refund to be processed. Appreciate this is a bank issue, but there was no apology for the double charge and no explanation. The rooms in the original building are fine but they are getting a bit tired and for the price, they should be much better. The food wasn‚Äôt great and the service in the restaurant was poor. It felt like the staff were bored and tired. On checking out, we had to wait so we were directed to the self- check out.

If the timing is right then a visit to the pool is a must, after a flight being able to sort your muscles by swimming is perfect.  The cream on the cake for me is great bedding, lovely pillows and a room that is not overwhelmed by blue light and out door light and noice.

This room on both occasions was booked for a layover, so we had paid for this room for 8 hours only on each stay. You book these rooms to sleep as you are tired. I was annoyed that if i wanted the toiletries I had to call them and they would deliver. I did not do that, I just opened my luggage and retrieved my own. Which i would have preferred not to do, just an inconvenience.
We rebooked this hotel on the way home, for the exact same reason and for the exact same time, 8 hours.

They upgraded me when I arrived extremely angry and sweaty which was nice and helped blow off the steam but to be honest I also stayed at the FOUR SEASONS and the price difference is so small that its really really not worth it.  Singapore is small and you do feel the difference when you arrive at a 5 star hotel.  The highlight was the bed which was great but strangely enough I stayed in two separate occasions (1st day of the trip and last day of the trip) and the second time around the BED WAS NOT THE SAME!!

Firstly we could immediately smell stale  smoke in our room despite all rooms supposedly being non- smoking. Secondly as we had a very early flight next morning we wanted a quick early bite to eat as soon as the Azur restaurant opened. We went down from our room at 6.10pm . Despite the fact that the restaurant has a 6pm opening it was clear they were totally unprepared and indeed it took time to be seated . once we were shown to a table the attendant immediately asked if we had our iphones to place the order.

Date of stay: February 2023,edinburghsurfer,Incredible Overnight Stay In Amazing Hotel,"Stayed here for one night during a brief layover. Upon arriving at the reception after a long-haul flight and feeling rather tired, the reception team could not have been kinder or more accommodating. I was immediately made to feel welcome, with all information and procedures being done quickly and efficiently. One thing I noted upon arrival was how clean the hotel is, which certainly is a true reflection on the pride the staff show towards their work.

I was put in a Double Room in the Jewel Wing, which is connected to the main building via an abstract tunnel, only a couple of minutes walk from the reception. Again, the building was spotlessly clean, and rather quiet. The room itself was exactly as advertised, with a huge double bed and small sitting area being the focal point of the room. A large flat screen TV is fixed to the wall, with a good selection of international programming and some movies. A small minibar fridge is available to store items, which was a nice touch. The bathroom is stunning, with a large free-standing bath and a rainfall shower for your use. The toiletries were notably of a high standard, and the towels offered were a step up from more 'budget' hotels. My only issue was operating the blackout blind in the bathroom, however I feel this was perhaps user error rather than a design or maintenance flaw.

I did not dine at the hotel, nor did I have time to use the swimming pool or gym facilities, however having walked through these areas, I can see that they are very well maintained and certainly of a high standard.",,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",61 ,5 ,5.0,

We couldn't face going into central Singapore with the heat after a long night's flight - and we didn't have complimentary lounge access.
The transit hotel at T3 had limited availability due to renovations; the pay-per-use lounge in T3 looked awful - plus both are expensive.
So we looked at hotels. Crowne Plaza was a good option, even though it required us to exit/re-enter immigration.
When we arrived reception told us the rate we'd been quoted by central booking was incorrect (it should have been higher). Nevertheless, after some discussion, they honoured the original rate - which we appreciated.
We'd booked the smallest/cheapest room avaiable, but we thought it was very good. The bathroom was separated by sliding glass doors - but it was frosted glass with soundproofing, so privacy not a problem.
The bed was king-size, firm with great linen - we had a long sleep and a few showers. There was also wifi.

It was a really unpleasant experience speaking to Jill from the Reservation Team. She was monotonous, dull and does not sound a single bit of welcoming. I think a robot would have done a better job. I hope the team can kindly look into the improvement and probably see how other hotels like Ritz Carlton are handling such calls. I would have given a 5-star if not for her.

Date of stay: November 2020,Serene K,Commendable service,"Our family of 3 checked in on 22 November 2020 for a 1 night staycation and already regretted why we did not make plans to stay an extra night for this staycation.

The Safe Management Measures were in place at the hotel and that probably caused delays during check-in. Probably due to the local school holiday, the hotel was busy and we didn't manage to get our room when we arrive just before 1pm, though the lady who called me to confirm our reservation a day earlier told me we are able to check in at 1pm.
No complaints, we understand they were trying their best. We went for lunch and came back slightly past 3pm and our room was ready, with a complimentary upgrade to a premier room. That was a nice touch from the hotel! We were a little apprehensive when we received the keycard (Room 444) but the front office personnel who checked us in immediately noticed my husband's discomfort and asked if we were okay with the room number, otherwise he would try to get us another room. Figuring that we might have to wait because they were quite full, we decided to stick to that room since it was only for 1 night. We were ushered very professionally and in a friendly manner to the lift, all the while being reminded to let them know if we find the room's cleaniness not to standard etc.

The room was great! No issue with the inauspicious room number. Haha! Spacious, bright, comfortable. No complaints!

Hotel was located very strategically in T3 of Changi Airport and there was endless activities for my kid to enjoy and great food all around. Jewel was just 5 min walk with really easy access via a link bridge just 1 level above the hotel.

What was really worth mentioning was the warm hospitality and excellent service we experienced from the team at the hotel. The awesome service was consistent from the guy checking safe entry at the entrance to the room attendants who passed us at the corridors. Even the room service guy we called in the middle of the night for a bucket of ice delivered the ice bucket with a huge smile!

We couldn't ask for a more enjoyable experience than what we had!

Looking forward to our next stay with Crowne Plaza Changi Airport. Till then, please continue to delight your guests by being so awesome, the way you guys are!

Thanks again for a great break!

Date of stay: November 2020,Clemens C,Birthday staycation,"We booked a King Bed Club Room for both our birthdays and everything was excellent from start to finish. From the check-in with Miss Grazel at the Front Desk, to spotless housekeeping by Ruth's housekeeping team, until the check-out by Mustafa, the service standards were impeccable. The tub in the room was also a bonus addition.

As the hotel was situated next door to Jewel, a shopping paradise is conveniently located nearby. We were able to purchase drinks and light bites from the airport supermarket for the evenings, and the hotel was able to provide glasses and plates to your doorstep. Breakfast was cook-to-order via an online menu.

In addition, we were provided a cake for the birthday which was tasty, and a memorable souvenir as well. The club room booking also meant that we had complimentary cocktails and canap√©s every evening from 6-8pm. A three-tier food tray was served (menu rotated every day), with other complimentary alcoholic drinks on the menu (non-alcoholic available).

Mustafa, upon check-out, was also able to hold our suitcases and keep our cake in a fridge, while we spent some time at Jewel. Overall, a fantastic stay for a domestic vacation. Beware that the school holiday season has started though!",,,15 ,7 ,5.0,

The reservation during booking process says nothing about a crew rate and online via various portals the price is cheaper than the alleged crew rate that nobody has reserved. After 5 attempts to call, the manager called back who could not or did not want to solve the problem.  After 17 years IHG the first hotel to refuse to credit points. Breakfast was already paid for but didn't come. You have to order it again, but you can't find any information about it. Hotel inadequate in terms of room standard and communication.

Used the swimming pool and it was not crowded. Breakfast was not up to the mark as variety was lacking. Especially for young kids.  The major issue was when checking out.

The pool is also nice.   Breakfast was lacklustre. Fairly simple choices and bland food, in retrospect not worth the additional cost, especially since we were heading to a lounge at the airport.

The booking experience somehow already marred my impression of the 5 star Hotel. Thank goodness the check in process was fast and reception was knowledgeable about the promotion.

The best staff that impressed me the most was Chef Herman who was manning the egg counter. He is jovial and greeted any guest who walked past him.

In terms of amenities, room is spacious but poorly equipped with an uncovered wardrobe and a small TV. Other than coffee and tea sachets, we were greeted by empty fridge that allows us to place in anything we wanted.

Bathroom was also spacious and comfortable.

Swimming pool was nice with different depths suitable for both kids and adults.

Overall for the $303 package that comes with breakfast for 2 (s$50), 3 tickets to Canopy Park (s$12) and per entry carpark (s$58), not much of a promotion in my opinion as a search via booking websites reveal just about 10% difference with room, breakfast and parking.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,2 ,2 ,,3.0

At first with our luggage it seemed to take forever to get to the room but once we were inside the room and saw the view of The Jewel all was forgotten.   The room was quite spacious and well thought out with plenty of room for our 2 suitcases.   There were enough charging outlets to fit all our appliances which we appreciated after using them for the 8 hour flight we had just arrived on.   The shower had plenty of pressure and we were able to wash off the travelling feeling.   We were able to stretch our muscles and walk to Jewel for dinner.

This hotel is situated at the end of Terminal 3 and is adjacent to the new Jewel Shopping complex.  However to get to this hotel you will need to exit the terminal and go through Immigration. This is not a problem as the immigration process at Changi is so efficient that within a few minutes you are out and on your way. The hotel is no more than a 10 minutes walk from the baggage carousel exit. Being connected to the terminal means you also have access to all manner of transportation into the City.

We highly recommend our wedding coordinator Cheyenne. She is passionate in
what she does, being efficient and prompt and ensuring all the small details were taken care of without us needing to worry about them. Thank you Cheyenne for your professionalism and being accommodative to our requests. We are glad to have entrusted you and your team one of our most important milestone in our life. The service provided highly exceeded our expectations.

During the trial run, banquet manager Alwin gave us useful tips on things to look out for. He was proactive in providing suggestions on how to improve our wedding programme. Although Alwin was working the night shift on our banquet day, he surprised us by turning up early and assisting us for the 2nd march in.

On our banquet day, banquet manager Boon Wee and team ensured that the event
flow was well taken care of. The dish serving timing was well coordinated and sequence of event were well-briefed to emcees and AV in-charge.

Banquet staff Siang Yee was assigned to assist the bride on the day. She was courteous, thoughtful and attentive to all our needs, anticipating what was needed before we thought of it, helping with the wedding dress and the bride throughout the lunch banquet. Although we were very nervous before march-in, her amazing service and confidence put us at ease. Serving us with honey water before march in and reassuring us so that we will not be nervous during the march-in.

Everything at Crowne plaza exceeded our expectations, from the pillarless ballroom and excellent food prepared by Crystal Jade to the romantic and cosy bridal suite with a great view of the runway made a lasting impression on this memorable occasion for us.

You do need to go through custom and enter Singapore to stay there however.

The breakfast is not great but ok, the swimming pool is quite nice.

However one massive Problem in my view. The staff is poorly trained. And very, very slow with no sense of urgency.

Yesterday I waited for check in for 22 minutes.

For a hotel that caters to business travelers who have little time, and usually very short nights, it is in my view a massive downside. In the most efficient airport in the world. By the time they manage to check you in you will already be in the city center.

Peer down and it‚Äôs the mammoth swimming pool that spells oasis. As an avid traveler, I dare say this is one of the best club lounge I‚Äôve ever set foot upon. The service is so attentive and warm, all owing to Raymond the beaming star. He effortlessly juggled all duties including mad cocktail O‚Äôclock from 5.30-8.30 PM. There‚Äôs even a cocktail menu where the slings, mai tai‚Äôs and cosmo‚Äôs are served to you versus the self pours I usually experience.

All staff from the front desk to club lounge and even members of the housekeeping crew always carries a friendly smile and greets you like an old friend.

Breakfast at Azur was good with a nice balance of western and asian selection. Evening cocktails and canap√© at the club lounge is still amazing and delicious as our previous stay, there is wide enough selection of food to combine into a meal. Definitely good value.

First and foremost, we would like to give thanks to our wedding coordinator, Jesmi. From the very first meeting till the day of our wedding, she has been a professional, assuring and calming presence throughout. Her follow-ups were quick and she was also very accommodating to some of our last-minute requests. Sometimes, she would even highlight some of the things that we should look out for, before we had even thought about it. Throughout the entire process, we knew we were in safe hands and we are so glad that we had entrusted her with one of the most important milestones in our life.

Next, we would like to give thanks to the banquet team led by Boon Wee. The service was prompt and the entire event was well-executed. Boon Wee was reliable and efficient and was proactive in providing suggestions on how we could further improve our wedding programme. I would also like to highlight the two banquet staff that were in charge of opening the doors for us before both of our march-ins. My wife and I were feeling slightly nervous as her dress was pretty bulky and our worst fear was of her or myself or both of us tripping during the march-in. The two staff were very assuring and their confident smiles gave us confidence too.

We would also like to highlight the amazing service of one of the banquet staff, Siang Yee. She was responsible for staying by my wife‚Äôs side throughout the entire banquet to help her with the wedding dresses. She was very observant and often anticipated what we needed before we were even aware. Her confidence in carrying out her tasks really put us at ease.

When I was booking, I was conscious we needed to stay at a place close to the airport given my grandmother‚Äôs age. When I looked at the price, I was dubious because it wasn‚Äôt cheap by any means, but this place is exceptional!

The hotel is very convenient from the airport ‚Äì it‚Äôs literally a 5-minute walk from the baggage carousel.

I had been in email contact with the hotel in the lead-up to our holiday given we would need to catch a plane at midnight ‚Äì they were more than happy to make arrangements for a day- rate. They were also very kind to upgrade us at check-in which was a lovely surprise!

Both my grandmother and I require refrigeration for medications and they kept our cool-bag in a freezer for us to ensure when we left the next day our medicine would remain refrigerated.

The room itself was super roomy ‚Äì two queen beds and a couple of chairs to sit in at the foot of each bed. There was also a desk if you needed to work and the bathroom had a massive tub and a separate shower.

In terms of hotel amenities, there are so many restaurants to choose from - we dined at Azur both evenings. When booking online we just requested not to have the buffet selection and ordered a la carte. All meals were delicious and reasonably priced.

I also went to the hotel lobby for cold drinks on occasion and the staff were so friendly and helpful. A credit to the hotel.

My grandmother and I both had spa treatments ‚Äì she got a neck and leg massage and I had a full body massage. It was incredible!

The pool is beautiful ‚Äì if we had been staying longer, I would have used it. Despite the airport at your doorstep, it‚Äôs tranquil and peaceful.

Date of stay: September 2019,Rafflesia,Pit stop,"My wife and I deliberately chose this hotel as a pit stop for our visit to the Jewel and various seafood joints at East Coast park.
All credit to the hotel allowing us an early checkin at 1230 and for the upgrade to the next room category up (due to my Ambassador status) allowing us time to freshen up before setting off discovering the Jewel and the seafood restaurants at East Coast (Chilli Crab - yum).
We initially considered another accommodation option located within the Jewel itself which was offering discounted room rates during this soft opening period. However, the larger rooms together with the upgrade made us decide on the former. Lets just say it was really special to be able to retreat back to the comfort of one's room, rest and then continue with shopping and dining within the Jewel complex until your hearts content (some F&B outlets at the basement of the Jewel close at 1 am).
As for my upgraded Premier room ( from deluxe) on level 7, it was ok and nothing to shout about. It was quiet enough and had sufficient number of international plugs to accommodate electrical devices of foreign visitors. However, the firmness of the bed, one of the down-lights and the weighing scale not working together with the lack of a disposable razor (which apparently can be requested through Housekeeping) served as a good reminder to moderate expectations.
As our stay this time was only about 16 hours, am unable to give a fair review regarding the quality of the staff. The ladies who checked us in and out were professional and polite, I was acknowledged by my surname when requesting for an early wake up call, however, there was no acknowledgement of my loyalty status. to sum up, service was professional, very much like a business transaction but nothing memorable.",,"Perth, Australia",670 ,277 ,4.0,

The room was very spacious overlooking the airport runways but there was no sound or disturbance. It was much roomier than expected with a nice bathroom with bathtub and a walk in shower.
There is also a really nice pool area with palm trees and other plants around which the pool is set up.
This hotel was ideal for us as we were there overnight coming in from Vietnam for a connection early the following morning and could just walk to the terminal for check in.

Tried ordering a bottle of prosecco and 5 minutes later room service called saying they were out and could only serve champagne at triple the price. Although we love champanhe it was simple not what we were looking for. As I had seen bottles of prosecco at the lobby bar less than one hour before, I decided to go down and purchase it directly ... the so called lobby bar which is supposed to be opened to 10pm refused to serve me at 9:35pm without me even opening my mouth to order. A very frustrating return to this place that had already disappointed us 2 years ago by giving very wrong information! I would not recommend.

After travelling for business and pleasure for over 30 years and staying at hotels worldwide, I have today been charged my first ever ‚Äúearly Check in fee‚Äù of $S160.

We have just arrive in Singapore after a 16 hour flight from Europe and are overnighting at Changi Airport Crowne Plaza as we have an onward flight early tomorrow morning.

We arrived at the hotel at approx 9.30 am and was told that our room, although ready would not be available to us until 3.30 pm which is their check in time(?) and that if we wanted access to the room early that we would have to pay an early check in fee of approx S$160 on top of the daily room rate that we had already paid for.

Being jet lagged and exhausted we had no choice but to pay the outrageous early check in fee for a room that was already vacant and ready and for which we have paid the full daily rate.

Never in all of my years of travelling have I ever been asked for an early check in fee. At every single hotel that I have stayed in during the last 30 plus years (from 1 to 5 stars), if the room was ready and empty when I arrived, I would be given immediate access. Not so at the Crown Plaza Changi Airport Hotel.

I will never be staying at this hotel again!.

Date of stay: July 2019,Astrid J,"Good Enough, But Hardly Excellent","I first stayed at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport when it was newly opened and another time two years ago, just after the opening of the Jewel Wing. Unfortunately, the Premier Wing is showing signs of age and some maintenance works are necessary. I had booked a Premier Room with a Runway View this time around and returned after a long evening to discover that the bathtub was faulty (the stopper does not seal and it is therefore impossible to fill the tub). As it was already past midnight, my partner and I decided to not pursue the matter. In addition, one of the lights in the room was not working.

In view of its location, it is very likely that I will stay at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport again, but I am now much less inclined to recommend it.

You need to flush twice to clear the papers etc. quite a waste of water. 2) maybe it‚Äôs school holidays or the Jewel, the club lounge during cocktail hour was quite packed.

2) Variety of Breakfast was better than expected, I wanted Americano but was given a Singapore style black coffee which had too strong of a brew. There was smoked salmon as well.

3) Had a $30 credits that came with the booking.

4) Gave 4 water bottles, extra soap and the dental set came with a floss.

5) Nice swimming pool.

The not so good
1) Was pleasantly surprised that there were coffee capsules machine in the room but it didnt work, coffee barely dripped out.

2) Could heard the banging of doors from outside, multiple times.

3) Drain Cover of Bath Tub was not working and was unable to cover the hole. Only found out about this when I wanted to use it in the morning of my check-out day. Had booked this type of room to use the bath tub.

The link to the Jewel is good, although I wish they made it easier to connect to in the Jewel wing. Currently you have to walk all the way back to the reception to then go to the Jewel.

The breakfast was so so, not really 5* but more around a 4* breakfast i.e the orange juice wasn't freshly squeezed, and some of the food tasted processed. Also, I found the reception to be pretty dark and the decor there to be bad. Luckily the room made up for it! I'm not going to deduct a star on this, but this is what I found to be bad in the hotel.

Before I came to the hotel I ha read excellent reviews about The Club lounge and it's manager Raymond. In my opinion theses reviews do not go far enough. Raymond and his team are amazing.

Located outside terminal 3, you get to go through the passport control first and then without walking out of the airport itself you have arrived. Another brilliant feature of the hotel is that it is right next to the brand-new oasis which is the Jewel! The Jewel is the incredible fountain slash shopping mall destination which makes your stop over even better than ever. You have the 24hour food court or restaurants that close at 10pm within 10 minutes walk of the hotel. The room itself was huge with very comfortable ameneties.

It had both a bath and a shower.  There are switches to lower and raise two window blinds.  There was a glass wall between the bathroom and sleeping area.  There is another switch to turn it opaque.  There was both a hand held and rain shower.  The bath was in front of the window.There was a settee with a table.  Complimentary bottles of water.  The safe was in a drawer of the desk.  The air con was efficient and quite quiet. Two or three empty standard sockets were available, but only one USB socket.  Wi-Fi was fast and easy to connect to.

Date of stay: May 2019,serenehosl,Lovely hotel with easy access to the airport,"I have always wanted to stay at the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport but never did so because parking was not complimentary and I had to pay over $50 a day to park my car in the airport. I was reading about the new mall at the airport, the Jewel,t and decided to check out the hotel site on a whim and I was delighted to see that there was a Rest and Relax Room package which came with complimentary parking and late check out of 4pm. I booked a suite immediately as I was eager to go to the new Jewel mall in the airport.

It was really easy for me to make my way to the lobby from the car park as there are trolleys available at the car park. The lobby looked nice but check in was a little slow as there were just 2 staff on duty. I did not like the lifts to the rooms as they look dated and lack ventilation.My room key card malfunctioned and I was unable to get to my level and I was stuck in the lift for a few minutes with the door closed and the elevator was moving randomly between levels 1 and 2. I was sweating buckets and panicked a little but I managed to get out when the doors finally opened. I got my key card changed at the receptionist and when I got to my level I realised that this hotel has an open air corridor concept so it could get hot in the day and it also gets wet when it rains.

The suite was a good size. There was a huge study table and also a round table and a sofa in the living room. There was also a powder room in the living room so guests do not have to venture to the bedroom to use the toilet.

The bedroom was a good size too and the bed was comfortable. I loved the clock radio by the bed and turned it on all day. The view from the room was of the expressway and the airport control tower. Although the hotel was adjacent to the airport it was pretty quiet and I could barely hear the sounds of aeroplanes from the bedroom. There are some rooms that face the runway and this may be a little noisier but it is a treat to be able to see plans taxiing down the runway.

The toilet came with a bathtub and a separate shower stall. I was very satisfied with the size of the toilet and it would have been perfect if the toilet seats came with automated heating and cleaning functions.

My suite came with lounge access and the food and cocktails in the lounge were really good and it is really worth it to get a room with lounge access. The suite faces the pool and the pool was beautifully decorated with plants in the middle of the pool.

What I like best about the hotel is its proximity to the hotel and to the new Jewel mall. You can get to the various airport terminals and the Jewel in airconditioned comfort and there no no need to worry about getting caught in the rain. There are many 24 hours dining options in the airport so it is easy to walk out for a meal even in the wee hours of the morning, The Jewel mall is truly spectacular and features the world's largest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex. The waterfall is stunning with beautiful lights and there are even daily light shows.The Jewel is a huge mall with many shops and there is no need to go to the malls in the city as you can find everything you want there. There is even a cinema in the Jewel.

I really enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza and I have booked another stay to take advantage of the free parking promotion which ends on 30th June.

I literally started gagging and could not eat anything else from the hotel. I informed the manager who then tried to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù me to eat the other things I had ordered not realizing the extent of disgust and trauma that comes with the first thing I ate. I did not care to get a refund I wanted it out of my face but he refused and insisted and I wasn‚Äôt going to argue with him. I unfortunately did not take a photo of it, I wish i had! THEN, I tried to go to bed and noticed the sheets were RIPPED meaning their life span has ended but they refuse to change it! I had asked them twice to remove the old sheets with wholes in them and provide ones without them. They said no problem and when I came back to see if they did... they just FLIPPED the sheets so I wouldn‚Äôt see it.

It‚Äôs 9.25pm and the idea of a iced coffees and a sweet sounds nice... oops sorry the lobby lounge is closing in 5 minutes at 9.30pm....??? Go figure .. to be fair there is a bar and a restaurant on the 2nd floor. The bar is a one of those horrible Fluro places dark with coloured lights and mirrors everywhere ... yuk... and the restaurant is well .. naff said. Decide to make a coffee in the room ...oops the espresso machine doesn‚Äôt work either!

Guess this place would be fine if you just wanted a place to shower and sleep and catch the next flight it would be fine as the rooms are good, however if you wat to do a little more forget it.

The directions to the hotel within the airport other than within Terminal 3 are non existent
as is supporting documentation on the net and the map link on the hotels webiste takes you to a link on google maps which is nonsensical.

Evidently Taxis will not take fares to this location after a certain time ie for us we stoped three taxis at 8.30pm and they all refused the fare.

It‚Äôs a 53 minute mrt trip from Chinatown with inurmerable stops

Being adjacent to a large terminal provided plenty of dining options, which we used so I cannot report on the hotel restaurants. My wife did however note an absence of tea bags in the room. Check out again was a surprise when the staff member doing the check out decided to make an unrelated phone call in the middle of the checking out, which seemed to be able to be made after attending to me. But overall an excellent option for a Singapore stopover.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",109 ,18 ,5.0,

On this trip, we stayed here on two occasions. On the first overnight stay, we booked one of the cheaper business rooms in the Jewel Tower. The room was quite new, well equipped, spotlessly clean and with a great bathroom. The downside is that these rooms are small for a couple lugging suitcases and wanting to repack etc during a short stay. There is about a metre between the end of the bed and the wall. Ideal for singles though.  On our next, longer, stay, we booked an executive room overlooking the pool and put our name in for an upgrade to Club level.

The only confusing bit is that reception is on the ground level but you enter on a higher level.  After a long flight it is great to have access to luxury, space and comfort.  Noise levels were great and you could barely hear the planes.  We decided to eat in the hotel which tries to push the buffet, which I guess is easier, but as we weren't that hungry we just wanted to order something small, and so service was very slow.  Breakfast the next morning had a good choice and service was faster.    It certainly feels so good to see a pool when you are so close to the airport.

The club meant that we had a breakfast included, eggs cooked to order; coffee served; the remainder a buffet. The club lounge manager, Raymond, was always friendly and willing to help. The evening snacks in the lounge were sufficient for a light meal, and the drinks were generous.
The room was comfortable with very minimal aircraft noise.

The location was very handy for the vast choice of quality airport restaurants, and also for transport to the city.

Upon check-in we were upgraded to a premier room with a view of the pool, due to being members of the IHG rewards program. That was a nice touch! We also got a complimentary tote bag, which was a nice gesture.

I loved the view as it felt very tropical looking out onto the pool and the gardens. We also saw and heard plenty of planes taking off but it wasn't too loud.

The room had a bath tub which was great after a long flight. There was also a desk and lots of space including a couch. The only downside was that the TV was a fair distance from the bed so I found it a bit hard to see the TV screen properly from bed.

The breakfast buffet was great and I would have allowed more time to enjoy it before heading over to the check in for our flight! Also, because it's essentially in the airport, you can check out the food for dinner or a snack at the Changi food court, which is on one of the lower grounds. There's a huge range of options and even a supermarket, dry cleaners, children's playground, and more. You can easily spend time around this area if you're short on time and can't leave the Changi precinct.

I was disappointed that I couldn't try out the gym or the spa as it looked great. They also do in-room massages too.

Upon checkout we received really great customer service. We were asked genuinely how our stay was and we were helped with loading our bags on to a trolley to take next door to the departures area.

Despite the business of this hotel, I found that all staff really appeared to be doing their best at all times to serve everyone quickly and they appeared to really love their job.

The venue itself is amazing and considering you are right at the airport you would not know that there are aeroplanes landing and taking off around you.
The check in process was first class, friendly, polite, professional, however, that is where the compliments end.
The food and beverage service is sub standard to say the least.
Despite Champagne and Prosecco on the menu as available by the glass my wife and I were advised at the three different bars within the hotel that the Chandon and the Bottega were not available and had not been for sometime, perplexing to say the least ü§î.
In addition, according to the drinks menu at the pool bar, apparently a new type of wine known as the Cabernet Chardonnay 2015 was available, now, being from a wine background this was totally foreign to me, who‚Äôd have thought...?
The ‚Äúservice‚Äù in the Lobby Bar was appalling to say the least as was the food.

Of course you don‚Äôt.....because some how through great construction (or possibly magic) you don‚Äôt hear the giant planes taking off next to the hotel.  Very impressive!  The hotel itself is a one of a kind design, not your typical big box hotel.  Seems like a big architectural art project. I really liked the water pools outside the club lounge - kind of an instant zen moment for me.  The club lounge was nice, good food and drinks but the L shaped layout is a little strange; sit by the food because the drink service is quicker - when it gets crowded the hard working service staff never quite make it to the other side of the L.  The gym was also good, everything you could need and it looks out into an interior garden.  The downside is that it also looks into the outdoor smoking lounge; but hey that means you should feel that much better that you are exercising!Now here is the real treasure:  the breakfast buffet!  Anything you could want for both the Asian palette and this American one.  They have a pancake machine that makes the best pancakes I have ever had.  You simply push the button and it starts spitting out perfect silver dollar pancakes.  Why these aren‚Äôt standard in every room I don‚Äôt know.... Maybe one day I will do enough IHG reviews and they will send me one!In short, if you have a long layover do yourself a favor and book at this hotel.

Room Service: For those of us who aren‚Äôt used to have everything on a device this was something new, because the room service menu is not printed but displayed on the tv.
Breakfast at Azur: I recommend to call and check the breakfast closing time because I saw on the information provided said 11am but when I was told by front desk and later on by the restaurant staff it closes at 10:30am so if you plan to go late in the morning better confirm. Food in breakfast great as always, good selection, it was delicious that‚Äôs all I can say but because we went exactly by closing time we had to rush and get the food quickly although the restaurant people delayed closing time to wait for us, so that was really nice if them.
Buffet Dinner at Azur: great selection, it does get busy so I recommend don‚Äôt leave it to last minute.

Our flight landed in Terminal 2, and Crowne is outside of Tetminal 3. I mistakenly thought the hotel is in terminal 3, so we ended up have to go out of terminal 2 and walked over to terminal 3.

We wanted to see Singapore but due to early morning departure it made sense to stay close to airport- and the hotel didn't disappoint! Check in was breeze. The accommodation with a King size bed was spacious and Singapore clean. The room was well insulated and you could not hear the planes landing or people next door- great for a good night‚Äôs sleep.

It really is an airport hotel, connected to T3. Our room was fine and wed selected the Club option for early evening snacks. However we just wanted to chill by the pool. However the sun beds were incredibly uncomfortable and due to the location and its layout most of the pool when were were there was in shade. The sunny side with chairs is not for general use and just for the rooms that over look the pool so 50% of the pool is not available to sit in. We gave up after 3 hours as there was no sun and the chairs were uncomfortable. It was almost as if they should have had cushions but they weren't provided. We adjourned to the room and watched the planes! I used the gym in the afternoon and it is excellent. Really modern equipment. We went to the Club lounge at 5.30 for snacks and drinks. It was ramped with many children. The food selection was OK but the drinks are served by staff and it seemed to take an eternity to get them.

It was a Wow, Wow and Wow exclamation when we opened the room door.  Our room, located at level 6, was spacious with ceiling to floor window.  We had an extra bed and it was still spacious to move around in the room.  The Housekeeping staff helped us to move the sofa and the round coffee table to the window and we practically glued ourselves to the sofa watching the planes landing on the runway one after one.  In our room, each time we hear the sound of each plane landing from outside our room, we will quickly look at the window and find a plane landing.On our first day in the room, it was full day viewing of planes landing.  On the second day, it was a full day viewing of planes taking off.  And we don‚Äôt want to sleep at night, because we want to see the planes landing and taking off!The bathroom was nice with a bathtub and a separate shower area.  Suitable to meet the needs of different guests staying in the same room.

The hotel is extremely convenient for layovers, or for a one night stay. It is clean, affordable, exterior relatively new, service is excellent and it's relatively affordable.

The rooms are clean and large for the price you pay. The linens are really white, and bed really soft. There's plenty of space for you to store your things, and I liked the design philosophy. The furniture were well arranged, and the entire room was aesthetically pleasing. Everything worked well, including the airconditioning. However, the rooms are old. It's not obvious, as they are well cleaned and maintained, but the signs are there. There are stains on the walls, bathtub, shower, sink. Those are minor gripes however. The rooms are good.

The amenities are good as well. The gym is large, and pool well designed and maintained. The breakfast was actually REALLY good. The buffet area was large and there was a wide selection of food that were tasty.

In conclusion, this is a good hotel. Especially so if you're laying over or staying for one night and do not wish to venture too far into Singapore.

Date of stay: December 2018,TwinkleStar1818,airport hotel with a different experience,"we have decided to do a staycation at Crowne Plaza this year after reading so much good reviews about it.

We booked a room with runway view and the experience for the stay was a very pleasant one.

the hotel is very well connected to Changi airport and accessible via MRT station, so anyone can easily access the hotel. it is possibly the nearest hotel that is so close to airport that i have seen so far. The checkin process was fast, and before we know, we were given the keys to our room.

Our runway view room was located on the 6th floor. As what many fedback, the hotel is more like a resort than a conventional hotel, so the corridor outside the rooms are non-airconditioned.

The room was also bigger than expected. My boys did not have much good impression of airport hotels, but this one is an exception. The bathroom was big; other than the bathtub, there is also an enclosed shower area beside the toilet bowl. The boys are fascinated by the fact that you can soak at the tub and yet see the planes landing down from the bathroom.

The pool was also pretty unique. It was unexpectedly cooling in the mid afternoon even though it was unsheltered. The adults could enjoy the breeze at the pool side while seeing the planes taking off from the other side of the airport, while the kids could play hide and seek in the ""maze"" at the pool.

As it is very well connected to the airport, and the terminals at the airport are very well connected, anyone would be spoilt for choices of food during the stay.

As we were staying during one of the boys' birthday, the hotel has also provided a birthday cake (with candles and matches) for us to celebrate the boy's birthday in a room. They are the first thoughtful hotel that we came across that provides these (as these are the items that the hotel will only provides upon request).

The only 2 minus point items were:
1) the teaspoon found in the hotel room was not clean properly. There was still residue of chocs or coffee on the spoon (but this is something minor since we will always wash the utensils in the room when we use)
2) the buffet breakfast provides quite a good spread but the quality was not as good as what we had experienced elsewhere. The indian food (putu mayam was not steamed enough and it tasted like it was fresh from the freezer mins the ice, it was the hardest putu mayam that i have ever eaten. The fried noodles was simply too oily, but maybe it's the way the chefs wanted to cook it, and the grilled tomatoes were extremely salty.

As we chose the hotel more for its uniqueness in viewing the planes at the comfort of the room, these minus points did not become the spoiler for the short break.

All in all, the service staff are very efficient. If you are considering staying there, i would recommend you to try other food places at Terminal 3 which is connected to the airport, instead of eating at the restaurant that provides the breakfast at the hotel.

We will definitely go back again to stay at this hotel. Once again, thanks to the team of staff who makes this staycation a special one and the birthday boy was extremely satisfied with the experience.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",67 ,82 ,,4.0

Big bed, friendly staff and as we arrived way early, our room was ready. It was a five minute walk from our room to Terminal 3 which was huge and all decorated up for the holidays with a Harry Potter theme.

Date of stay: December 2018,David Michael S,Have stayed about 150 times over the years but won't be staying again :(,"Over the past 7-8 years, I've stayed at this hotel more than 150 times. It's been a convenient place to crash in between flights to/from Manila and Australia. I've liked it for four main reasons but three of those have now gone.

1. Many filipino staff. Though not being filipino, I've lived in Manila for 14 years and appreciate the smiling helpful filipino style service & the excellent English. Gradually the filipino staff have left and the staff there now has mixed nationalities though the overall level of friendliness and definitely English language capability has deteriorated markedly, especially with the room service staff.

2. Small but adequate gym with heavier duty Technogym equipment. As someone who goes to the gym every day, I've become quite particular with the stationary bikes and elliptical trainers I like and don't like. Precor and Technogym make durable heavy duty equipment. Life Fitness make wimpy lightweight equipment. The hotel has doubled the size of its' gym but replaced all the equipment I liked with new Life Fitness stuff. I'm sure no big deal to most people, but I don't like it.

3. Room service menu good selection and fast. In what I assume is an effort to make the tradeoff between convenience for customers and operating costs, the hotel has gone to a TV based menu (not unusual these days) and 'shopping cart' ordering system (still pretty rare in decent hotels). I may be old and less 'digital' than others but I tried to order a meal using the TV multiple times and couldn't get what I wanted. Even more irritating was calling the 'service' extension and being told to use the TV. Yet .again even more irritating was after wasting 10 min of my life on the TV, another few minutes placing order on phone, I get a call back that the wine I ordered wasn't available (even though it was the room service staff who read off to me the available wines) And my irritation level increased when the guy calling me saying the wine wasn't available asked me to hold while he figured things out. Of course I just hung up and amazingly the wine I ordered showed up with my order. So we have a) people who don't know what they do and don't have in stock, b) colleagues who don't communicate with each other, and c) staff who make the tradeoff that a customer's time is less important than their time to figure out what is going on

4. I always get a room on the 3rd floor which means I can open the glass door directly onto the pool and sit outside by my room enjoying the sound of the water and relaxing. Hasn't changed. Still a plus.

Get that what matters to me may not matter to other Trip Advisor readers but I will be taking a taxi into the Fairmont (great gym, great room service & ok staff) in the city instead of staying at Crown Plaza in the future.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Makati, Philippines",309 ,179 ,3.0,

I enjoyed the unconventional architecture and modern design of the hotel. The pool is stunning with the air traffic control tower and planes taking off in the background.

The Club Lounge evening foods/cocktails and full breakfast easily made up the difference in price between a regular and Club Level Room-I urge you to get access if you can-it is well worth it.

As my day flight to Sydney was relatively early in the morning staying at this hotel was ideal.  Once you enter the hotel you have very little sense of it being in an airport, which is good.  Both check-in and check-out at the hotel were slow and the queues were not insignificant, so sufficient time should be allowed particularly for check out if you have a plane to catch.

We had very little trouble finding the hotel after arriving at terminal three and clearing customs. It's well sign posted.

Checkin was fine, no problems with our booking or choice of room being available. We had booked a room with a runway view (executive room maybe). On arrival in the room, I was a little disappointed with the room layout, decor and the quality of the fittings, for example the bathroom fixtures were clumsy and cheap looking. It was no problem though, just a bit of a surprise given the reputation that this hotel has. Rooms were reasonably quiet, but you could certainly hear and feel the larger jets departing.

The quality of the beds (and bedding linen) at the Crowne Plaza will not give the people at Sofitel any sleepless nights, that's for sure. While it was accceptable, this is one obvious area for improvement. After spending a large amount of time in an uncomfortable metal tube, a great nights sleep in a really comfortable bed would have been greatly appreciated.

Date of stay: November 2018,197gabes,A true gem at Changi Airport,"Having a hotel at a world class airport sets the expectation really high from many. In my personal view the Crowne Plaza Changi Airport has managed to deliver on all counts and is now my new favorite among the IHG hotels in Singapore.

Check in was fast and efficient. The room was spacious and well kept. There is sufficient on site facilities (pool, spa and sports bar) to keep any average guest occupied (with the view of the runway or the control tower thrown in as a bonus). Service is always friendly and efficient at all levels from the front desk to housekeeping. Check out was also equally easy and stress free.

The breakfast spread at Azur has a good variety of local and international choices, and the combination of items varied just slightly so that you do not get bored with the same item even if staying for more than a day. Room service was equally good, food came nicely presented and warm, served again by a friendly staff.

The exterior of the hotel also looks amazing. The only negative comment is that the lobby area and walkway to the restaurants is just too dark. But that is just a personal taste of deco and does not take away any positives of the place.

We arrived late at night and were leaving late the next morning so unfortunately couldn‚Äôt make use of the many facilities. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. There was also a good sized shower and large size bath. The blackout curtains lived up to their name and we didn‚Äôt hear any aircraft noise in the room. There was a USB port in the room for charging and also a Handy phone that we could use to make free calls to Australia. It seemed you could also take this phone out with you whilst sightseeing in Singapore.

I feel the room was designed for just a one night stopover and a place to catch up on work. There was a small couch but not a lot of area to sit around in. If you are staying for a few nights, you may want to look at one of the larger rooms.

We had buffet breakfast included and it was a huge selection. The staff in reception and also the staff in the buffet were very courteous, efficient and attentive.

Whilst it is adjacent to terminal 3, it was also a quick walk to terminal 2 across the mezzanine level air link bridge.

If we had a long transit in Singapore again, we would definitely stay here instead of one of the transit hotels.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",44 ,2 ,5.0,

The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever had. Plenty of western, asian and indian cuisine plus you could see the chefs cooking the food directly in front of you due to the open kitchens.

Date of stay: October 2018,skippy82,Short stay at a great hotel ,"We stayed one night after arriving from Australia and prior to connecting to a Bintan ferry.

Check-in was easy and they had organised an interconnecting room as we had requested. We have two children (5 & 7) and can usually find a room with two double beds but this wasn‚Äôt a room option at the Crowne Plaza.

The rooms were nice with comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms. We were exhausted after our flight so ordered room service. We had an issue with one of the kids meals (not what we ordered) and they quickly sorted it out.

We used the pool which was lovely and refreshing.

The breakfast buffet was extensive and good quality.

Overall a great experience and I would stay again.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",26 ,36 ,5.0,
Date of stay: September 2018,Combatfisher,Very nice hotel,I stayed at the Crown Plaza Changi airport hotel for 1 night while I was in Singapore.  It was just a short stay because I was attending a conference in a different hotel and I showed-up 1 day early to try to do some fly fishing while I was there.The hotel is very nice.  It's clean.  My recommendation is to try to get a room next to the swimming pool.  The room I had by the garden was nice but a bit boring.  We were right next to the airport and I was concerned that I would hear airplane noise...but it was very quiet...no noise at all.Hotel management might want to check out the plug for the hair dryer and the outlet in the bathroom.  They are different...not a big problem since you can use a plug outside in the bedroom...,Trip type: Travelled solo,"Taipei, Taiwan",2687 ,237 ,,5.0
Date of stay: September 2018,Tina K,Great spot to stay before leaving Singapore,"We decided to spend our last night here near the airport and were able to check in early, then go and explore Changi Village, which was about 15 minutes by taxi away. I was a bit hesitant as my husband wanted to stay in a premium runway view room, but it was spacious and very, very quiet. It was actually quite interesting seeing the planes coming in and landing but it didn't prevent me from sleeping at all. The ensuite was clean and large enough to accommodate a bath tub. I found the bed and the pillows very comfortable. The swimming pool was lovely, large and refreshing for a dip. It might sound weird having a swimming pool overlooking the airport but we thoroughly enjoyed it and made sure we had a quick swim the next morning before we departed. Breakfast was included and it was a nice enough selection, but really just typical of a hotel buffet breakfast. Being literally joined to Terminal 3, it was actually really nice to go check out the airport shops and the food court in the evening. We ended up having a meal there and whilst it wasn't as cheap as eating at a real Hawkers market, it was reasonably priced ($13 for a bento set and a terriyaki meal) and very good quality. The next morning we had a swim, breakfast, checked out and took a leisurely stroll through to Terminal 2. It was all very stress free and I can highly recommend staying there, especially if you have an early flight. The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5, is whilst the location is super convenient, apart from the airport you'd need a taxi to take you anywhere else as there's nothing else here.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Perth,43 ,21 ,4.0,

Not quite up to the spreads you would find in present day Las Vegas but a very good effort I would look forward to anytime. Very fun to indulge in little bits of the local food you have in front of you.  A lot of local fare to choose from.  The rooms were upscale, very clean and neat. Very comfortable.   I thought I would hear the planes taking off and landing but I can't say I was ever aware of them.  Yet, you can see them out the window.

checking in/out were hassle free, receptionist helped us signed up for membership to get complimentary late check out, which was a really nice gesture.
room was bigger than our expectations. bedding super comfortable, one of the best we ever had. love the open concept of the bathtub where we get to supervise the Child without having to be inside the toilet.
had dinner buffet and food was amazing!!! breakfast buffet did not disappoint too.
what really impress us was when we tried to log into the room wifi, we were prompt to complete a survey. and within minutes from submitting the survey, we received a call that wanted to assist us in a small feedback we indicated in the survey.
we spotted a few ants here and there but it wasn't any issues and it wasn't bothering us so we didn't call housekeeping. but I mentioned this casually in the survey just as a feedback. and the hotel called the room and send somebody up to check on it right away. they even offered to change a new room for us which we declined because we were comfortable. this is the one hotel that takes feedback seriously and attend to it immediately. felt so pampered.

We got a cake as we mentioned it was our anniversary, which was a nice touch, but the thing that made the hotel a 5-star review for me was having Raymond and Zoey look after us in the executive lounge..

Date of stay: September 2018,tntdubai,Brilliant Place to Stay and Relax within Airport Area,"Its a excellent Hotel located right inside the Terminal 3 just after Arrival and hence you will need to clear immigration to use the hotel. All terminals at Changi Airport (1, 2 & 3) are connected by Sky Train and hence you can actually land at any terminal and still can access the hotel.
The Hotel is actually a 4.5star property which has very modern concept in design, and uses the most basic materials and design. It has created open passages connecting the guest rooms which makes the staying experience unique as normally the modern city hotel are totally enclosed property. Here you can stand outside your room and looks at plane landing and taking off.
The hotel building is in 2 rectangular U shaped format with rooms laid out in line. The building is 9 floor high and houses Swimming Pool, Gym, Lounge, Spa, Beverage Vending Machines, Coffee Shop & Restaurants. All necessary day to day items are available in Terminal 3 basement convenience store incld bags, medicine etc which can be purchased at reasonable price, which also makes it a ideal place to stay with families who like to dine in room or go out and eat at 20+restaurants and food court located just next door. The hotel is connected by city via Metro (MRT), Buses and Taxis. The city center is 25-30mins away.
The Regular Business or Premier rooms are quite large compared to the current hotel size rooms in the city and have all the basic amenities like Soap, Shampoo , Toothbrush etc. , hairdryer, minibar, Nespresso machine with free capsules, Hot Water Kettle, ironing board and iron. The room has Number Safe to keep your valuables.

All rooms comes with attached bathroom with Glass Partitions (which can actually be covered by a curtain and hence gives full privacy to bathroom user. The bathroom has a bathtub and a shower cubicle as well. The room has a Sofa as well as a Writing desk adequately large for a family of 4 to comfortably hang around in the room.

The hotel I presume is 10+ years old and hence needs a little maintenance, but overall I found the rooms absolutely clean and in perfect condition for this 3 night stay at Changi Airport.

Please ask for rooms facing to Runway is you are a Airplane freak or else ask for a Quiet zone rooms. Do use the higher floor as they seem to have a better view. Since the layout of the hotel is such that rooms are located far from elevator (100 mtrs away), it would be advisable for people who dont want to walk a lot to ask rooms closer to elevators.

Being a Elite Spire Member I was given a upgrade as access to Club Lounge which is on the 3rd floor and serves Breakfast in the morning as well as complete snack in the evening with drinks. Its a nice place to sit and have meetings, but there are many other place in hotel and terminal building, where you can hang around and if with kids you have the whole Airport Terminal 3 play area to leave them.

Would love to stay here again as the Staff is very polite and helpful in their response.

Date of stay: August 2018,MrsFuzzyBear,"Noisy air-conditioning, but otherwise very nice","We were in transit for a night, with arriving and departing flights from terminal 1. The Crowne Plaza is just off terminal 3, but it was very quick and easy to get between terminals (and therefore to the hotel) via the Skytrain.
We had a room in the ‚ÄòJewel Wing‚Äô, which was very unusual and modern in design. We were surprised that the bathroom had the full length window to the outside, with natural light coming into the main room through the bathroom. There were daytime and blackout blinds for the large bathroom window, both operated by switches on the wall. Our window had an airport view ‚Äì not a direct runway view, but interesting nevertheless. Between the bathroom and main room, there were sliding glass doors ‚Äì However, at the flick of a ‚Äòprivacy‚Äô switch, the glass doors turned from transparent to opaque, giving complete privacy in the bathroom! There were nice toiletries and plenty of towels, a bathtub right under the full-length window, and a separate shower.
The main room was compact, but well equipped with all the usual things you would expect, including safe, tea/coffee making facility, towelling robes and complimentary slippers; and ‚Äìalways a bonus point with me ‚Äì bottles of complimentary mineral water.
We used the swimming pool in the evening. It was quite late and dark, and it was interesting to see the lights of the airport control tower, and to watch the planes coming and going, while swimming! They were doing some work around the pool so part of the surrounding area was boarded off, but the pool itself was unaffected. The pool was a great temperature (not too hot or too cold) and an attractive design with palm trees around. Towels were provided nearby.
So ‚Ä¶ why the poor rating? The main problem was that the air conditioning in the room was incredibly noisy, even at the lowest fan setting. I turned it off to try to sleep, but then woke up because of being too hot ‚Äì the room temperature had risen to 27 degrees. We were staying here for a transit stopover between long flights, so a poor night‚Äôs sleep because of the aircon rather missed the point of the stay.
Secondly ‚Äì although much less important - the room had been booked as a ‚Äòking business room‚Äô, and the receptionist at check-in confirmed this. However, there were actually just two single beds (separately made up as singles) pushed together. I was so distracted by all the modern features of the room (as described above) that I failed to notice until it was too late (i.e. already unpacked etc.) that this was not a king bed!
The lower rating I have given was primarily because of the aircon issue. I mentioned this at check-out, so I hope they looked into it so that the next occupant was not disturbed.

Used the hotel for just that and it couldn't be beat - it's in Terminal 3 and you can take the Air Train to Terminal 1/4 or walk to Terminal 2 (all indoors) within 10 minutes time. Food wise they have restaurants at the hotel, but might as well walk to Terminal 2 or 3 to eat at an airport restaurant. I did - they are reasonably priced.  No need for stairs or anything - rooms start on the 2nd floor and you can just walk across the 2nd floor to get to Terminal 3 and go from there. There are some rooms that face the runway so you can watch takeoffs and landings on the runways unobstructed.

Date of stay: August 2018,MichiganderAbroad,"Disappointing food, but good stay","There's no doubt that this property is unique among airport hotels for actually having a distinct, unique design aesthetic. Both the exterior and interior of this property show a great attention to detail, and create a space that really does make you forget you're in the middle of an international airport. The location is perfect if you've got an early morning or late night flight out of Changi, and I appreciated that I was able to check in relatively early so that I could relax ahead of my 5:45 am flight. The blackout curtains helped me fall asleep and stay asleep, and even though my room was near the SkyTrain tracks, I wasn't disturbed by a lot of ambient noise.

One aspect of my stay that was disappointing was the room service- my food arrived lukewarm, except for my milkshake that was basically melted into a glass of milk with chunks of ice in it- disgusting. I had eaten lunch in one of the many restaurants located in the underground mall below the airport, and wished I had done likewise for dinner after eating at the hotel! Considering that many travelers will likely be too tired to venture out of their rooms for a meal, I thought it was surprising that the in house catering wasn't up to a higher standard.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",155 ,148 ,4.0,

Cons:
- IHG rewards priority check-in desk is frequently not open. I‚Äôm a gold member with IHG and the benefits of membership aren‚Äôt great. Priority check-in is one of the few benefits of gold membership when there are long queues. But I‚Äôve often queued at this hotel.

On our return to Sydney the duty managers did an amazing job of locating the laptop (and cables) and arranging for it to be sent to us. This was way beyond their duty of care and I am deeply grateful for the time and professionalism they put into this process. The hotel is extremely modern and comfortable. The rooms are very well designed and beautifully cool. The pool area is special indeed - like an oasis. We upgraded to get access to the club and it was well worth it. The evening drinks and canapes were amazing - table service and the most tasteful array of cocktails and offerings. Breakfast was an extremely high standard as well. Highly recommended.

On our most recent visit we stayed in a Deluxe Room with Club Lounge privileges. We were pleasantly surprised by how excellent the food was that the Club served in the evening. It really was substantial enough to take the place of a meal. It included meatballs, fish on skewers, salad, soup and fruit. There were several types of desserts available as well, in small portions, but one could help oneself as often as you wished. Being directly connected to the airport was a huge boon and the reason we choose to stay there. After a very substantial buffet breakfast, we walked over to Terminal 2 within 10 min.

The room was rather small and it was a long walk to the further wing where we were put. There is a refrigerator with water and creamer. The oddest thing is that the only window in the room is a big picture window in the bathroom right behind the bathtub. Fortunately, you could lower a black curtain  to prevent from being seen. Decided not to have breakfast at 25 Singapore dollars per person. There are lots of very cheap alternatives in the terminals. We were able to eat at a Star Alliance lounge for free.

Date of stay: July 2018,lileybiczo,Stayed here for just a night--that was too long,"My husband and I stayed at Crowne plaza our last night of traveling before returning back home from our honeymoon. After what we experienced I wished we had just stayed in the airport for our redeye flight.

The hotel itself is beautiful and very clean, also the rooms were very nice. That's where the nice comments stop. At check-in we were told that something was set-up for us in our room in recognition of us being on our honeymoon. We were so touched by the gesture but upon getting to our room there was nothing ""set-up"". About two hours later hotel staff person rang our doorbell and gave us a cake and said nothing else. It was really uncomfortable and awkward. We were on the ninth level and it smelled very unpleasant, like mold and wet towels. In the room there was a free phone they equip guests with that can be used to access internet and even make calls. I thought it was so neat and I wanted to give my sister a call before we landed home and wanted to use the opportunity to use the room phone but mine didn't turn on. I called down and they said someone would be up right away. An hour later they called back and said they were sorry it was taking so long and determined there was something wrong with my phone and so they would send someone up with a new one. My husband and I were tired of waiting and needed to eat and sleep before we got on our redeye and so we decided to eat at the restaurant at the hotel.

We went to the restaurant and no guests were there but they were just opening for dinner service it seems. We were greeted by the hostess and given a table. She then lay down the menus and walked away. Then we were ignored. No asking if we wanted to put in a drink order, nothing. So we walked out and ate somewhere else in the airport.

We had a nice dinner and got back to our room and still there was no follow up or message about the in-room phone.

We got to check-out and it is quite busy. We waited patiently and once we got to the counter we were asked how our stay was and my husband let them know what we had experienced. A manager was called and after waiting ten or so more minutes he comes out to say sorry about our bad experience and that's it. We waited just so he could apologize and waste our time when we had to catch our flight. Nice hotel but the staff and the experiences just left our last honeymoon note on a sour one.

We arrived weary for travelling by air for the previous 3 days and on the day of our arrival we had been up since 5.30am and had 2 flights one of which was a delayed flight so that when we checked in sometime after 8pm we were very tired. The receptionist asked about our flight and on hearing the weary story offered us a magnificent room on the 9th floor and check out at noon.

Date of stay: June 2018,Tim B,A great transit option in Singapore,I usually just stay in the Ambassador Transit Hotel in Changi but decided to try the Crown Plaza this time.  I was a bit worried as I was traveling to and from Terminal 2 and the Crown Plaza is next to Terminal 3 but I should not have worried.  There is an excellent pedestrian tunnel between the terminals and it only takes 5-10 minutes to walk the distance.  Check in was quick and painless and more like a hotel than the transit hotel in the terminal.  I got an upgrade to a suite which was great but not particularly necessary since I was only going to be there for about 7 hours.  The room was fantastic and it was nice to be in a real hotel room with windows.  Check out was also efficient.  A great experience.,Trip type: Travelled on business,"Jakarta, Indonesia",167 ,76 ,5.0,

I booked the room in person on Monday morning, for a Thursday night stay - a twin room with direct access to the swimming pool.  Unfortunately, there was a mix up and no twin room was available, but the staff did their best to accommodate us, by offering either a king bedded room with direct pool access with an additional bed or a suite on another floor, for no extra charge. We chose to stay with the pool access and it was a pretty sizeable room, so it could accommodate the extra bed, even though it was not ideal.  The receptionist arranged a complimentary drink, which was thoughtful. It is a lovely hotel, especially if you have a pool view; Im not sure how I would feel about a view of the runway.  Really good in-house Chinese restaurant also, where we enjoyed a delicious dinner.

Date of stay: June 2018,NekiyC,"Comfortable stay, but a number of defects in the room","My family of 4 had a night's stay here at one of the suites. My wife and I had fond memories of this place because we had our wedding banquet here.

The room was big and the stay was comfortable. Lots of sitting/sleeping, eating and working area. Lots of amenities and eateries too, thanks to Changi Airport having a vibrant retail and f&b scene.

Our main disappointment was that the room seemed to be ill maintained. We chanced upon a number of defects, some fIrly critical. Main door which cannot be locked from the inside; bathroom towel handle bar falling off; TV console cabinet door that cannot close properly hence keep opening (down); power socket casings (at least 2) falling apart, exposing the electrical wiring inside hence we didn't dare to use them for fear of electrical shocks.

When we checked out, the staff asked if the stay was OK. I said briefly there were lots of defects. He replied with a mere ""so sorry about that"" without asking more about where the defects were. This gave me the impression that either such defects are so common that the staff didn't find them surprising, or perhaps defects of the fixtures are not a key priority of the hotel.

We will probably still return to stay at this hotel, but I hope the management do something about the defects and not just ignore them.",Trip type: Travelled with family,,35 ,21 ,,3.0

Singapore Airlines put me up overnight (and the other option was to sleep in the airport). Check in was fast and efficient, but it did take me awhile to figure how to get to the room (elevator not near lobby area). Room was spacious, comfortable bed, large bath/shower, and a view of the traffic entering/leaving the airport (but blinds that could block out sunlight pretty thoroughly).

In the morning, I went down to have breakfast prior to my departure and it was one of the best breakfasts I had my entire trip, especially the local items (I had a great bowl of laksa.) and the fresh fruit.

Date of stay: June 2018,Shah_Rukh_2007,Pure misery,"As his fans know, Shah doesn't like to sweat. And that just what he did ... in copious amounts. Let him explain.

A late check in is nothing unusual for Shah, given his hectic travel pace, running from country to country. This hotel gives him the advantage of being right at the airport. But of late, things have gone downhill here and this latest stay was the last straw.

After arriving late night (11 pm), Shah finds his room to be a sweltering 30 deg C. When he politely (very politely) complained, he was told that 'oh, that is because the AC only comes on when you put the key card in the slot'. No kidding ‚Äî that was the actual answer given. The simple recommendation he made was to ensure that they find a way to keep the rooms at a temperature that is tolerable and yet environmentally friendly. Shah cares about the environment.

This absolutely does not happen at any other hotel in Singapore that Shah has stayed in. If you had your family with you, then you can imagine the outcome ‚Äî kids screaming, wife screaming, and you wondering was the airport convenience really worth it.

And one other thing ‚Äî they have created a 'new' wing called the Jewel wing. It is nothing but a cage, absolutely horrible and claustrophobic. They try to put you in there but hold your ground; insist in a room in the main unit.

Shah Rukh says: Singapore is a tiny place; you can go just about anywhere in a 20 minute drive and taxis at the airport are a plenty. Consider another hotel nearby or in the city. It's better this way.

Shah Rukh's tip: If you absolutely need to stay here, call the hotel and ensure you get a guarantee that you will not be placed in their Jewel Wing and also mentioned that you would like your room to be of a normal temperature when you arrive.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Montreal, Canada",75 ,89 ,1.0,

The hotel is directly accessible from the arrivals area at Terminal 3. After landing, we collected our luggage from the baggage carousel and loaded them onto the airport trolley. We were able to take the trolley into the hotel, check in, and take it right up into our room. Upon leaving the following morning our bags were there on the trolley ready to go back to the departure area. We didn't need to take them off until we went back through immigration again.

There is a green light over the desk, the function of which isn't obvious.  The light switches have blue lights on them, which stay on even when they are in the off position.  I don't understand why room designers go to great lengths to block out light coming  in from the window, and then fill the room with annoying points of light.

They are very apologetic, but the facilities, bathrooms and carpets are either old and dirty, or drenched with water, as they have leaking shower-cabins.   What I also noticed is, that for room and cleaning service, they mostly employ staff from China, no English speaking capabilities. So if you need something to get done - your lost.

They had rooms available but one needs to pay an additional 160 SGD plus taxes on top of the room rate that is already over 250 SGD.  So if you add it all up the cost for one night is equivalent to staying in a very grand, palatial hotel.  There are other hotels around that let one check in early - such as the Park Hotel - they charge $30 SGD to check in early which is reasonable.  I asked for a refund to be able to go and stay elsewhere and check in early however the hotel would not refund the money.

The swimming pool water is also extremely chilly, my daughter started crying the moment I dipped her toes in so we weren't able to enjoy ourselves in the pool at all throughout our stay. There was also shockingly expensive parking charges incurred for our 1 night stay (about SGD$60) as the hotel doesn't give guests complimentary parking so you are subject to Changi Airport's hourly parking rates. The complimentary toiletries provided in our room also felt somewhat cheap so that was another area which I wasn't very impressed by.  It's not all bad with the hotel though.

The suite was enormous with a large separate living area, powder room, entrance way & dressing room. It had direct access to the swimming pool, which we did not get to use as we checked in late and departed early. The bathroom was large & luxurious. Bed was comfortable.

I had difficulty finding power points to charge our electrical devices (only finding one outlet in the desk area of the room). Maybe I missed some international plug outlets, but I looked and looked and could not find them.

Additionally, there was a capsule coffee machine which is a great touch, but there were only decaf capsules provided. Yes I could have rung to get full strength, but I wanted my coffee hit right then! Was not too much of a problem to pop around to the club to get coffee, but I would have preferred it in bed. (First world problems!)

The hotel check in was really fast and friendly and they organised in about 5 minutes flat to have a bed added to the suite for my son - which was very impressive! Check out was equally as quick which was great.

The hotel is a walk, all undercover, from the airport terminals. I was a bit daunted by the prospect of getting there, as I had visions of having to walk with luggage and a 6 year old down sidewalks with cars zooming past, but it was fantasticly easy to get to from the terminal.

People just want to get to their rooms after long flights - they really need to re-think the whole process because it leaves a terrible first impression.

The good news:
Everything else was wonderful and convenient. Last time I was in the Jewel wing, this time got a runway view and it was awesome - great view of the runway and gates, room and bathroom were spotless, spacious, comfortable, modern and well-designed with amenities covering everything you need for an overnight stay.

The club lounge was of great quality, the service was exceptional, and the quality of the food and drinks was excellent too. Definitely worth upgrading to! Spirits are served as well as wine and beer during evening cocktails. From the lounge you look out onto the tropical looking pool area.

The main reception area downstairs was pretty chaotic and could definitely benefit from some reorganisation...you had to be pretty assertive to get to the front, even with a so-called priority check in.

The room was nice and spacious, and overlooked the runway which was fun. The hotel has a very unique design which adds to its charm.

After receiving absolutely no help from the Marina Bay Sands for an extra night ( I don't consider trying to charge over double my current rate per night help ), the decision was made to simply stay close to the airport given the early departure time.

And wow! The Crowne did impress. Fast check in and they even paid for our taxi who had ""a broken card machine"".

The hotel was great about allowing us (2 adults, 1 child) an early check-in (rooms are lovely), and we freshened up before heading into the city for some shopping and lunch near Orchard Road - about a 20-minute taxi ride. When we came back, we felt like we could truly relax. We had a swim in the pool (beware it's not warm!) but it's fun. You can order snacks out there until 6 pm. Food options were good, and despite being next to an airport the room was very well sound insulated.

We live in Holland Village so, when our schedules are super tight, staying at the airport hotel is very convenient specially because the bar always shows the premier league.  This week we called hotel bar and reception 4 times in total to double check if they would be showing the Liverpool game. It is our anniversary but we both have travel early tomorrow and just wanted to chill and watch the match before flying out tomorrow at 6am & 11:30am (consecutively) . So, after confirmation that they would be showing the game, we decided to book a room for our late anniversary celebration. When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the bar twice to double check they were showing the game. Turns out that it gets to 10:52pm (match supposed to be at 11pm) and bar staff let‚Äôs us know that they are no longer subscribed to premier league channels.  When we arrived at 4pm today, all we did was drop our bags off in room, we never used anything... not even a bottle of water!!!! After the distressing news , we are now heading back home. The management said they will refund our room and waive the charges for 4 drinks at the bar. Although everyone was apologetic, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING they can do about to justify whatever poor customer services that caused us so much distress and the fact we are now missing the match that is no meaningful for us, specially being this disappointed on a night that is supposed to be of great celebrations of our anniversary! The bar still comes up in goodie as A sports bar and claim the show the premiere league: please be aware they NO LONGER do!

I could have spent a couple days exploring this amazing airport and the many restaurants and attractions it contains. Knowing how cool the airport was, I booked the last night of my Singapore vacation at the Crowne Plaza and am so glad that I did!  The Crowne Plaza is stunningly modern and beautifully designed. Check-in was relatively fast although it is easy to overlook where the line begins. I had booked the cheapest room, which meant a LONG walk to the Jewel wing. If you want to be close to the lobby, book a room with a pool or runway view. My friend booked a pool view room and it was definitely nicer than the cheaper room I had booked. The room was incredibly cozy and comfortable. The bed is something I could have slept 20 hours in, which was a shame because our flight had an 8:20 am departure the next day. The bathroom was large and had a really cool feature where you could make the door opaque at the flick of a switch so people couldn't see into it. Everything about the hotel and room was modern and well designed for the space. There was a fridge and free bottled water, which was a very nice touch. As I said before, this hotel is literally at Terminal 3 of the airport. Once you step through the hotel doors you do not have to go outside again. There is a nice corridor on the second level that drops you off into Terminal 3, next to the tram that takes you to Terminal 1.  There are so many restaurants and shops to explore before security at the mall that you will not run out of things to do so be sure to spend plenty of time at the hotel.The pool was fantastic and designed, unlike anything I had seen.  There were planters in the middle of it that made for tiny little alcoves for relaxing.  I would have loved it as a kid!  As an adult, what I liked was seeing planes take off from the pool.  Plane after plane took off across the street but within view of the pool.  That in and of itself was awesome for a plane spotter like myself. I wish I had a second night at this hotel so I could have explored more of the hotel and adjacent airport. I did have a chance to go to the bar after I was given a free drink voucher.  The bar was awesome and the restaurant also looked really good.  Overall, a great experience at the Crowne Plaza Changi airport. I would definitely stay here again.

It was really convenient because it is located inside the the airport.The bed was nice and comfortable.  They had a rainfall shower was really nice after a long flight. The internet was kind of slow but no worse than any other hotel. Two big things happened that were problematic.  The first was addressed by the hotel staff after I left a review on the IHG website.  That issue was that it was hard to find the entrance to the hotel from the airport. I couldn't find any signs directing me to the hotel.  I eventually found it after asking a couple of people where it was and being told to take the train to terminal 3.  A member of the management team reached out to me about this issue and they are going to be working with the airport to get better signage in terminal one where I landed. This is an awesome example of a hotel going above and beyond to take care of guest concerns.  The second problem was the air conditioning (or the lack thereof). In the lobby and all common areas of the hotel it was super hot! Like unbearably hot and humid.  I can only assume that they were having a temporary A/C issue because I cannot fathom that IHG would be ok with one of their hotels being a super uncomfortable temperature.  I will note that the air conditioning in my room worked just fine once I turned it on. I will be staying at the Changi Crowne Plaza again in a week and I will update this review to reflect on the A/C issue. Other than those two things my stay was wonderful.  I was offered a complimentary drink at check in which was a really nice gesture after a long flight.  The hotel staff that I interacted with were all very friendly.

There are cheaper options off airport but since we were arriving so late I chose to pay the premium for this hotel. In my view it was worth the money.

We arrived at 2 am, put our luggage on a trolly and headed through customs. Once in the airport we asked for directions to the hotel. Everyone we asked were helpful. Soon we picked up signs for the hotel.

The very gracious host at the desk offered us a late checkout (2 pm) with out hesitation. As we spoke more about how our next flight was not until 8 pm she added another complimentary hour. This was a huge blessing.

We rolled the trolly into the elevator and up to our room which was large, modern and very clean. Our room faced away from the runways so we heard no airport noise. The bed was comfortable. There were bedside charging stations so all you need is your usb or Apple cord.

The bathroom was large and included a large walk in shower. There was also a huge soaking tub that we did not use. There was a nice selection of toiletries. There was also a 110 volt electric shaver outlet in the bathroom and a hairdryer.

There was complimentary bottled water, coffee machine and iron and ironing board. We paid for the buffet breakfast which was worth the $11 US per person it added to our room reservation. The selection included American/European selections and lot of asian options too.

We never did turn on the TV so can't comment on the election or reception. When it was time to depart we simply rolled our luggage trolly back down to the lobby. Checked out quickly and headed to the terminal.

It is a long walk from the point of disembarking, through customs, and further to the hotel. The check was quick, and then another walk to the room. It appeared to be a very big hotel.

The room is 5 star, and had everything that I could possibly want. Even a electric black-out blind. Very good shower and bed appreciated after a long flight. The breakfast buffet was also very good.

We stayed for one night and even though we were not staying the next day, they held our luggage the whole day. The room is not that spacious but the bathroom is divided by glasses, that makes it look clean and relaxing. I was amazed by the effect of the glasses. If you want some privacy in the bathroom you can just block the glasses transparency.  The service is outstanding. I would definetly go back. Good job! The reason I didn't give 5 star is because they didn't tell you before that you can go thru the terminal. Beware of the taxi drivers.

It must be noted that the hotel in located in Terminal 3, so depending on your flights arrival you may have to catch the sky train.  Check in was done quickly. Staff were kind enough to extend my check out by 2 hours, after signing up for the loyalty program. Works for me. Rooms are a bit of a walk from the main lobby (depending on your room allocation). Attention to detail is on point.  They also provide you with a handy phone in each room which you can take around you in the city. This is a huge plus point. Additionally, they provide free international calls to selected countries via this phone.  Breakfast was like any other five star buffet.

The main disadvantage in our opinion is the fact that you leave the secured area of the airport and find your way to the facility that may require long walks and transit between terminals. The hotel missed out on my top ranking for 2 reasons. First the failure of reception to point out that we were in the second building requiring even more walking. We discovered the matter when the elevator would not acknowledge our key card!

While the staff were flexible and provided an early check-in it was still four hours after our arrival at 8:00 am.

Kids were grumpy (so were we) just wanted a swim, dinner and sleep. But check-in was horrendous. Not a really huge queue. But was inexplicably just really slow and clearly understaffed... Took 45 mins, just standing there. An American guy was going spare because the VIP queue was slower than ours... All a bit tense. And all because only two people only on duty. It was only 6pm not 4 in the morning...

The poor staff were trying but it was extremely slow. Bearing in mind the room cost, just not acceptable. Then we went to get in the lift, card didn't work. Ran back to get another but they just said it was the lift and swiped us up. Got all way round - had to be the farthest room which normally wouldn't bother us - but again, the key didn't work. The poor bellhop turned up and bless him ran back down to get another one.

The check in area could be redesigned to be a bit more spacious with a structural column right in the way of where the current queue runs.

The rooms are clean and while not being spacious are certainly not cramped. The service was excellent bringing me up a toothbrush within minutes of requesting one. The pool is large clean and quite shallow with garden bed islands making for a fun time for the kids. Jet engine noise can be heard by the pool but is not overbearing by any means. Our rooms looked directly onto the runway which entertained the kids greatly. Despite this there was virtually no engine noise audible in the room and we had a great night‚Äôs sleep.

The hotel is connected to Changi airport and is very easy to find. I was a little worried that the noise of the planes would disturb me, but the sound proofing in the room was excellent.

The hotel room was pleasant and the bed was extremely comfortable. Thanks to the black out blinds and the comfortable bed I managed to get a good sleep and refresh after my journey.

I tried eating In both the hotel bar and the restaurant. I would recommend choosing to eat in the bar though as I found the quality of food to be far superior to the buffet in the restaurant. I was actually a little disappointed with the quality and selection of food in the restaurant buffet, and considering you are paying $56 I would avoid it in favour of the other menu.
The bar staff were excellent. Raymond and Habib were very welcoming and extremely helpful. They were knowledgable about Singapore and more than willing to advice on transport and where to go.

I would recommend staying at the Crowne Plaza. The hotel is ideal for the airport. Not really anything close by though as it's in the airport complex so you need to take public transport.

As the offer I booked had no breakfast, I was given an option to add breakfast for an additional S$25++ per night (if I recall correctly). Since there are plenty of local and international options at the airport's Terminal 3 building, I think this addition can be given a miss.

For a hotel that's almost a decade old, the room has been well maintained. Both the bed and pillows were of a good quality, and I've had a good sleep during my stay. Guests who are sensitive to noise would best avoid this hotel, as you can hear planes taking off or landing.

While the internet speed was at a reasonable 7.5mpbs download/upload speed, it would have been nice if they could offer a payable high-speed option. I had no issues with the connection or its stability, despite connecting multiple devices.

TV channel options could be better, with more regional and international offerings, as compared to the English-centric options. As for radio, I recall seeing only one option.

The runway view rooms are from the 6th floor upwards. Go for those ending with -12 (eg: 612/712 etc) since it has the best view of the runway. Not only that, it's also a corner room too.

Checking out was a breeze since I had prepaid for the rooms, but I wasn't getting the love from front desk. At many hotels the staff would encourage you to return, but not this one. A thank you with a smile, and off you go.

Will I return? Yes. But training staff to handle guests with more passion and genuine warmth would leave a far better and memorable impression.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Singapore, Singapore",25 ,44 ,4.0,

The lounge access was a nice perk, I arrived in time for drinks and snacks.  The bar was well stocked led, and the snacks were ample.  The attendants were friendly and professional.  Breakfast was the same, good portions, and well staffed.  I arrived late in the afternoon, and had an early flight out, so I did not get to use the pool or the gym.

Check in was fast, friendly and extremely helpful. The porters are wonderful also.

My room was overlooking the lovely swimming pool on a high floor.

The rooms are extremely well appointed and lacked nothing. Pleasantly surprised to find complimentary bottled water in the bathroom. The bathroom also had an excellent array of high quality toiletries and sundries in case the busy traveller forgot to pack anything.

The free wifi is fast and efficient.

Plenty of choice for places to eat here also and not overpriced either.

The only thing that did disappoint is that the hotel's windows are not adequately soundproofed - I could hear the high volume aircraft noise, but did not disturb my one night of sleep.

I chose not to take advantage of the lovely outdoor pool because of the humidity and the noise from the busy road and noise from the planes.

We were there early, and it was if everything was prepared the night before and kept in the refrigerator overnight, and just pulled out and put under the warming lights without heating the food.

This hotel is perfect for that! Not a stair between the arrivals hall and the reception and we were in the pool within 15 minutes of clearing customs.

Beautiful hotel. You can hear the airport when you are outside and feel the Singapore heat, but in the rooms it's quiet and beautifully appointed. As club members we were upgraded to a fantastic suite overlooking the pool and treated to club lounge access.

The (third party operated) spa is very overpriced, so we headed into Singapore instead for a few hours. The club lounge staff were brilliant - especially Mustafa in the evening and the egg chef from Hong Kong and her lounge partner - hey offered exceptionally friendly service with great information on where to go and how to get their - above and beyond with print outs and directions.

Shame the pool closes at 8pm due to darkness causing safety concerns - hope they fix that as the rooms are all double glazed so there was no pool noise at all.

When checked with the front desk about a room with a window, we were told that none of the rooms have any windows due to airport security and since the hotel is located at the airport terminal it cannot have any windows. When we tired to sleep, were bitten multiple times by small mosquitoes that were flying in the room, were on our pillow and in the bathroom.

Be warned though, you'd have to gather up your own luggage and bring it to your room. Not too fussed by this really. More exercise I say :) Room was fit for purpose, clean, comfy beds, and had a good view of the pools.  I also asked for late checkout on booking and got encouraged by reception to sign up with IHG. I did so, and used the perks as soon as possible. Good decision I think.  I'd recommend this hotel mainly for it's location. And if you plan to venture out into the city, the MRT is close by.

We didn't check in until ~10.30pm as our flight was delayed and had to check out by 7.30am the following day to catch our connecting flight.  Given that we were just at the hotel to sleep, we disappointed with the room we were allocated which was room 322. Just outside the room was a ramp for cars to drive into a parking lot and to another road. The entire night all we could hear was two distinctive ""thud thud"" as each vehicle's front and rear wheels hit a strip on the road.

My room was as expected of a Crowne Plaza - clean, very pleasant and everything working.  I was a little stunned at first to see that the bathroom overlooked and was overlooked by the outside world, which for my room was some building work, until I found the two electric separate blinds that provided the privacy.  I took a rather late dinner in the Azure restaurant which was haute cuisine buffet with the Asian touch, it cost me 45 SGD for the privilege of going back for seconds.  I was very impressed with the lounge on the ground floor where I took breakfast and lunch.  The attention to detail was impressive for a holidaymaker - a pastry and perfect (for my taste) coffee was just over 11 SGD.  I was though rather disappointed in my Ceaser salad at lunch time, it wasn't the best I have eaten and for myself I should have chosen the starter version; that and a coffee cost me 20 SGD.

Rooms are pretty big (30m2), fully equipped (air conditioning, bath tub, rainforest shower, toothbrush, tea kettle, smartphone, etc.) and super silent. I could not hear a single plane take-off or land with the bathroom doors closed. Pool and gym area are very nicely designed, as well. Pricing is relatively high (includ. room service menu, spa treatments, etc.), but on the same scale with other 5 star hotels in Singapore. However, you get to be well-rested before your connecting flight the next day, which indeed is priceless. ",,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",294 ,52 ,,5.0

Check in was quick and you can put your luggage on the airport trolley and bring it right in. They will return the trolley to the airport for you. Room was comfortable and had a nice bathroom with a separate shower and tub. We had a great sleep and then had a wonderful buffet breakfast. We would definitely stay here again.

I am sure that at a different time and under different circumstances I would be able to write a positive review for this hotel. However, for us, things were not good during this stay. We were allocated room 418, a fairly standard room overlooking the airport road and railway link. Rooms 401 to 407 were being renovated so every time we passed there was either dust, noise or fumes. The workers wore masks when they were varnishing the door frames but guests on this corridor just had to put up with it. The workers were polite enough but the hotel should really have closed this corridor while the work was completed. Worse was to come when we returned from a hot, sticky day visiting Gardens by the bay. A note in the room said that there was no hot water until 7pm. We went for an early meal, having had a quick wash in cold water. When we arrived back at 9 pm there was still no hot water. Having gone to reception to find out what was happening I was told the hot water would not be back on until 4am. Not good for anyone. Management did offer a change of room to a higher floor, at this time, but being tired we did not want to pack up again only to have to unpack in another room. As rewards club members, we were offered extra points for the inconvenience but this situation should have been dealt with much better, much earlier.
On the positive side, there is a lovely swimming pool and there are nice rooms on higher floors that overlook the pool. The position of the hotel is good for airport users and has a MRT station on the doorstep. Breakfast was quite good and the staff were friendly.

Hotel is conveniently located in the airport and you could walk straight to T3 departure hall. The room is spacious, but we found the bath not working ?) so we had to use the shower instead. The shower floor was way too slippery and my poor 1.5 yo old boy slipped and fell headfirst while walking into the shower when daddy was running the water to a warm temperature. That was such a heartbreak but thankfully he was ok. We found it a disappointment that we were not greeted when arriving at the lobby and despite us having lots of luggage, we were not offered assistance with our luggages (no one was available to greet us?)  and we had to request for a porter service from the reception. Our request for a crib during check-in was not actioned on until a few hours later when we requested for the 2nd time.

The hotel is spacious, modern, clean, and quiet. But the location is the number one selling point.

Date of stay: January 2017,Singapore1704,Disappointing and overpriced,"My wife checked us in for a weekend birthday staycation getaway, which was really sweet.

We loved the expansive view of the airport runway.

But as we stayed on, we encountered one shortcoming after another.

We appreciate that the hotel is meant for air Travellers who need a quick transit.

However, the hotel would invariably also attract Singapore residents looking for a quick staycation.

We were disappointed that the hotel did not provide for complimentary or even discounted parking at Changi Airport. The daily parking at Changi Airport was in excess of S$50! Do the Maths. If you stay 2 nights and drive, you could pay more than S$100 in carpark charges.

Turning to basic amenities, it was disappointing that the channel selections for the inhouse TV was very limited. And for Soccer lovers, you will NOT get English Premier league matches.

And even if you did, the TV was demonic, and switched off by itself after a few minutes.

Another basic amenity was food, and this is where the hotel was lacking. We had room service (a bowl of local noodles and a burger), with 2 glasses of juice. The bill came up to more than S$100. But more fundamentally, the taste and quality of the food was disappointing. The noodles was bland. The burger was overdone and tough. The juice tasted like it was made from cut fruits that were not fresh. So you pay a lot of money for mediocre food.

And to top things off, the hotel was ""proactive"" enough to send a staff to essentially barge into your room at 1145 (just before the checkout time) - they won't even wait for you to open the door - and to remind you to leave.

But when the front desk called I only told him to let my friend place his baggage on the concierge and I will collect it when I check in, without my permission the front desks allowed him to check in when there is no update that my room has been checked in by other parties.  The miscommunication caused me to cancel an important business meeting.  I had to personally come down to collect my room card from my friend and messed up his schedule for the day too.  Worse of all, the front desk called my friend to pay a deposit under his name when the room is supposed to be under mine.

Date of stay: December 2016,Dreamsong,Not our best stay here...,"This is our fourth stopover and stay at Crowne Changi. Check in was on the dry side, no pleasantries. I requested a quiet room away from the elevator in their 'quiet zone'. It seemed a good spot albeit overlooking a construction site. Come 9pm though there was this annoying knocking, door opening and closing sound every few minutes or so. We thought we worked it out to be housekeeping but it continued throughout the night. Just when I was in a deep sleep, I'd be snapped out of it by a banging door closing type sound - so much for a quiet zone. During our stay we visited the Lobby Lounge; it was deserted when we arrived but quickly filled up with people. It took 20 minutes for a glass of wine and a beer (not kidding). Two of our 3 meals arrived, but one was delayed leaving the third person to eat on their own. There was only one staff member in attendance; they needed a second attendant. We would have ordered another round of drinks but didn't want to wait another 20 minutes. This was lost revenue for the hotel we thought. The pool, as always, is a real treat. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equiped. Room service was prompt and well presented (supper meals).

Thinking that we have paid $500+ for a 2 nights stay, it will not be a problem for us to get a complimentary car park coupon as we parked our car there for 2 nights. The hotel explained that the car park belongs to Changi airport and they are not in control of the carpark therefore, unable to provide complimentary carpark coupon. However, as hotel guest, we think that the hotel should be spending a little cost on such services for their guests, probably getting bulk purchase of carpark coupon from Changi airport",,"Singapore, Singapore",10 ,9 ,,3.0

Before the hotel was constructed, the nearest hotel was the Meridien, now the Village Hotel, Changi, about 15 or more minutes away by coach ‚Äì a coach that runs only every 90 minutes.  The Crowne Plaza has made transit, or even late-night arrivals so much easier.But ease of access from the airport is the primary redeeming feature of the hotel.  The lobby/reception area is dark and uninviting, almost feels as if the hotel is closed.  The overall design of the hotel was not well-considered: When coming from the airport with heavy luggage, the hotel entrance is on the second floor, which also has the hotel bar and restaurant. But the check-in desks, that is, the reception are on the first floor, street level.  As for the room, it‚Äôs quite decent but in need of work.  The bathroom mirror was pealing, several outlets at the desk didn‚Äôt work (one was even physically damaged), and the closet sliding door hit the door covering the refrigerator, so guests have to use a foot to push in the refrigerator door in order to open the closet sliding door.  The room is over-packed with furniture, including a large round table just in front of the foot of the bed: It‚Äôs a danger if one has to get up in the night to go to the bathroom.  And there were very limited amenities, not even a shower cap.  For two consecutive years, the hotel has won, they say, Skytrax award for best airport hotel in the world.  I probably take 50 flights a year, maybe more, and cannot imagine how it won the award.

Check in (even at 0700) was welcoming, swift and efficient, and I was in my room and unpacking by 8am. I had breakfast downstairs straight away, having not eaten the flight breakfast offered, and there was a large array of western and asian choices in the buffet. An omelette quickly cooked at the ""egg point"" was delicious and done exactly as I asked !
The rooms in this hotel are excellent and large enough to completely stretch out and relax in. I have always liked the couch arrangement in front of the TV as a better place to sit comfortably than watching from the bed. Speaking of which, the king size bed was extremely comfortable with its mattress topper, and even though daytime I managed a good sleep after the long flight from Amsterdam.
Contrary to some reviewers, I do not find the walk to the room from the lift - under cover but in open-air environment - at all uncomfortable, and it gives me always a realistic sense of the day's weather.

Because of unwanted staying one night at the hotel, I found there are many excellent restaurants at the airport. 1/The Chineses restaurant with special duck dishes is a very good one (duck is highly recommended) - see a picture near the restaurant - YOU MUST GO UP THE ESCALATOR. 2/ The Thai Express, there is also a PORK specialty. Try this out. 3/ There's another Dim Sum restaurant with a hot soup noodle recommended.
You can go to level B2 for food court with cheap meals. There are tons of choices for you. I found that they do not take credit card and I don't like so I often eat at the restaurant near the hotel.
I found unsatisfied with the reception check in service. There was a new girl to check me in and she did not know much of her service, and she waited for her colleague to help her and I had to wait. Besides, when I took a long way to go to my room (believe me it's a long way!), the key didn't work, so I had to go back and asked her again. I was so tired with my trip, so I had to downgrade the 5-star hotel with its service.

Date of stay: September 2016,happy2bealive,Excellent airport hotel,"My husband and I booked this hotel as we had an early morning flight to Honolulu via Narita the next morning.

To cut a long story short, I was charged an exorbitant amount for a King Deluxe through the IHG website. Desmond, Duty Manager made good our pre-paid early bird rate by upgrading us to a Club Room. At check-in, Nissa Rashid upgraded us again to a King Club Suite as it was our Anniversary. Really decent of them both and huge thanks!

Really enjoyed our Suite 738, the amenities and the Club Lounge facilities. My husband and I just wanted to chill and we did not want to venture into the busy Terminal area for food. So the Lounge service was perfect for our needs. Matthew was wonderful to chat with and breakfast the next morning was a whole lot better than at the JAL Lounge and even our inflight Kaiseki service.

Staff were all extremely professional and friendly. At check-out, Ben from Bell Service came with two luggage trolleys for our six bags. A short train shuttle ride and we were in Terminal One.

Positives: clean, well equipped modern rooms. Very handy location when transiting. Amazing breakfast buffet. Our room that overlooked the pool had a lovely outlook. Pool looked inviting but we didn't have a chance to use it.

Negatives: reservation process - we had so many issues for a very straightforward booking of two rooms for one night. The amount of emails and phone calls we had to make for them to get it right was ridiculous. Did not give us a good feeling prior to the stay. Then At checkin, of course we weren't given what we'd requested 6 Months earlier on booking (quiet rooms - hotel was by no means full so it should not have been a problem. Eventually got moved but not something you want tot deal with after a long flight!!!!). Finally, the cost is quite high for what you get. Yes, it's convenient, but with all the hassles we had, we could have caught a taxi to another nearby hotel and checked in in the same amount of time, for much less money.

It is not marked on the Singapore Airport map and there are no signs until you are about to enter the hotel.
However when we arrived in the hotel the service was wonderful. We had booked a King room and upgraded to a Club room which was new, well designed, and spacious. On check-in they suggested we might have time to go to the Club Lounge for a drink or two. We quickly cleaned up after our flight from Australia, and the staff were waiting for us and (I suspect) stayed open and extra half hour to allow us time to have a couple of relaxing drinks. Good after a longish flight.
There was a comfortable bed, loads of hanging and storage space in the room, a VERY large desk and a comfortable leather lounge. There were 2 TVs and a toilet and washroom close to the entry as well as the large bathroom and toilet area. My wife loved the large bath. The only (unusual) issue was there was lots of hot water and very little cold water pressure, which meant the bath took a long time to fill at a temperature you could sit in, and the shower could only be used at a low flow to avoid scalding oneself. Maybe this is a teething problem for a new hotel.
The breakfast in the Club lounge was a small but adequate buffet, and the staff were there offering to cook extra items that you may want from an extensive menu.
A lot of good training in customer service has been undertaken by the management and the results show positively. All staff we encountered went beyond their duty to be helpful. Even the small things went so well. When I was waiting to get the elevator in the foyer one time, the doors behind me opened while I was looking at the other side of the bank of lifts. A cleaning lady ‚Äì complete with bucket and mop ‚Äì and I would guess speaking poor English, called out ‚ÄúSir, Sir‚Äù to draw my attention to the available elevator.

I know they just built a new portion of the hotel but the rates were just a little high... something management should review.I'm an IHG Platinum and was welcomed to the elite desk upon arrival.  Checkin agent was really friendly and helpful.  I was given a drink voucher which was nice.As other reviewers have mentioned, most of the hallways are open air and so pretty warm.  The elevators are also hot inside - not sure if they just don't get enough fresh air or what ... perhaps they could be programmed to come to the first floor and open their doors to get some cool air in them from the lobby.That said upon arrival to my room I liked it.  Simple, and small but I liked it.I had requested a runway view since I'm a bit of an airplane nut.  I really enjoyed seeing the airplanes come and go.I did go to the bar to enjoy my drink.  As others have said, you've given a small book with a page showing the options.  I selected the Tiger beer expecting a pint glass like everyone else in the bar seemed to have.  Instead it was a tiny flute of beer ... probably 8 oz or less.  That seemed a little cheap to me.I did go down to the spa and decided to get a massage.  Wasn't impressed.  The woman working on my massage tried to upsell me about 5 times DURING THE MASSAGE for all sorts of things.  It really took away from the calming affect of the massage.  I know the massage place isn't owned by the hotel - so probably I should be reviewing that separately but just beware.  I'd find somewhere else for a massage if I was there again.I wanted to discuss it at checkout, but the agent processed me and was done so quickly I didn't even get to mention it.I'd probably stay here again if the cost was more appropriate.Finally - don't spend on the hotels restaurants - just walk back into the terminal, and go to the basement, there is a large food court of Singaporean food which tastes GREAT and its CHEAP.

The room was well insulated from the airport noise and was basically ok but there were several defects that detracted from our experience, the shower door wouldn't close the hinges were stiff and stayed open by about 300 mm. I guess we'd come from a far nicer hotel the Fairmont in Bejing which raised our expectations and we've stayed at some very nice places in Singapore over the years.

The worst part for us was there was a clear stain on the sheets that could have been washed but we weren't sure and there were marks on the sheets that were definitely after the last wash no way of knowing if they were made on the bed or by being carelessly handled before being placed on the bed.

We will not stay there again it may be a one off but whoever made the bed would have had to see the marks and stain when making the bed so either the sheets were not changed or the quality control is wanting.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",52 ,7 ,2.0,

After weighing all of my options, the best plan was to make a day trip to Sepang to see the race as flights were cheap (about $85 r/t) and hotels were sold out in Sepang.

Staff are so good and willing to help with any request. The hotel is literally in terminal 3 of the airport. You don't even need to walk outside. We had a small issue with some maintenance noise from the room  next to us. We called them and they stopped the noise straight away. The following day they moved us to a new room which was double the size. They were so apologetic which is a nice feeling. When we checked out the next morning the manager came out to see us and presented a thank you card with chocolates for our patience. This is such a nice way to do business.

Yes, it may be a bit dimly lit when you arrive at night, because of the reliance on natural light during the day, but it's well insulated from the airport noise and the staff are on the ball.

You save on taxis and time to get anywhere else..when you transit..this is the most convenient place..so close to the checkin in Treminal three...the customs area , yes you have to clear it, but quiet and easy to do in no time, then collect luggage and take it on trolleys right to reception at the hotel. Go for the buffet breakfast, fabulous...and join the club for free drinks and room rates. I joined and was given an upgrade for free to a runway view..with bathtub...the soaps..French milled and an Illy espresso machine..etc..etc...so relaxing...go out a way and the local cafes in terminal three do Singapore specialties like roast duck..but lunchtime is less busy tah. The dinner crowds, when the sushi restaurant  is packed out. A tip..check your bags in for your ongoing travel up to 48 hours beforehand...right outside the hotel..which gives you time to catch an early buffet, express checkout and still have time to brouse duty free on your way to the gate for boarding.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Hanoi,92 ,33 ,5.0,

Check in was very efficient and due to my IHG Platinum status I was given vouchers for 2 glasses of wine and as it was my wife's birthday in the previous week she was given quite a large birthday cake.
The room was contemporary and very comfortable with separate bath and large shower in the bathroom. There were plenty of amenities including toothbrushes and toothpaste etc., tea and coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers.
Surprisingly there was little airport noise in the room. We used our drinks vouchers in the sports bar, had an early night and checked out at around 8am taking breakfast in the DNATA lounge airside (although at check in the previous evening breakfast was offered in the hotel restaurant for a small supplement).",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Abergavenny, United Kingdom",155 ,175 ,5.0,

Good decision!
The hotel is co-located at the airport and so it is only a short walk to reception.
We had a Club Lounge room - roomy, modern and quiet.
Facilities in the hotel are excellent and the location - literally 5 minutes from the terminal - all added up to a welcome and comfortable break on our flight to Heathrow.
Our only other comment would be to perhaps not stay in the Club Lounge. The cost does not represent value - and the Lounge itself was small and poorly equipped.
However do include breakfast - it was good value.
The airport facilities offer a good alternative for a one night stopover.

Service was great, the room was really nice!!   The food in their restaurant was subpar, ordered a medium rare steak but both times it came out medium. The lobby lounge's kitchen is actually Azur's kitchen so don't be confused. It's the same.  However when I check-in, I realised that my room still had wedding stickers from I'm not sure when but I don't think I paid for a suite to have that sticker there on my window. It kind of spoiled the vibe and the whole experience.  Other than that, whether you're local or tourist they have a newly built wing that I'm looking forward to stay in!    ",,Singapore,57 ,16 ,4.0,

Date of stay: July 2016,TerryMinuit,Time for refurbishment and reinvigoration of the staff.,"We've stayed here once before and its biggest draw is that you can walk through the terminal at Changi and wheel your bags right up to reception. Check-in is quick. But the rooms are showing signs of wear and tear, though clean and everything worked.

Breakfast was fairly good but the staff seemed uninterested and tired. We had to wait for a table despite it being quiet, we then had to wait for the table to be set, then had to wait ages for tea and coffee. The quality of the food was pretty good.

The gym was fine but the pool area has lost its initial charm just after the hotel opened a few years ago. The Jacuzzi areas do not work and there were no towels (despite asking several times for them).

Finally, there is no changing area if you have a late flight and want to freshen up before the flight. The showers and toilets by the pool are not air-conditioned so you change out of the clothes you've been in all day and into nice fresh clothes to then enjoy the humidity and wonder why you bothered changing.

The hotel looks very stylish and has great design points and the staff are friendly but just a bit bored.

Double check where your room will be located as we bizarrely ended up in a room where we could hear some early morning take-offs. All a bit odd for an airport hotel.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",164 ,137 ,3.0,
Date of stay: August 2016,PareshR,Disappointing and a waste of your money !,"Stayed there for a few hours on transit. The experience was a serious let down.Buffet breakfast is till 1030 am . We reached at 10 am so front office told us that we can't eat the buffet as they have already started winding up. ( that was weird) We had to order in room and the same breakfast which cost us $22 costed us $30. The most disappointing thing was the portion size and taste of the breakfast after paying that amount of money per adult.
The room itself was average but the common areas like lobby and lifts are a let down.
Customer service was non existent. Both checkin and checkout took long time. Ordering food/ contacting guest service took 15-20 mins as phone kept ringing an went unanswered.
I finally settled the bill and the hotel offered an extremely high exchange rate.
My verdict: they are out there to make a quick buck and maximise the transit passenger. The model is to maximise your spend and give zero customer service. Avoid this hotel at all costs",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Mumbai, India",31 ,25 ,1.0,

Beds were comfortable for the night but a mattress topper would take the comfort factor to another level.  Large range of dining options downstairs and at airport terminal all of which were very short walk from hotel room.  We prefer to stay here opposed to staying in the airport itself.

The room was wonderful, the service impeccable and the staff was perfect.  The only thing I may do if I return is pass on the breakfast and go the the mall underneath the building and have breakfast there. Yes, it's a bit of a walk, but you can mingle with the residents of Singapore and have a wide variety of menus and save a bit of cash. Although i must say the Crowne Plaza breakfast was GREAT!

Was there a massive change in cooking staff? Silly me still tried it and discovered it was tasteless and luke warm at best. Onto the congee.... it was also luke warm.

Date of stay: April 2016,stylusmaestro,Nice room. Nice pool. Poor accomodation.,"To acquire Skytrax's Best Airport Hotel award means a lot. However it remains to be seen if that was justifiable.

My fourth visit to Crowne Plaza Changi was greeted by none other by me assisting my wife opening the heavy glass door at their main vehicle drop-off lobby as there were no hotel personnels to be seen to assist with baggage or welcome gestures.

Moving forward, we checked-in and requested for our roll-away bed brought in soon for our child but that did not happen after an approximate wait. We decided to vacate and head for our late lunch. Spoke to one employee taking care of a service kiosk located at the main facade and updated them of our bed request and that we would want no staffs entering our room for the purpose of sending the bed while we were away. That was not complied as we discovered a single roll-away bed stationed in our room on our return. Where was the integrity here?

So. We eventually checked out the next day and settled our bill. However, i realised my credit card transaction was a tad amiss. It is a norm for one to be charged for a deposit when booking online but to have a further deduction for a night stay when i was checking out? That was a no brainer. I spent $800+ for a night stay in one of their premier room which cost $315++. What ticjed me off was the fact that their female receptionist was clueless on how much i was charged for the deposit. She assumed the standard rate for deposit as being between $100 - $150. I pressed on as it does not seems right and discovered $450 was charged instead. Appalling.

Here's what happen.

1.Our arrival was not greeted... fine.. their not 5 star hotel so my expectation was not there. But, while waiting in line for checking in, I spotted a Caucasian couple coming out of a taxi and guess what? The bell boy ran to their rescue to assist their bags and help to check in the bags up to their room.

2. My husband had requested for an extra bed and a cake to celebrate our daughter's bday but I wanted the cake to be delivered a little later as we need to run an errand. And for the extra bed, the concierge lady said that they are able to send it immediately. so we went up with our own luggage to our room. waited for half an hour, but no bed. So we went down to the concierge again and told her, we need to leave, so please deliver the bed later. They wanted to deliver the bed while we are away, I declined but, when we arrive back, the bed is there in our room!

3. Before going back to the room, we approached the concierge to deliver the bed and cake now. the concierge do not have the slightest idea that a bed was already delivered to our room. Communications fail. When we are in the room with our extra bed, we thought that the bell ring was for the cake. Guess what? Another bed! OMG.
We had to wait for another half an hour for the cake, called to remind them even.

4. Checking out was the usual. we didn't find anything a miss. the service was bland, not friendly at all. Until 2 days later, where my husband notice that they have deducted our room charge and hold another additional $450! How did we know? We called the hotel and insisting to tell us exactly how much they have hold. The girl on the phone at first insisted that the hold was only $150 to $200. No definite answer. After insisting to speak to the manager, she has confirmed that Crowne Plaza Hotel has taken additional $450 and will only release 14days later. and then she corrected that they have release it the day we checked out.

5. For breakfast, again I noticed a bias in your service. We were told by the hostess to take a seat at a table which was still being cleared and reset. when there were other tables, fine. When a Caucasian couple came in, they were seated at one of the seats I spotted earlier. and was asked, any coffee or tea for you. Why the different kind of service?

I would like to add on the booking process too:
24th March, my husband made a phone booking for a confirmed room facing the runway. the phone booking was a breeze.
the next morning, (day we are suppose to check in) someone called my husband to inform that there's no more room facing the runway. I was not happy definitely , so after checking again, the room we wanted will only be available after 5..30pm. fine, will take it. so we have made the necessary change of itinerary. at noon, another person called my husband to inform us that the room is ready. Can you imagine the hassle we have to go through to change our itinerary again with 2 kids in tow?

Date of stay: March 2016,09catlover,Awkward service and a damaged room,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza on March 14, 2016 in room 643. My mother joined as well after her flight arrived.

When I walked into the lobby at about nine in the evening, I was not greeted and no one offered to open a door.

The first thing I noticed was how hot and humid the hotel was. It wasn't just ""Singapore warm."" I have lived here quite some time. The air conditioning was simply not on. It was uncomfortable and I noticed it the next day on check out as well.

The receptionist was named FEIZUR. She watched me walk up to the counter, and I smiled and said hello. Her response was a whispered ""Yes?"" It was as if she were afraid to speak. Her eyes were wide and her voice as soft as a whisper. It is awkward to address a guest approaching the counter with the word ""Yes."" Perhaps something along the lines of, ""Welcome to Crowne Plaza, how may we assist you this evening?"" would be the bottom-level expectation for a hotel like this.

I happily informed her I had a reservation. She whispered and looked at me. During the entirety of our interaction, she never spoke above a whisper. The lobby was dead silent, and I leaned in as closely as I could to hear her. She seems like a very nice person who simply needs remedial hospitality training and a lot of confidence.

She handed me a blank white keycard and gestured that the elevator was behind her. She did not inform me of the kind of room I had, whether anyone would help me with my bags, where my room was, what it was like, what kind of amenities I could enjoy, or the location of anything else on the property. She simply checked me in and hoped I would rest well. Please retrain FEIZUR.

The elevator was quite confusing. I walked in and pressed a button and waited. The elevator did not have any air conditioning. ***This is a 5-star hotel without air conditioned elevators***. It did not move, and it was warm and smelled strange, like moist metal. I went out and tried a different elevator. Nothing happened, and it was very warm as well. I then read a note that requested I swipe my card to get the elevator to move. No one bothered to tell me, like, cough, the reception.

I saw dozens of rooms that opened to the outdoors, which I found interesting. My room was cool and clean. The view was of greenery and lovely trees. The sheets and towels were all nicely organized and smelled fine. The bath tub was lovely to enjoy, and the water got very hot when turned up fully. This was the best part of the stay - hot water.

The snacks, including a can of Pringles crisps, were on horrid display. 5-star hotels offering Pringles - not to mention, the plastic cap was missing. I took pictures of this petty joke the hotel is playing on its guests.

The sliding glass mirror at the entrance of the room was almost destroyed along the top. It, and an interior wooden piece, were broken. REPAIR THIS ROOM. I have included pictures of the sliding mirror and its destroyed portion.

The security peep-hole was filled with some kind of mysterious tissue. I did not want to touch it, so I took a picture. What kind of hotel misses a disgusting thing like this?

The breakfast in-room dining card on my door was already filled out from the previous guest. I'm thankful I noticed and threw it away. Imagine if the staff discovered it and thought I had ordered it? It did not have a date, so I averted a major annoyance by finding this mistake.

The last thing I want to talk about is the bar, Bar '75. A 5-star hotel bar with 5-star hotel prices and a bar staff ready to fall asleep at any moment. This place is literally purgatory in the form of a hotel bar. The staff look so bored and annoyed with their jobs. The female and male working that night were so unpleasant. They just gave a half smile and said ""Want another?"" as you got 3/4 finished with your drink. I tried to speak to the two workers, and they just seemed like they couldn't want for 1AM to come so they could get out. Retrain them or reassign them. A bar should have happy, outgoing people working there. They will do much better in accounting or laundry services.

The only pleasant people I encountered at the hotel were the youngsters cleaning the rooms and corridors and the young ones opening doors. They were respectful and polite each time I encountered them. They always said good morning or hello and asked if everything was okay. Wow! Imagine that, such a difficult concept. Ask your guest if they are happy. Amazing! Good for them.

Perhaps the rest of the hotel staff should be trained by the laundry and room cleaning staff.",Trip type: Travelled with family,,12 ,25 ,,1.0

The room was clean and bright and well appointed. The bed was comfy and the shower was divine with great pressure and nice hot water. I got a great nights sleep, no real airport noise, both nights.

The bar is nice albeit a bit pricey ( aren't all bars in Singapore). There is a nice pool and outdoor area to get some fresh air. The restaurant is ok, I ate there twice once for dinner and once for an early breakfast, no complaints.

Check out was also seamless, very professional and very quick.

I found all the staff polite and attentive. Lets face it I wasn't here for a holiday but if your so inclined there is lots to do with the airport right here. All up from an airport hotel all I want is a good nights sleep a nice hot shower and a meal.

I provided the booking website confirmation number in my email. Nothing back.
I didn't have time to be hanging about waiting for replies, I needed to know, so I made an inquiry on another hotel, and got a reply back within an hour, confirming late check out.
TWO DAYS later I got a reply from Crowne, yes TWO DAYS. Not only did they not answer my inquiry, they requested a confirmation number that bore no resemblance to the one I had from the booking site that I had already provided.

I've noticed the price of rooms fluctuates a lot so it could be good value (around SGD$200 or less) or worth avoiding (often more than SGD$350 for a basic room).

1) Booked 3 rooms under Booking.com, 1 under my name, 2 under my wife's.

2) They charged my card for my 1 room TWICE after checking my account with the bank (and as of 14 Feb, have yet to process my claim)

3) Wife called them more than 5 times to confirm and reconfirm details regarding the booking under her name even before we checked in on the 6th and yet voila, on the 6th when we arrived, they still had everything wrong.

4) Informed them to cancel the hold on my wife's card as I paid for the 2 rooms under her name when we checked in on the 6th and yet, they charged the card again and for the kicker, instead of contacting us to reimburse the extra charge, emailed us to inform us that we were a no-show(!)

5) (saved the best for last) After countless times on the phone with them, the staff who was taking down the details of my case was so eager to get off the phone, she didn't even wait for me to list my email address when she promised to email me regarding this investigation. Of course, when I requested that she reread my email address, she was suitably stumped...

Got myself a premier room, 2ds over Christmas. Located on the top floor, the front faces the tarmac and is a treat for plane spotters. Saw SQ planes most, but still managed to spot a BR, UA, CI and VN. The control tower and planes taking off can be seen at a distance from the room window.

Very good amenities; there were even some transit related amenities that help with jet lag or so it read. The room show some signs of ageing, but is well maintained and very clean; no complaints here.

The room door is very heavy for sound proofing. But for very light sleeper, the airplane sound might still bother. Being a light sleeper myself, after some booze, the sound is very bearable; almost like somebody is vacuuming the floor 6 rooms away from me. My staycate mate has no complaint; being somebody who fall asleep easily anywhere.

The daily buffet breakfast spread in the room package is very good and highly recommended for a decadent start of the day.

Overall is a bit pricey, but is an interesting experience that I would have a go again. And the property is luxurious vs. a lot of other airport hotels I stayed in before.

It was during the NYE weekend so most of the hotels in Singapore will be expensive and our first option would have been hotels in Marina area just to catch the fireworks & better view. But we chose Crowne since the club room price is still reasonable for festive period. It was a good decision made after evaluating the stay!

We checked in at 1.30pm to drop off our luggage but to our surprise, the room is ready but I guess it's also becos we mentioned that it's our mini honeymoon so they needed time to prep the room with swan towels and deco. The room is spacious, warm colour tone and really comfortable. We stayed at the 8th floor so get to see planes taking off. A little cheap thrill moment is when I saw their Orla Kiely toiletries (fan girl!) with lovely geranium scent!

The service is really fabulous, at all touch points, the staff will congratulate us and even have calls to remind us to use the club lounge and claim our drinks from the bar. The club lounge is a quiet and cozy place. Love the cookies that they served!

We will definitely return for another staycation. :) As long as the price is right, we will return soon.

THE STAY WAS BEYOND PERFECT. And I‚Äôd have given it a 6-star rating if there was ever one! Granted an early check-in and the staff at the reception area was really patient in explaining the different types of rooms and club privileges that we were entitled to. Basically, we could choose between the rooms on Level 3, where the pool and Club Lounge is situated at, and the rooms on the higher levels for more privacy. According to her, we‚Äôre really lucky to have gotten one of the rooms with pool access (since we did not put it down under special request beforehand) because the demand for these rooms are extremely high, especially during festive seasons. On our way to the room, I love the concept of having an open-space corridor with landscaping elements and water features; it was definitely something we seldom see in other hotels. When we entered the room, I couldn‚Äôt stop squeaking in delight because the room had such an amazing view! And I was extremely thrilled at the idea of having the landscaped pool just right at our door step. The best part of the whole stay was the pool access; but of course, do expect pool goers to loiter casually outside your room. Other than that, the king-sized bed was comfortable and the bathroom was huge with a good range of bath amenities. They even have this room mist for guests to enjoy a better sleep, how tactful is that?! Cocktail hours at the Club Lounge are from 5.30pm to 9.30pm (way longer than what the usual hotel lounges offer) with a wide range of drinks to choose from. We actually had our dinner at the lounge because they prepared a mini buffet during the cocktail hours! If the food at the lounge isn‚Äôt enough to fill your stomach, you could always head down to the restaurants within the hotel or simply go over to Terminal 3. All the servce staff on duty are very polite, and we‚Äôd like to give a special shoutout to Mustafa, who was really friendly, helpful and professional in answering our questions regarding the drinks and whether we should have breakfast at Azur or the Club Lounge the next morning. Ended the night with an in-room entertainment movie and supper from McDonalds. Had a good night rest and managed to catch the sunrise from our room in the morning. As for breakfast, we chose to have it at Azur instead of the Club Lounge as we prefer variety over privacy. Breakfast selection at Azur was great with a variety of Chinese, Western and Indian vegetarian food to choose from. Had our last swim before checking out and we were really sad to leave.

In conclusion, we‚Äôd definitely be back again! Highly recommendeded for staycations and business travelers with long transiting flight times! For tourists who are here in Singapore for holidays, please note that Crowne Plaza Changi is not near the town area where all the shopping happens.

It is an excellent hotel in its own right but the proximity to the Changi terminals coupled with the luxury makes it the best transit hotel I have ever stayed in. It is an oasis in the madness of the airport.

If you arrive into Terminal 3 it is a 2 minute walk max once you are through customs etc. to the hotel. Check in was easy both visits. My second visit I arrived a full 5 hours before check in time and the staff were able to give me my room - that is exactly the sort of service you want on a return visit, and after a 12 hour flight!!! The rooms themselves are very comfortable, large beds, quiet and good amenities in the bathroom - no need for you to unpack your suitcase. Be aware that the bathrooms have glass walls so limited privacy if you are travelling with parents/siblings/kids/platonic friends!!

Wifi is free and I found it great in the room, but it didn't seem to work around the pool area and the breakfast restaurant.

The pool area is beautiful and well serviced with fresh towels etc. Spotlessly clean. Highly recommend a refreshing dip!! Again, you would never know you were so close to the airport.

Breakfast was a very plentiful and varied buffet - fruit, cereals, breads and pastries, eggs, french toast, international selections - what you would expect of a 5 star breakfast buffet. The second time I was there the restaurant was very full and I had to wait for a table.

Good experience each time.Check in is generally fast, although the check in area is not large and there can sometimes be a delay depending purely on the volume of people checking in or out.  Also, there are people from practically every part of the world staying at this hotel, and it's not uncommon to hear somewhat amusing 'lost in translation' conversations between bemused travelers and well meaning hotel staff.After check in, one of the more unusual aspects of this hotel is the outdoor walkways between the elevator and the rooms.  It's kind of reminiscent of an atrium hotel, but in the tropical heat.  I quite like it since it localizes the hotel and reminds the traveler they are in the tropics regardless of where they are traveling to or from.The rooms I have stayed in are large, with top amenities including large flatscreen TV's, bottled water and an enormous bathtub with separate shower.One of the most novel aspects of staying in this hotel is the airport gates are literally right downstairs from the hotel.  So aircraft of all types come and go constantly right down from your room.  The breakfast buffet is enormously varied with something for practically every taste and diet.

Negative is the very dark decoration and lack of sufficient lights which makes it so depressive just to walk inside lobby and corridors. Cheap to have the room corridors open to save in construction cost and aircon. This is a city hotel and not a resort where you can do that.

I love the huge bathroom with a big bathtub and a separate shower.
Lots of bath amenities and three bottles of water.

Swimming pool is larger than expected with lots of plants.
I stayed at Shangri-La, Traders, Regent, Mandarin Oriental, Mandarin Orchard and Changi village hotel before, and compared to other hotels in Singapore, the swimming pool at Crowne Plaza is one of the best, in terms of the size, cleanness and resort feeling. ( By the way, my most favorite pool is Shangri-La's, because of their hot jacuzzi. )

As an IHG member, I received a drink coupon to use at any hotel outlets. So I went to the lounge with my parents and ordered a glass of white wine, red wine, fresh guava juice and mango pudding and hazelnut cake.
Because there was a 2 for 1 desert campaign after 20:00, not only drinks but also the hazelnut cake was free. So I only paid 5 Singapore dollars when checking out. Both drinks and deserts were very very tasty! My parents were so impressed with the high quality of service at the hotel.

Next morning, we had a breakfast. So many variety. From Indian foods to Chinese food and Western food.
I liked Chicken curry, roast pork paw, cheese, salami, scramble egg salmon, croissant and fish ball noodle.
Slightly disappointed with Indian nan and papaya.(tasted like the one we had on the plane. )

Every staff we met was very kind and polite.
When we checked out, the reception staff told us very kindly how to get to the terminal 2. (Sky train was under renovation at that time.)

First, after landing around midnight, it was nice to pick up my luggage and simply walk over to the hotel from the airport terminal ... no need to wait in a lengthy taxi queue.  Reception was not as fast as I expected given many international flights arrive at all hours of the day and night.

The decor and lighting in the lobby and public areas is extremely dark and gloomy. Everything worked efficiently and room 847 was fine and comfortable, but it is just an average, ordinary, business traveller hotel. I imagine that the good reviews come from travellers breaking their journeys who are delighted to have a wash and a good sleep.

Most often than not there is hardly any people in the gym even after office hours (I like it :))  Swimming pool is a 20 or 25 meter straight pool. pretty decent.

We joined the Hotel loyalty program and were rewarded with a free drink each - I had tea and cheesecake which was so elegant. Joined happy hour in the Sports bar and the food was good quality, however quite expensive for a plate of salad and satay chicken sticks.

The only negative I can say about this hotel is that on our last check out we ask the woman at the front desk if she would know what terminal international flights would be departing from and she was very rude and abrupt and also gave us the wrong terminal.  We almost missed our flight because of her.  I would have thought a hotel located in the airport would at least have staff that could have directed us to somewhere in the airport where we could get our questions answered.

Date of stay: February 2015,Seeingtheworldwideeyed,Sweet Surrender,"Haha! Am feeling the romance in the air where Crowne Plaza Changi Airport hotel is concerned - hence the title above. But it's no exaggeration. This is our 5th stay at the hotel to break journey to other destinations, and we just love it.

With this visit, we booked a room with two double beds as there were three of us. Double beds, almost queen size. And as always, very comfortable beds with quality linen.

From the fine furniture to the abstract orchid mural on the glass wall of the bathroom, you just can't help but think Crowne Plaza Changi Airport Hotel is made to give a sensual timeout to weary world travellers.

The guest rooms ""float"" over beautifully landscaped courtyards with water, palms and fauna. The open-air corridors, with curtains of creepers, allow natural light into the room foyer and bathroom.

We do like the substantial array of hot and cold breakfast food. You can ask the egg-station chef to make half-boiled eggs (not the usual order) and if you forget to collect, the breakfast staff will bring them to your table. However, among the hot offerings, the hot noodle soup with tasteless, rubbery ""fish balls"" and MSG-ed soup somehow fell short of my expectations. The hotel may need to review its fishball supplier and look at fresh, organic ingredients to make good soup.

As if knowing the habits of travellers, the hotel supplies every room with a weighing scale. It is a big help - mind you, it's so easy to go overboard on holiday shopping in Singapore.

Yes, we like the very modern, well-equipped gym. And the pool.

The front desk officer was very accommodating to our request and gave us a room on the 9th floor facing the runway. She was nice enough to tell us there might be some construction going on but we hardly disturbed. The deluxe room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable . Very nice swimming pool on the 3rd floor with great view of the iconic control tower. All in all, our little girl slept the night though with us and we were very refreshed for our long flight . Thanks to the staff and management for the wonderful night.

Tip:

1) Get a room on the higher floors facing the runways. There might be plane engine noise but if my baby girl can sleep through it, I'm sure you can..

2) Take a taxi ride to Changi village for dinner . You would probably spend about 15 dollars on the cab ride but it's well worth the reasonably priced and delicious local food ..",,"Singapore, Singapore",51 ,22 ,,4.0

However, disappointment struck in the seemingly thoughtless opening times of the pool (closes early and opens late). This is a stopover hotel so I would imagine most guests arrive late and leave early so it baffles me as to why the pool closes so early and opens so late. This might not bother some people but it did bother us as it would have been nice to have had the chance to relax in the pool either the night before or the morning of our 14 hour flight back to London.

The room is nice too with both shower and a bath tub. I like the mini sofa in front of the bed and tv though the tv can be clearer. They had a simple cake for us for our anniversary and offered late check out till 4pm!  If only we could get free parking, ha, but it was difficult as the parking is shared with the airport.

The rooms are very nice with comfortable beds, good shower or bath and all of those nice touches of a good high quality hotel. It is beside a very busy airport but you will not hear the planes at all in your room.

One feature of the hotel is the ‚Äòyou are in tropical asia‚Äô feeling that you get as the corridors to the rooms as open air to the side, so you do not feel like that you are indoors until you get to your room. The bar is very nice with both indoor and outdoor sections. Drinks are expensive, as they are in all of Singapore.

You can have a meal in the hotel, walk back into the Airport and have a meal in the food chains there or hop in a taxi and go into town for what will be an excellent meal there.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"London, United Kingdom",267 ,130 ,5.0,

My only gripe really is a bit unusual. I am a fan of the English Premier League and I picked this hotel so I could get off my flight, check-in, then watch the game - I was pushed for time. Unfortunately the TV channel menu was not what you would expect from such a prestigious hotel. I probably should have checked but I've stayed in a lot worse hotels that can at least provide a good menu of TV channels.

Our rooms overlooked the runway which was Novel and althought we could hear the planes taking off all day it added to the treat.
We ordered lunch around the pool and it was delivered and set up really nice. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The pool was devine as where its surroundings.

And having ready access to the airport's public area was convenient for shopping and dining.  And it's located right next to the airport train stop so getting to any terminal is easy.

Perfect for transit passengers and for those who wants to explore the eastern side of Singapore instead of the crowded city area.  Swimming pool is a perfect place to wind down. Quiet and pretty peaceful. Love it!  Thanks to Sarah from the Front Desk for accomodating to my request, she got us a room with a beautiful view; airport runway. Where else would you get a room facing the runway with planes and landing and taking off. My cousin loves the view and she couldn't have thank Sarah more. And thank you very much for the extra hours that was given to us, to check out at 2pm. That was indeed a nice gesture.   With all that, I can conclude that I would definitely make another reservations pretty soon!",,,25 ,4 ,5.0,

Getting red wine as welcome drink (since i am IHG member) is refreshing, the room is fabulous, i got a room near the pool with direct access through the window. the only concern maybe noise when there is a flight but we can request to get more quiet room. restaurant for breakfast is sufficient for me, and they provide shuttle bus to changi business park (although not vice versa). and to make it more efficient, it just walk away when you landed in terminal 3 :)",,"Jakarta, Indonesia",8 ,9 ,4.0,

Only criticism is we were rather stung at the buffet dinner in the restaurant which was perhaps our own fault for not asking the cost prior to indulging!!  It was a sumptous spread with lobster, sushi but we weren't expecting it to be ¬£50 a head when one of us was a 12 year old girl who eats like a bird.

You can even disregard your current perception of the Crowne Plaza chain because frankly this airport has very little in common with it.

After having toured the clean and efficient but hot and steamy city and meandered around the impressive and very calming botanical gardens we found ourselves having to leave our cruise mother ship at 0915 am with over 10 hours to kill before our flight back to Australia that evening.  Not wishing to do any more touring we decided to book a day room at the Crowne Plaza which is positioned at Terminal 3 on Changi Airport. And what a good decision this turned out to be.

It has unique charm and character and does not fit into the cookie cutter box of most Marriotts, Sheratons or for that matter other Crown Plazas.  The architecture of this hotel is brilliant. I love the way the rooms open up to the outside and how the corridors zig n zag. This give an overall open and clean feeling.

He immediately offered me a plate with a freshly made mixed-veggie omelette. I jokingly told him that he must have known I was coming and what my preferences were.

One of the interesting design features of the Crowne Plaza is the fact that the third floor hallways are open to the outside.

The check in was done by a receptionist who really was the most unhelpful & rudest member of staff I have ever come across, no smile, no warmth..nothing!! ( I have been a receptionist so am aware that ""first impressions"" are very important). I arrived at the hotel late at night with my family from Bali and were staying for one night as we has a connecting flight the next morning. Two rooms  had been booked for 5 people and when my husband enquired if there was an extra bed in one of the rooms he was told that the king size bed could accommodate him and our 10 yr old twins easily. Well, he was not happy with the response he got from the receptionist but she insisted that the 3 of them would all fit comfortably and to try it out. As it was late & with tired children off we went to ""try it out"". The rooms were ok for an overnight stay ,a bit small but very convenient for its proximity to the airport. The bed in the room was indeed a king size and if my 6ft 2 husband and twins wanted to sleep like tightly packed sardines all night it would have been fine. My husband then spent the next hour back in reception trying to get another bed in the room which another receptionist (thank god) sorted out. To top it all off when i woke up the next morning and went to the bathroom I discovered a huge pool of water and a leak coming from the ceiling. Two phone calls later I was told they were sending someone to have a look which when you have already waited half an hour and need to get ready to catch your flight is really not acceptable. I have to say my first impression of Singapore all thanks to Agnes on the front desk is not a very positive one.

It was great to have the hotel connected to the airport. We had checked our luggage all the way through from Melbourne to Taipei so we only brought our hand carry with us to the hotel. The location was convenient, we were able to wake up later since the walk to security/gates was not very far.

The room has a nice interior, it was clean and fresh. The baby cot that the hotel supplied free of charge was a travel cot. It was good enough.

Breakfast was abundant, lots of choices and quite delicious.

Staff that we encountered at check-in and at breakfast were friendly and courteous.

The pool area was nice although we did not actually swim in it.

The only reason why I would not give this hotel 5 stars is the price. I do think it's overpriced and probably would not stay there again.

Once you stay here you understand why this hotel has been awarded one of the top ten airport hotels in the world. Not only is it an actual airport hotel that is connected directly to terminal 3 (unlike some other airport hotels where you still need to take a shuttle), it literally took me 6 minutes from checking out of the hotel to when I went through customs to catch my flight. No, it oozes style, space, comfort and luxury that is seldom found in any other airport hotel.

The rooms are bright (but completely block out when needed so you can get rest after a long flight) with luxuriously huge bathrooms, a sensational shower and super bath. The bed is comfy, and pillows just right. The pool looks stunning and the fitness centre absolutely perfect, I only wish I had time to have used both of them.

The breakfast is one of the better ones I've experienced at a Singapore hotel (although being asked if I want a coffee refill 4 times by 4 different staff members in the space of 3 minutes is a tad over-servicing).

This is by far my favourite Singapore hotel, and would seriously consider staying here even when not just transiting through.

Rooms are modern with a great rain shower, the only amenity I missed were slippers to go to the swimming pool, you would expect these for this type of hotel. And the swimming pool you really do not want to miss, although not deep enough for a very good lap swim, the pool is long enough to enjoy your laps if you want to.
Rooms are very quiet, even if you are close to the runaway as I was (enjoy the view!).

The hotel has a great breakfast buffet with both European/American and Asian food.
During my return trip I stayed another night and had to check out 5am, but a to go breakfast was prepared for me which I easily could hand-carry on the plane. The details do make the difference!

Food is good. One bad element is that you have to walk through a hot and humid courtyard to get to the rooms, which isn't helpful when the goal of the hotel is providing much-needed rest and comfort to weary travellers.

The hotel is pretty much smacked in the middle of the airport, thus easily accessible to all terminals via the sky train which was just around the corner of the hotel.

Expensive - but when you consider the cost of a taxi into the city, and the value of an extra 30 minutes of sleep before a 6 AM flight I think it is worth it.",,"Baltimore, Maryland",41 ,23 ,4.0,

The rooms are clean, quiet and huge. It is surprising how quiet the hotel rooms are even though it is so close to the airport. I have never had any trouble sleeping. I have always booked the lowest size room but got a huge one instead. I don't know if they upgraded me (I am IHG Platinum) or all their rooms are so big. But my experience has been extremely positive.

Changi airport has hundreds of restaurants and being so close to the airport, it is tempting to go over to the airport (hotel and terminal are in same building). But the hotel also has excellent restaurants - I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel and they were always excellent, though a bit expensive.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Mumbai, India",6 ,7 ,5.0,

The only plus point is that the room is very comfortable but the service is zero. The staff at the reception are very arrogant. When we arrived we were extremely tired but still we had to wait for them to check all papers and ask us for $100 as advance if ever we take something from the mini bar. This took approx 30 mins. On the next day when we were leaving the room we noticed there were many paper trash behind the bed that has not been cleaned. Still on leaving the hotel at the reception they did not make any attempt to give us our money back and when we asked for it they made us wait for like 15 mins when we had a flight to catch and gave us the money back in Singaporean dollar when we were leaving the country.

I booked hotel on live chat ( with a real person ) at hotel website which I never done before as I needed different timing to suits my needs. My every request was fullfiled. Hotel is about 30 seconds walk after immigration on T3. No need to even leave the building. Room was ready at 8am so I could rest before my next flight. Rooms are very smartly designed with practical ideas to maximise space. Room and bathroom has all you expect from luxury facility and for the airplane fans...you can see both runways and without the noise. The pool area is amazing so do not miss a quick splash there with a lovely cocktail. Checking out was again smooth and quick and free glass of chardonay ( for IHG hotel members) just perfectly finished it off my stay.

Check in and out was efficient and service was good.

Service at the sports bar and at the breakfast restaurant was terrible though. At breakfast I had difficulty getting the chef at the omelette bar to acknowledge me or to come over to cook! I was the only person there and he looked at me multiple times. He seemed very angry about something and scowled when he finally came over to make eggs. My wife ordered Eggs Benedict off the menu. They never did arrive and finally we had to cancel the order as we had a plane to catch. We informed the hostess that we were not happy with the service but she really didn't seem to care.

Date of stay: October 2013,TopGun666,Great Overnight Stay,"With a 17 hour stop over in Singapore I was initially hesitant about booking an IHG branded hotel after a horrendous stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square (New York). The Crowne Plaza Times Square would rate in my humble opinion as the most arrogant bunch of misfits trying to run a hotel.
Well what a surprise the Crowne Plaza Changing turned out to be. Top location in T1 at Changi. A short trip from T3. The check in was faultless...quick, smooth, cheerful, welcoming and very courteous.
After my previous experience at Times Square, I throughout out all my loyalty cards including the Inter-continental Ambassador. But I was still on record. They treated us as a long lost IHG rewards client coming back. A couple of free drinks in the lobby lounge. Great after a long flight. The room was perfect for our requirements. The bed ranks as one of the best I have slept in a while. Very minimal noise from aircraft movements etc. The bathroom was excellent. Great amenities but the only gripe.... The shaver provided in the kit by the hotel was useless. It felt like shaving with a blunt shovel. If you are going to provide a shaver, at least proved a descent one.
The early morning check out went very smoothly.
The Crowne Plaza Changi is expensive. But Singapore is an expensive place for hotels, full stop. You generally don't get much for your buck unless your are prepared to pay.
The only other option for transit passenger at Changi is the Ambassador Transit Hotel. Top buck for six hour blocks. Just not worth it for a -7 hour transit stop over.
Over all, Crowne Plaza Changi exceeded my expectations but because of a previous experience with an IHG hotel, I won't be staying at any of their properties unless there is no alternative. A bit harsh but...",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,7 ,13 ,4.0,

Date of stay: June 2013,ExLibris76,Singapore's most convenient?,"Stayed for one night in early June 2013 on my way to Australia from Egypt. Usually I stay near vibrant Orchard Road, however, because my incoming flight was arriving late and my connection was early next morning, I broke habit and booked at Changi Crown Plaza. Read on to find out if I would do it again.

From Arrivals in Terminal 3, its an easy walk to Crowne Plaza. I was smartly checked in by the receptionist who acknowledged my IHG status and gave me an upgrade. IHG Platinums are entitled to upgrades, which is something I never will take for granted after having been upgraded by several degrees on this occasion!

The suite was very clean and spacious and tastefully decorated in contemporary style, featuring lots of blond wood furniture and paneling with tones of olive green and light beige in the living/bedroom areas. The bathroom was light brown stone throughout with corresponding modern design touch. The full walk-in wardrobe was the largest I had seen in a hotel and was more than enough for me! All the amenities which we now take for granted were there in full measure, i.e. mini-bar, ironing board, cable TV etc. Naturally, after a long flight from Cairo the first thing i did was take a long hot shower and not unexpectedly, the toiletries and bath linen were really top notch. Before slipping into bed I tried the wi-fi connection and found it to be both fast and reliable. Finally, the bed itself was really comfortable, which is one thing which IHG seems to get consistently right, in my opinion.

It was at this point standing in this excellent suite that I really regretted only having one night here, which meant that I would not be able to try out the pool, gym, restaurants etc. Therefore, the solid 4* I'm giving is based purely on the room.

All in all, I was very pleased with the suite and would recommend Changi Crowne Plaza to those who don't fancy the twenty minute ride into town by taxi, or slightly longer by MRT at such late hours. It certainly is Singapore's most convenient hotel in this regard.

Their little thank you for being our member do make you feel good to continue to give business their way.

Check in was quick and efficient, but we are particularly impressed with breakfast in the restaurant. Where most hotel will let people queue at their egg station, they were happy to take our order and it was brought to us. Selection was excellent with most international tastes catered for. We are overall also very impressed with their quality.

The only little things that has taken the shine off was I was told I was upgraded to the suite but I have booked the suite. There doesn't seem to be anything to offer to occupy the little one (or we were just not told), but a hotel can't suit for everyone's needs.

Second surprise was that the rooms face outside open aircorriders. No really a problem though.
Room was amazing in decor and comfort.
Interent was included and very fast.
Check out was fast and of course I was at the airport check in counter in 2-3 minutes.
The room rate was a bit hard to accept though.
My coworker found it hard to pick me up at the hotel as the entrance is complicated on the airport roads.
I would recommend as long as the room rate is better than it was for this visit.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Nashville, TN USA",494 ,230 ,4.0,

I was very impressed with this hotel as these were my very first Crowne Plaza experience. The hotel is linked with T3 so you do not need to leave the terminal after clearing the custom. It is a very groovy hotel with sleek and ultra modern design throughout. I was assigned to a Double Double room, which has two double beds. The room is very spacious and despite being just metres away from the runways, the insulation was excellent, you could not hear a wisper.The check in process was efficient. As IHG member, I was offered a free drink voucher each time I stay there. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The 24 hour gym is more than well equipped.

The rooms them self are fantastic every thing you need and more. The photos show detailed layouts, the hotel provided us with a cot too... All the staff was increably friendly with us as was most in the airport...
We did hear a little noise from the airplanes but nothing at all major.
I used the gym and it was fantastic.
We got a taxi into singapore very easy, and quick. As most say its the location that's the best thing as we flew the next morning and had to check in by 06.30 am which was so easy as we was already there.....

The cost of booze in Singapore is high anywhere but the bar prices at the hotel are over the top. All is not lost the basement of terminal 3 has a large range of cheap eats and better drink prices. There is even a small supermarket - this is where the airport staff eat  rather than use the hotel or the outlets on the arrival and departure levels. The hotel itself is really very nice by any standard and suprisingly so for an airport hotel and if you can snag a room on the third floor where the swimming pool is located there are water features that provide a very relaxing ambience and the rooms are large and well designed. If it wasn't for the bar and food prices I would give it 5 stars. By the way terminal 3 also has the subway station so if you dont have too much luggage it costs small $2 Singapore to the city. Taxis fares are not too bad although if you hit rush hour and go to the city your metered fare can double with all types extras such airport picup fee, city zone fee and others.",Trip type: Travelled on business,Sydney,143 ,90 ,4.0,

Walked straight from arrivals into the hotel without even going outside, which was convenient in the rain.
Hotel room was overlooking the pool, which we loved and it made our two night stopover seem like a longer holiday. The bathroom had a wonderful deep bath for relaxing and a big window into the main bedroom, which made it very light. The pool was clean and refreshing with plenty of deckchairs, and being a transit hotel, there was rapid turnover on the chairs anyway. The maze formation of the pool with the palm tree gardens scattered throughout made it more fun for the kids.
Room service food was good, but the buffet breakfast in the Azur was the best value for money - so many different foods to choose from, including curries! My only comment is that there were no gluten-free breads/muffins available.
Kids enjoyed the pool and the fitness room, and also going back into the airport for shopping - it's all GST free even if you shop in the external public areas.

Date of stay: September 2013,SporeSamSeng,Very nice!,"Stayed recently for 1 night at the suite.  All Deluxe rooms were looking at the ""full"" runway. And the suites were all looking at ""partial"" runway.  But we ended up taking the suite because it's a fantastic room, doubled the usual rooms.  The view of the partial runway looks out towards incoming planes getting in line to land.  Watching planes land every 1-2mins from the room, is better than watching from the viewing gallery of airports where usually you could only see the planes stopping or accelerating....As this is still a relatively new hotel, it's a great joy to stay here.  Swimming pool was nice but it was somehow very cold even during noon time.  I guess it was cloudy and so there wasn't enough sun to heat the pool.   Having a heated pool would be great.  The lobby looked very cosy too.Staff were all very courteous, polite, ..... everything's top marks except for the carpark.   Hotel claims that they do not own the carpark as such there are no discounts for carpark.  You can pay a max $20 provided your car stays in the carpark continuously for 24hrs.  The problem with me was that I needed to drive in/out every few hours since we are locals.   So in the end I paid almost $40 for the 1 night stay here.  I saw there was a wedding dinner at the hotel lobby restaurant where the wedding couple were dishing out carpark coupons - which is a normal practise but that made me wonder why the hotel claim they don't have anything.  I think it would be great if we could pay a fix rate for unlimited access in/out within 24hrs.",Trip type: Travelled with family,Singapore,161 ,112 ,5.0,

The rooms and common areas are impeccably kept and the beds are terrifically comfortable.  We ate at the restaurant one night and the buffet on offer was one of the best we've had - although at $S75 it isn't cheap (but then nothing in Singapore is). The pool area is outstanding - a Balinese garden style and very refreshing after a long flight. The hotel is right above the MRT which will take you into town in about 35 mins.

Spotlessly clean bathroom and everything you might need in easy reach. We ate in the Imperial Chinese Restaurant on the ground level and the service was superb. The menu was very extensive and the food prepared with skill. No noise from the aircraft overnight and a great breakfast in the morning ended a wonderful but quick overnight stay.

Lobby color scheme definitely helps with jet-lag. Room is identical to web-site photos. Unfortunately I do not remember the room number but it was facing the runway and was neither on the higher or lower floors. Good sound-proofing. Surprisingly more noise heard from front door side of room compared to runway side.

CD player was a nice touch. Good for relaxing in the bath. Only gripe was the poor finish of joinery and pipes around and under the bathroom vanity which is noticeable when lying in the bath-tub.

Could not get used to tacky flower stickers on the glass separating bath room and bed room. A rather cheap-looking solution for a functional problem which appears to have been discovered too late in the building process.

Date of stay: April 2013,TheTravellingKings,inadequacies for their major customer groups,"Like all airport hotels, the Crowne Plaza mostly caters to two groups of related people. Business men/women, and those with very short layovers who still want a nice place to stay and sleep. To be clear, I fell into the second group.

That being said, there were some problems/frustrations, that could be changed easily to make this a great airport hotel. First the positives: great room with a spacious gorgeous bathroom (soaking tub and rain shower), great pool for an airport hotel, decent gym, convenience (attached to terminal three).

The problems:
1. 25 SGD for WiFi. Yes...you heard that right. You are within 50 feet of the changing airport terminal where you can get free WiFi...and yet they charge 25 Singh. Plus, if you have more than one device they try to set up a router in your room and want you to sign that you are responsible for it. As a business centered hotel...this is just unacceptable. As a hotel attached to an airport with free WiFi, it's highway robbery.
2. Pool closes at 8. Yes, not nine or ten but eight. It was barely dark out. There explanation when called? ""It's dark out"". Um...that is why you have pool lights. People using an airport hotel are on all sorts of schedules....to close the pool so early is just silly and not very supportive of travellers with layovers who want to get the most out of the hotel.
3. Charging for the business centre. Similar to number one, just not what I expect from a business hotel.

Also note, if you need to be in terminal two or one before five the sky train is closed until five. There is a shuttle you can take which runs every fifteen minutes. A taxi from terminal three to terminal one was estimated at ten dollars from the front staff. This isn't the hotels fault really...just something that does reduce its ""convenience"" factor just a little.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Houston, Texas",53 ,23 ,3.0,

When you walk into Terminal 3, a sharp right and you are at the tram which will quickly shuttle you to the other terminals.

The food in the Chinese restaurant (first floor) is wonderful (Singaporeans come to this restaurant even when they are not flying in or out of Changi). The front desk staff are very helpful. The rooms are clean and modern. By Singapore standards, the hotel rate is reasonable.

I have one criticism and that is the air conditioning, when you are in bed the cold air goes from the wall on to your face and you have a freezing face in bed. I have stayed there 3 times in the last 8 weeks and it has been the same in every room.

We absolutely loved the hotel and it made the long journey more tolerable. The hotel is easy to find both from T3 arrivals and from the skytrain if you arrive in a different terminal.

On the way out we had a room overlooking the pool and on the way back our room overlooked the terminal and runway. Both were spacious, comfortable and well equipped. The soundproofing was good, we could hear some aeroplane noise but not enough to disturb our sleep.

The pool is very nice and very refreshing after a long journey. We did find it a little bit cold but otherwise lovely.

We had breakfast included on the way back and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a buffet but all very fresh with a vast selection of different types of food and everything we had was delicious.

The best thing about the hotel is its proximity to Changi Business Park (and the airport): If your work is mostly in CBP then this is the best place to stay. The hotel is practically in T3 and easily accessible. A 10 min shuttle bus will get you to CBP and your work (the driver needs some convincing though if you don't happen to work in IBM - I don't).

A good night's sleep, immediately after such a long flight was extremely welcome.

The room itself was well appointed, large and clean. The bathroom was also quite large and offered both a tub and a shower.

From the hotel/airport, there is a choice of cab or MRT into the city (although if I were staying longer, I'd be inclined to use a hotel in the city).  Two small comments: (i) I experienced some difficulties in getting the card to open the room: one needs actually to make contact with the pad rather than (as the picture indicates just point it); (ii) I used the discount advance payment option, but the hotel only charged me for this on my day of arrival (rather than, as with other IHG hotels, at the point when I made the booking).",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Wamboin, Australia",91 ,56 ,5.0,

Date of stay: December 2012,Jackal72,The best airport hotel anywhere,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza with 3 children to break up a long trip from Europe to Australia.  It is the best airport hotel I have ever stayed at, with a few small faults preventing me giving it full marks.  The good first: the location is superb - right at Terminal 3 and you can wheel your baggage trolley right into the hotel.  The pool is one of the nicest hotel pools I have seen anywhere - a really huge open air pool with tropical plantings in the centre.  There was also a spa and fitness centre that we didn't have time to use, but they looked lovely.  There were trays of chocolate cakes in the room when we arrived and a biscuit left at turn down.  There are all the bathroom toiletries a traveller could ever need - toothbrushes and shaving kits - which was a godsend for us because we weren't able to retrieve our luggage in transit.  Some small issues: 1) There are no inter-connecting rooms.  Our children are just old enough that we were happy to have rooms next door to one another, but a few years ago this would have been a been a big problem. 2) The beds are extremely hard and quite uncomfortable, although we were so happy to be lying down flat as opposed to in an economy seat that it was less of a concern that it might otherwise have been.  3) Check in took an inordinately long time for no apparent reason.  4) I couldn't see an express check out facility, but this would have been very useful given that most people were rushing to get flights  5) Request a room away from the lifts.

Trying to find the hotel from within the airport wasn‚Äôt that straight forward, even with a previous reviewer‚Äôs instructions as there are no signs anywhere and the entrance looks like a dark tunnel.  The actual room was nice and there was no airport noise.  There was however a large stool in the middle of the room that I managed to stub my toe on, trying to get to the bathroom during the night.  The breakfast was ok, but the lighting in the restaurant was very dark and there were no views out over the pool etc.  The swimming pool area was beautiful but it was too cold to swim. I think in hindsight I would have booked a hotel in the city with a free shuttle between the airport.  These are the instructions for finding the hotel entrance from within the airport which another reviewer posted.  ‚ÄúArriving at Terminal 1, luggage is quickly retrieved and Customs is efficient.

Date of stay: October 2012,tipu01,Nice comes with a price,"i was surprised to find my office had booked me here for two days of meetings that were in the city center. i was glad for the experience, since it's a very nice hotel, but i don't think i myself would be willing to pay the room prices if i were traveling single.

It is an admittedly nice feeling to just land @ Changi, and walk over to the reception through Terminal 3 within 5-10 minutes. Interaction with the reception staff was always nice ‚Äî in fact, all staff i came in contact with made me feel positive.

The room i first stayed in was on the fifth floor facing a runway/terminal area. You may be concerned about airport noise, so let me tell you i need reasonable silence to get to sleep quickly, so i was a bit concerned. i need not have worried: yes, while falling asleep i registered the runway noise, but once asleep under the sheets in the comfortable bed, i slept soundly.

i've to say the room is one of the nicest i've had at a hotel. Size was great, one wall fully windowed looking down on the beautiful pool, writing table, couch area in front of the TV and abutting the bed. The bathtub also windowed to allow TV watching while taking a soak, if you wish. Nice shower. At night one can pull down the shades on the room/bathroom window to get total darkness.

The room price doesn't include wifi or breakfast: i think the website should just offer these options along with a bare room as a package, rather than forcing guests to choose them separately. i was glad my office was paying for all this, since all this goodness doesn't exactly come light on the wallet. In retrospect, i definitely wouldn't pay for the wifi, and just find some wifi from the airport.

Breakfast was a nice experience though. Too many choices! i really enjoyed the fresh fruits and specially the various juice shots offered. i kept the omelette station busy, and was spoiled for choice on breakfast desserts!

For other meals, there are various spots within the hotel for food, but i used the airport area food courts ‚Äî probably a far cheaper option.

Originally i had planned to check out of the hotel after the 2 days my office booked me for, and stay the remaining weekend evenings in the city. But plans changed, and i booked my last evening at this hotel also. i left most of my luggage in storage.

One negative experience i discovered later on checking in here the second time: i had booked through a third party site (otel.com). It turned out reception appeared to confirm this booking when i was trying to check in (i was with a visiting friend, so wasn't paying too much attention). It turned out instead of using the booking i had made myself, reception just got me a new booking: they double-billed me. i didn't discover this until one month later when i was reconciling my office bills (i hope my office/credit card issuer/hotel has resolved this amicably, but i don't know what happened since i've been on vacation).

The second stay was on the 9th floor, and just as satisfying as the first time around. And since i had a relatively early morning flight, this time the location proved to be a huge plus. In fact, i am glad the lady at the breakfast reception sort of hurried me out, since i otherwise might have missed the luggage dropoff for my flight!

Overall, a very nice hotel experience at a pricey hotel for a single traveler, but it just may be worth it for a couple transiting through Changi who would prefer a hotel experience to the Changi experience.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Oslo, Norway",33 ,51 ,4.0,

Date of stay: July 2012,Macloo,Expensive but very convenient,"For $230 - $250 (U.S.$) per night (one person, one room, no breakfast), you'll expect a really nice room -- and you'll get it. Great shower and bathroom too. If you have a layover, and your flights are on different airlines, you CANNOT stay in the transit hotel that's inside Changi -- you have to go through immigration (very smooth and fast at this airport), and that means you can't stay at the transit hotel, which is more basic and cheaper.

So if you don't want to slog all your baggage downtown, and you have to go in and out through immigration, here's the Crowne Plaza. But IF YOUR FLIGHTS CONNECT, you can book at the transit hotel and save a bundle.

No matter which terminal you arrive at, you can get to the Crowne Plaza (Terminal 3) on the free airport Sky Train. The hotel entrance is on the same wall as the Sky Train entry/exit, turn left and walk. You will not see any signs for the hotel until you're in front of the hotel entrance.

There seem to be no bellboys at reception, ever, and it can be a very long, sweaty hike to your room (hallways are open air). But once you get into the room -- ah, heaven.

Straight outside the hotel entrance, you can find the MRT (subway train) to go to central Singapore. Grab the free map at the airport information desk and hop on the train. It can take almost an hour to get to Orchard Road, but the fare is only SG$2 to $3, and the MRT maps are so easy to follow. Announcements on the train are in English.

Airport hotels are generally quite sterile and impersonal, but the Crowne was pleasantly different from any we have used before.

It is fantastically convenient - a short walk or shuttle train ride depending on which terminal you arrive at. It's entrance is still within one of the terminal buildings.

As with most things Singaporean - it was fast and efficient - with check in, getting to the room, room service and check out all effortless.

The room was spacious, well appointed and comfortable without being lavish.

Obviously its location limits recreational activities - although its fitness centre looked excellent from what I could see walking past.

The breakfast we had was as good as many 5 star hotels. Room service food was not quite as good although certainly very passable for midnight when we arrived.

Crowne boasts - fairly - that this is a new level of luxury for airports. While any airport hotel is likely to have a revolving door clientele this one at least gives the impression of trying to build in a bit of warmth and it succeeds.

Water from the shower is not contained within the cubical but leaker all over the bathroom - less than ideal. The door on the shower also opens in an awkward direction.

It was impossible to move the room with the additional bed.   After complaining to housekeeping they organized their manager to look into the problem. I accepted 1 x twin room and I double room in the end.  Paul the duty manager that finally assisted us confirmed that they were heavily booked hence the issue and conceded that it was not the customers problem but the hotels for overbooking.

For the price they charge it's over the top. This is the only hotel really close to the airport so the price is hiked as no airport competition for prices.
Charging for the internet is a joke. $S35 for 24 hours connection is also daylight robbery, especially when you have paid so much for your stay already.
Staff were really unhelpful when we complained about this. They suggested my heavily pregnant wife should walk into the terminal to find free wifi. The rooms are only hard wired too even if you do have to pay the over the top charge. I believe the lobby area is wifi connected but didn't cave in to paying.
Would not look at this hotel again when we have an overnight stop in Singapore. Would probably stay in one of the hotels out of the airport and travel in given the price they charge and what you get for your money.
We got a night at a better hotel on Orchard Road, all meals included, free stocked mini bar, limousine collection etc for less than this place charges for a room for one night at the start of our trip, plus the hotel on Orchard had helpful staff.

Date of stay: April 2012,Travelinpalladin,High prices & complacency,"This is not a bad airport hotel, one in which I‚Äôve stayed a few times when I have only a few hours between connections at Changi, but need some shut eye and a shower. There are alternatives, notably a hotel inside the departure area where one can rent accommodations by the hour, if you don‚Äôt mind the tiny monk-like cell and a nearly complete absence of accoutrements. That has its uses, as well.

On the plus side Crowne Plaza rooms are spacious and comfortable, and it is very convenient to the Changi terminals. On the downs ide, on my recent stay, two of the electrical outlets reserved for guest use did not work, and the Ethernet cable needed for Internet access was broken on both ends, making it impossible for me to plug the cable into my laptop. I was not in the mood, following my 1 a.m. check in, to call maintenance or housekeeping. So I did without Internet for the night, meaning I could not Skype home to speak to my wife. Instead, I had to use my mobile ‚Äì costly!

Also, I was told upon check in that wireless was available in the ‚Äúpublic areas‚Äù. However, descending to breakfast in the morning, I was told ‚Äì upon asking‚Äîthat the restaurant (second floor) did not have wireless. Only the lobby did. So I decided to simply skip the breakfast buffet, which did not strike me as great or extensive, particularly for Asia, and simply have a coffee. When I got the bill, I was being charged S$8 for the coffee-- S$9.42, including tax, etc. I realize that these are Singapore dollars, and somewhat lower than USD. But I still found this outrageous, and declined to pay, particularly since I could not event access the Internet, which was a major goal in the first place.

So later on (after I had a more reasonably priced breakfast elsewhere in the airport), I used the wireless in the lobby. Deal there, unless one had already logged in from one's room, which, as you see above, I could not do, is that one buys a drink, then gets comp Internet access. So I bought a coffee. It was still S$9.42, but at least I got my wireless!

Date of stay: January 2012,bweebschan,Good for stopover travelers,"Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hotel early this year when we had plumbing issues at home and needed an interim accommodation. My first time to the hotel actually, and it was far enough from the city and everywhere else in Singapore to feel like I was on holiday. The lobby was dark and posh but I preferred the open-air resort style of the upper floors. The pool area was gorgeous and you can kick back and watch the planes fly overhead. Very relaxing.

The hotel room was modern, quite well-furnished but definitely on the small side. The bathroom in contrast was quite spacious, with a bathtub and the usual amenities. Personally I disliked the floral prints on the bathroom glass wall, thought it looked rather tacky although I can understand its appeal to some tourists. I did like the view of the planes taking off and landing from my room window, but a warning that the noise can be rather loud and some people might not be so keen on the lack of privacy. The restaurants at the hotel are all quite good and if you prefer something more affordance or local, the hotel is conveniently linked to the airport and the varied dining options available there.

This hotel is ideal for a stopover trip for business travelers/tourists, much better than the usual airport hotels. For longer-stay travelers, I suggest a hotel located in a more central location. One can argue that Singapore is so small that getting from one point to another is convenient and affordable, but there are many hotels which have better locations, are as good and cost around the same range.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Singapore,34 ,39 ,3.0,

I have been upgraded to a corner suite twice now - and these are huge. The bathroom alone is larger than some Asian hotel rooms! Even in the standard rooms, all the amenities are modern and clean. LCD TV's have a good selection of international channels. I have had rooms overlooking the airport side, but have never been bothered by the noise. Internet comes at a fee, which is frustrating given that it is free in the airport (and just about everywhere in Singapore).
Breakfast is good, although pricey. Nice selection of western foods, although not always very hot.
The staff have always been very friendly and helpful. I have been allowed to do an early check-in at 09:00, without extra charge.

Although the airport is some distance from the rest of the city, this poses no problem as Singapore has a very robust mass transit system.  A roughly 30-minute ride at about S$1.50 gets you downtown, or a 15 minute cab ride, at about S$14.00, so either way is very affordable.  The hotel is very beautiful.  The rooms are accessed from an open-air walkway that is lined by a bubbling stream and some well-arranged shrubbery.  The level I stayed on has a pool and a sports club, as well as a fitness center.  The rooms themselves were very nicely arranged, with all the typical business equipment.

Date of stay: November 2011,byswiss,Almost too good for just an airport nightover,"I stayed 1 night at the Crowne Plaza at Changi Aiport in early November 2011. Booking via the hotel website was easy and just like any other IHG Hotel from the chain. Rate was very reasonable, though full advance payment was required.

We arrived around midnight stepping out from the plane at the hotel. Check-in was easy and quick. Common areas are rather polished and chic and a true surprise for a Crown Plaza. The elevator takes you up to your room and there comes a big surprise: you step outside again on an outdoor walkway to your room. I am definitely not a big fan of such hotel layouts and especially in a place like Singapore, matter of personal preferences I guess.

The hotel room is obviously very nicely decorated and rather big actually! It has everything you would expect form a 4 stars room: desk and office chair, flat TV, enough storage space and nice big bathroom. While the bathroom is very stylish - it does have this transparent wall that certainly give it a nice light touch though it doesn't allow you to use the toilet without being observed which is not ideal! The hotel provides bathrobes and slippers though no free wifi.

AC was efficient, though the quietest ever, and the room was perfectly clean just like the rest the hotel. Noise isolation was good: you would not hear any of the starting or landing airplanes. Sleeping comfort was above average but not outstanding.

We did not take breakfast or use any of the hotel recreation facilities like the pool.

All in all: a perfect property for an airport nightover and certainly almost too good just to spend a night in.

Date of stay: November 2011,Agfox46,Convenient & comfortable airport hotel,"My wife & I stayed in this hotel twice in 8 days - for 1 night each time - on our way to & from Taipei in early November. Our first night was in Room 704 which had a great view over part of the airport terminal & runway for anyone interested in aircraft watching. The room itself was very comfortable despite the unusual colour scheme & overpowering frangipani motif on the glass wall between the bathroom & the sleeping area. There is a large flat-screen tv on the wall opposite the bed but it's a bit far away for comfortable in-bed viewing. We were pleased to note a rain-shower rose as well as a detachable rail shower in the bathroom. Unfortunately, the grout around the shower needed attention as did the sliding door to the wardrobe, which was gouging a line in the plaster ceiling. Fortunately, the room was very well sound-proofed & we slept well. We didn't use any of the hotel's other facilities & our check-in & check-out were quite speedy.
On our second stay, we were in Room 641, which was in better condition (re bathroom & wardrobe door) than 704 & had a view over part of the 'open inside' of the hotel. Unfortunately, the sound-proofing did not seem to be as efficient & there was some intrusive aircraft noise on occasions along with a noisy air conditioner. Fortunately, we were so tired that we managed to sleep reasonably well. On this occasion, we had breakfast included in our tariff & went down to ""Azure"" on the 2nd floor at 6.15am, where breakfast is served from 6.00am onwards, This was one of the better hotel breakfasts we've had with a great range of juice, cereals including hot oatmeal & bircher muesli, fruit, yogurt, hot food, toast & spreads. There was also an extensive offering of Asian food which we didn't examine in any detail.

Hotel is very convenient as it resides within Changi airport and is accessed via the free skytrain from the terminals (excluding budget terminal - where you can catch a free bus to main terminals). The skytrains run every few minutes it seems.

The hotel entrance is about 50 metres from skytrain, so very convenient indeed.
If coming from skytrain, you will need to enter hotel and then keep walking until you hit the escalators then take then down one level where reception / street level is.

Check in on the first stay was fast and efficient at around 10pm on the first stay. I was offered a wake up call and the lady at reception also check I was familiar with the hotel. She answered all my questions with good knowledge.However on the second stay, the man checking me in was less than helpful and it felt like I was disturbing him. He even kept checking his phone whilst trying to check in. Inconsistency in front house service.

The room is spacious and generally well maintained (except for the second stay where masking tape was used to hold parts of the room together (see single photo sample)).

There was a work desk, chair, small coffee table, flat screen TV with good reception, large bathroom with separate shower & bath. The king bed was comfortable. Overall the room was quiet enough for an airport hotel.

Room service breakfast (approx S$44) was hot and tasty and good efficient service on both stays. I would happily use room service again.

Check out both times was fast and efficient and no billing errors.

The pool was also interesting. Designed in a tropical setting, I loved to swim here and you wouldn't feel that you were at an airport at all.

Picking this hotel saved me time to travel in and out of the airport since this is just inside the airport complex.   I had actually explored the other option which was inside the transit area, but it will turn out more expensive since I had basically around 13-14 hours to spare.  And since the Singapore airport complex offers a complete place to eat, shop, and do your errands, Crowne Plaza was quite convenient.  I had planned to take the subway to the city but ended up just staying around the airport complex.  The room was marvelous, esp with the glass paneled bathroom walls which made the entire room seemed so light and refreshing.  I loved the hot bath, the soft towels and robe and relaxing time over room filled with music from my iphone, that is - after roughing it for 2 weeks.  The few hours I spent in the room upon my arrival that night made me feel like I was home.  The next day, no stress for me in catching my flight.  To me, it was more expensive than I budgetted for my trip, esp since I was volunteering, but the convenience and ambiance of the hotel made it all worth it.

Cons - We ordered room service since we arrived so late. The food quality was quite poor (noodle soup was cold and food tastes stale) Price is a bit rich for an overnight stay comparing to other Asian properties. They are charging 2xx USD a night when I think they really only deserve a rate of 180-ish USD a night. In terms of transit convenience. Sure it's close to T3, but the AIrport Transit hotel (the one INSIDE Changi) is even more convenient for our purpose. They have clean functional rooms with flat screen TVs too (just no windows) and they are charging around $120USD for an overnight double room. They were fully booked, that's why we booked the Crowne Plaza.

Should the bathroom be occupied, there was also a separate toilet room with basin.

The bed was large and was a little on the firm side.

The room was spotless, and whilst there was a small amount of noise from aircraft we didn't find it intrusive. There was no noise from adjoining rooms (although we could faintly hear people speaking as they passed by our door).

There was no balcony or view from our window, but this was more than made up for by the very comfortable ""Club Lounge"" overlooking the pool and the large landscaped pool area. There were plenty of sun lounges ‚Ä¶ and we never saw more than 3 or 4 people using the area at the one time.

The staff were most friendly and we found the service to be first class. The dedicated Club Lounge staff were always on hand to assist with enquiries, internet access, and to serve up free coffee etc.

The free club lounge buffet breakfast was good and had a far greater selection than a normal continental breakfast.

We stayed one and a half days and although it was a little on the expensive side, it was ideal for breaking a long journey and we considered it good value for money.

If flying Singapore Airlines, you can check your luggage in at the hotel reception desk ‚Ä¶ but check the times as the hotel check-in closes at 3 or 4pm each day.

We would definitely stay there again.

The good? The rooms are great, large, very clean and modern. Room service is also great and staff friendly. The location is brilliant making this the perfect spot for an overnighter when you have an early flight. If you have more time, the train is fast and efficient into the city and just a stone's throw from the hotel. Convenience plus.

The bad? Not much at all. Noisy outside of your room from aircraft (but virtually undetectable inside the room). Expensive.... well everything. So take the short walk to the airport shops to get very cheap drinks and snacks. Don't drink in the bar - twice to three times Australian prices for beer.

The porters were timely, and the rooms are extremely spacious, as expected with 'out-of-the-way' hotels. Its proximity to Terminal 3 of Changi Airport makes it very handy for transitting passengers though. The porters will provide an airport trolley for luggage upon checkout.

Our room faced the communal pool, which was not audible from the 7th floor. However, voices of other hotel guests are easily heard from the common corridor. The lighting in the room was rather minimal too, given its size.

I reported the fault and it took half an hour for someone to come.  He said he would be back - he didn't until I called - after 2 or 3 more useless visits of various staff to our room, I had to march down to reception at 12.30am and demand to be moved immediately as we were extremely tired.  They finally moved us at around 12.45am.  I need to admit they did upgrade our room, however too little too late.  It was my birthday and it was a horrible end to a lovely day.On checkout, they also decided to charge us $9.45 for a local call (Hotel policy).Upon our return to Australia, I put in a complaint with the hotel via email (including their head office), looking for an explanation as to the lack of service and respect.  To this date, we have not received an explanation as to why we were treated this way - that was 4 weeks ago.  We had stayed in Singapore 2 weeks before that, and those hotels had already sent a Client Satisfaction survey to our home before I even got there - Crowne Plazza - still nothing......I recommend you stay somewhere else.........",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",18 ,14 ,2.0,

The hotel, as preiously noted is ultra-modern but appropriately stylish and not overly designed.  Very busy for obvious reasons (the airport).  I was not woken by the planes but I could see how light sleepers might be bothered.Did visit the pool area and walked by the gym (my key card would not open the gym for some reason) and they both appeared adequate.  Does appear that guests go to the pool to smoke at night (I think all rooms are non-smoking).  The bamboo forest / bamboo landscaping was a nice touch.  If you don't want to eat at the hotel there is a mall with a large food court in the basement of T3 (though finding a table during meal times was  frustrating to say the least).

I just got surprised by the additional charge for the breakfast. Could have been my mistake for not noticing when I booked that the room was without breakfast.

If your flight is in the wee hours of 4am, there is no sky train to take you to terminal 1 or 2. The airport shuttle is so infrequent, it's best not to wait for it. The best way to get to the other terminals is by taxi, about $10, the hotel can call for you. For those who are on transit, the transit hotel is definitely a better deal and most convenient. The reception at Crowne Plaza is very pleasant but I am qyite disappointed with the room. It's spacious and modern but not clean. There was a used cotton bud at the bathtub (see photo) ! We called and they send the personnel to come and remove it, even offered to clean up the bathtub. But i am already disappointed and definitely won't want to use the bathtub that day.

When we pointed out that it was an airport hotel and asked why we couldnt be accommodated earlier we were told that the cleaning staff did not start their shift until 9.00am and that our room would not be available until 2.00pm.  Thoroughly disgruntled we continued to complain, pointing out that most hotels manage at least a 12.00 noon check in time and they eventually capitulated and said they would get us into the room as soon as they could.  In order to speed up this process as much as possible we made makeshift beds of the chairs in the lounge/reception area and denied their offer of luggage stowage (we were flash-packing, i.e. backpacking but in some measure of style) so that we made the place look as untidy as possible.  Result was that they managed to get us into a room within an hour and a half.  The room itself was lovely with very modern decor.  If we hadnt had this experience with the check in then we would have been much happier with the hotel.  We understand that you cant make rooms available if people are still in them (as i recall the check out time was 10.00am) but feel that as it is an airport hotel and people come and go at all times of the day and night then it is totally unreasonable to have a check in time of 2.00pm.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Tignes, France",233 ,117 ,3.0,

Arrived 45 minutes before the restaurant closed to find them virtually set up for breakfast. So just ordered one course of steak (quick to cook, being British I don't like to be awkward). Unfortunately it was so overcooked it had to be returned (something I've only done twice in my life). For the price charged it was a mistake that shouldn't have happened.

Date of stay: November 2009,IntlSalesGuy,Unbeatable Convenience and Modern Amenities,"Stayed here for 2 separate nights while transiting through SE Asia. Booked a King Bed Deluxe room for both stays and was upgraded to King Bed Suites both times. (Platinum member)

I have stayed here in the past, but Priority Club status was not recognized at this hotel. Things have improved and they are much better now.

Check-in was fast and there was no wait at all. I've noticed that it is seldom busy here, which is good.

Room - The rooms are very modern and have nice furnishings. The King Suites are large, with a living area (with full work desk), half bath, mini bar area, bedroom, walk-in closet, and full bath. There are 2 LCD televisions with limited channels (mostly news and a few movies), digital telephone systems, and Bose radio. The bathroom has plenty of space and the best part is the huge rainforest shower head that dumps water on you.

Although the hotel is next to the runway and airplanes, there is minimal noise. You can hear the occasional take-off and landing, but it is not an issue.

Food - I did not try their restaurants or bars this time. I ended up eating inside the airport, as there are plenty of places to choose from.

Location - This is the best part of the hotel. Since it is attached to Terminal 3 of Changi Airport, it is extremely convenient to check-in for your flight (I fly United and Singapore Air). You can literally get from the hotel lobby to the airline check-in counters in about 5 minutes. Also, when arriving at Singapore, it takes about 5 minutes to walk from T3 immigration/customs to the hotel entrance. Either way, it is very convenient. As an added bonus, Changi Airport doubles as a shopping mall, with plenty of stores and restaurants to choose from.

The swimming pool is definitely uniquely designed and looked very inviting, although I did not have time to try it.

Overall, this is the best hotel if you're transiting through Singapore and want a nice place to relax before or after a long flight.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Phoenix, Arizona",299 ,106 ,,5.0

The room was spacious and quiet (much bigger than the hotel we had stayed in on Orchard Rd pre cruise) The bed was huge and luxurious, the large plasma screen tv had plenty of kid friendly channels, the bath was deep and big enough for all 3 of us, and it had a fantastic walk in shower with a rain head that was like standing in a warm torrential downpour (a real luxury to people from Australia suffering from water restrictions!) We had a lovely room service dinner and just wandered over to the aiport an hour before our flight was due to depart.
The room was modern in decor, with the bathroom wall made of perspex decorated with a hibiscus flower (you could watch telly from the bath - a personal favourite). The bed was super comfortable, and there was an ipod dock where I could charge my ipod before the flight.

Date of stay: October 2008,SydneyKeen_Traveller,Great airport hotel,"Stayed here 3 times (different trips) on transit in Singapore. Decided to delay reviewing the hotel to allow the hotel to ""settle down"" as it was only opened early this year.

My verdict is that this is the best airport hotel that I have stayed in to date (and I have stayed in quite a few in the last few years)!

Pros:

- large, well furnished and designed (rather funky in a way) 5 star rooms; plasma TV; DVD; Ipod docks; in draw safe; free chocolate cookies and mineral water
- large well equipped bathroom with rainwater shower and bath tub
- great location (esp for T3 but T1 and T2 are only seconds / minutes away on free and regular monorail service); 30 mins from city on MRT
- very friendly staff (overenthusiastic at times)
- adequate but good brand new gym facilities
- adequate F&B facilities; better still - quick access to landside F&B facilities at T3

Cons:

- not much except to make sure that you get a good price for the rooms (Singapore room prices have significantly gone up over the years)

Some reviewers have complained about plane noise. This has not been a problem to me at all (maybe I am a city person and have a rather high tolerance to ""noise""; the ""street noise"" level from my bedroom in Sydney is definitely higher than the room in the hotel) and I thought that the sound insulation was good and more than adequate for me. But don't expect 100% sound-proof rooms. In fact I prefer to stay in the rooms facing the runway as I quite enjoy looking at the aircraft comings and goings. If you are a light sleeper you should request rooms facing the street / entrance side of the hotel and if you can only sleep in zero decibel rooms then this hotel is not for you (the claustrophobic, smaller and lower quality transit hotel rooms in the airside area of Changi may be quieter but this is because they lack windows).

Another issue that may concern some people is that the walkways connecting the hotel rooms are not airconditioned (in fact open air (perforated walls) in parts - but thats part of the architectural design). Thus, walking to and from your rooms in the heat and humidity may be a rather strange / uncomfortable experience for some especially if you have just arrived from a cool climate country or have been too accustomed to the airconditioned spaces at Changi Airport.

Will definitely stay here again if transiting in Singapore.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Sydney, Australia",14 ,62 ,5.0,

Room reservations made a big foul up by telling me they can offer me a runway view room when such rooms are only applicable for king sized beds, (I wanted double bedded room)! In the end, it was a hassle to change rooms and go up and down the reception area to make the change. At the reception, service staff seemed to lack enough training before they started their jobs. The lady arranging for my room at the reception did not know the number to house-keeping and had to call the operator to check if the rooms were ready. In the late afternoon while I was resting in the room, a cleaning staff promptly opened my door and walked into my room without even knocking to check if anyone was in the room. How horrible was that! Noise from the aircraft did not bother me, it was pretty much minimal. Breakfast the next morning, was another nightmare. I asked for coffee and the staff poured one quarter of my cup and walked away leaving me clueless. She only emerged from the kitchen minutes later with another jug, but did not explain earlier that she will return to top up my cup.

,windowaisle,They got the details right but REALLY missed the big picture,"Have stayed twice. Yes, the rooms, restaurants and lobby are well designed and appointed, staff are courteous, fitness center is sufficient, and location is superb, particularly if using T3.

However, the hotel gets a rating of ""terrible"" for the most critically important aspect: noise. The very purpose of an airport hotel is sleep. Yet this is made difficult by the constant roar of aircraft taking off all night, even with earplugs. Having stayed in many airport hotels with similar proximity to the runway, the noise level was shocking, and a move to a different room provided almost no improvement. The transit hotels inside the terminals provide far, far better noise insulation.

1. 2 frosted windows with outside light in the room are impossible to screen so the room is not dark for sleeping.
2. the pool changing area has nowhere to put dry clothes while you change.
3. the pool lockers have a padlock and bizarrely you are given a cardboard paper with a complicated combination. There is nowhere to keep this dry while you swim. why not have a key that you can swim with? (I arrived on an early flight and was using the pool prior to check-in, so had valuables with me).
4. the beds are very hard for an international hotel.
5. the keycard is needed to activate the elevator by waving in front of a sensor but there are no instructions in the elevator and I witnessed confused guests on 2 occasions during my 1 night stay.
6. The check in area is poorly designed with a protruding shelf (which is presumably designed for bags) which forms a barrier between guests and staff. Guests stand awkwardly to the side of it to avoid it which is not ideal.
7. on arrival from terminal 2, a notice said airport trolleys must be left outside the hotel, but there was no way to get my heavy suitcase down to reception without the trolley and no staff around to help.

Date of stay: July 2008,Iluvtheoutdawz,Uber Chic!,"We recently stayed over at the new Crowne Plaza during a stopover en route to Malaysia.  The first thing that strikes you about the property is it's fantastic location, it is in terminal 2 on top of the Changi MRT and with access to a myriad of shops, cafe's and supermarkets.  Although we based our short stay at the airport we took the 20 minute train ride into Singapore proper to visit the main tourist attractions without any problems.  The hotel itself resembles something from the pages of Vogue, very impressive decor, the foyer sets the standard for the rest of the hotel with colourful modern furnishings and a glass roof that features a water cascade from the main pool.  The rooms themselves are equally impressive, although they are not huge they are very functional and with",,"Perth, Australia",182 ,251 ,,4.0
Date of stay: July 2008,Marc M.,"Cool, and brand-spanking new!","I stayed at the new Crowne Plaza Changi Airport for one night in late July. The hotel is brand spanking new, very modern, a mix of metal and glass that is easy on the eye. After a warm welcome and a smooth check-in, I went into my room and noticed it was facing the runway right off Terminal 3. Translation: lots of aircraft noise, at least potentially (it was nearly 10 PM by then and I had hardly slept over the previous 24 hours). Plus the in-room safe was malfunctioning. I went back to reception to ask for a quieter room and was promptly given the keys to room 636, facing Terminal 2 (which is further away and therefore means a much quieter experience). My room was tastefully done, a mix of modern and traditional in an Asian sense, a little like the rooms at the Parker Meridien",,Canada,174 ,180 ,4.0,

Date of stay: July 2008,lisa026,Great airport hotel,"Only had one night to stay before a flight the next day and I am actually sorry we had to leave. On arrival a staff member from them was waiting for us to assist us to the hotel and it was a lovely surprise. The hotel is actually right at the airport, we did not need to exit the airport area or cross the street. We got a very nice room, very modern and clean and the bed was very comfortable. We did take a look around the resturants, spa and pool area and it looked great. We were late tho so we had to use room service and it did not dissapoint. On departure they even assisted us all the way to check in. I wish all airport hotels would be like this.",,iceland,470 ,435 ,5.0,
Date of stay: July 2008,Iowa_Jim,"Nice location, check the hot water before unpacking","Great location, just off of Terminal 3. Nice place to overnight if you are in transit.  Room decor was fabulous.  But - no hot water in the shower. Did not realize this until the morning. The sink did have hot water, so it must just be a shower faucet setting. I would suggest you test out the shower temperature before unpacking, and if it is not hot, call the front desk and request a different room. This hotel just opened up about a month ago, so I suspect they have much to do yet before everything is perfect.  24 hours for internet is $38 USD. Ouch. But what are you going to do?  I rated this above average due to the convenient location for transit.",,"Des Moines, Iowa",1 ,,4.0,
Date of stay: July 2008,TravellinAfrican,Ok,"Stayed for 1 night. The rooms look great but for some reason they aren't that comfortable. The bed was very hard, and the water was only warm - it was impossible to have a properly hot bath. The whole hotel was very dark, and a bit lifeless at this stage. I think this will improve when it opens properly (eg the non-lobby  bar is still under construction).   Overall I would say it was stylish but lacking in substance, and, like all hotels in Singapore, overpriced. I would stay again on a 1 night stopover, purely because there is no other hotel connected to the terminal outside the transit area. It is, no doubt about it, very convenient.",,Solomon Islands,34 ,71 ,,2.0

Found the hotel hard to get too initially but as soon as i was given directions it was right there and the entrance was in the terminal.  Location ‚Äì the location is great for an overnight stay. Even if you are there for a day you can take the MRT (tube) into town in about 30 mins for $SDG 2.5  Rooms ‚Äì really beautiful, the bathroom was amazing. Could not fault it what so ever.

Date of stay: June 2008,L0ve2Travel2008,My new favorite place to stay!,"I decided to book this hotel to stay our last 2 nights in Singapore as it is located at Terminal 3 and I'm VERY happy I decided to stay!  Although the hotel was not completely open the level of service was great, from the personalised in-room checkin for Priority Club members to the room service meals i ordered to the meals in the restaurant.   The design of this hotel warrants at least 1 night for those interested in a unique experience.  From the use of metal, light, water and natural products, this hotel really made me want to explore and see what else I could find.  I had a room that looked out over the terminal and several gates...I understand the Airbus 380 parks at one of the gates in front of the hotel but I was not in my room to see it personally.

Date of stay: June 2008,Dan A,I cannot belive this hotel is this lousy!  Really!,"You would think that the Crowne Plaza line would have some real consistency, right?  And you'd think that anything in Singapore would have top notch service, right?  And certainly something associated with Changi's T3 would be world class, right?  And being a Priority Club Platinum member the experience should be great, right?  Well, if you said yes to any of these, you'd be wrong....... like I was.  Let me explain....     I arrived about 1:30 pm and frankly the first thing that struck me was how dark (foreboding?) the entrance is coming in from cheery T3.  But no matter, I knew that things would be great once I got situation.  What?  Room not ready?  No worries, I wait 30 minutes and a helpful young lady says room 629 was ready, and here was my key.  The bellman was helpful to carry my bags up, and life seemed good.    Walking to the room, I was reminded of a 1960's type motel.  The hallway was exposed, and frankly, all of the concrete and black and brown sheet metal really seemed cheap.  In fact, the cast iron ""bars"" that surrounded the facade added to the ""cheap"" feel.  But no matter, off to a shower and a nice bed.    What?  Door was bolted on 629?  The doorman knocked on the door, and finally a young lady answered.  Unfortunately, she was not my wife and probably wouldn't take kindly to sharing a room.  So the bellman runs back to the front desk, leaving me and my luggage in the hallway for another 20 minutes.      OK, new room 644.  OK, thanks.  Now to be fair, the room was OK, not overly warm, but OK.  Bed was decent, and they did have a nice LCD TV and I-pod docking station.    Shower time.  Hmmm, nice shampoo, but what's this-no hot water?  Brrr..  OK, forget it, I'll try in the morning.    Zooooooom Zoooooom planes sure run late here at Changi, but it's 6 am and time for my nice hot shower.  But what?  No hot water again?       That's it, I'm checking out.  Yes, I left my key card up in the room.  Yes, really I did.  If you need to charge me for it, send someone up to check I can't get in again.  Yes, really I left it there.    Seriously folks, they blew it with this property.  Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out, but really as cheap and dark as this place feels you woudl be much better off to spend the S$3 on a train ride into town.  For S$300 you'll get a much better deal at the Conrad, HI Atrium, or even the old HI Parkview.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Winterset, Iowa",81 ,65 ,1.0,
Date of stay: June 2008,ExtremeJ,A Little slice of Heaven,"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for one night after four weeks in Europe on the way home to Australia to break the flight.  The hotel is situated right at Changi Airport. What a delight.  The hotel had only been open three weeks and it was wonderful.  The room was spacious, clean and I didn't move from it. I ordered in room service for dinner which was delicious, luxuriated in the large deep bath and slept soundly in the huge comfortable bed. I hightly recommend this hotel for a stopover from Australia-London-Australia, if you want to break the long flight for a rest.  It is about a 30 minute cab ride to the city centre if you want to shop.  The breakfast was outstanding as well. The service exemplary.",Trip type: Travelled with family,Australia,1 ,3 ,5.0,

The hotel is located in Terminal 3 (note that you do need to go thru customs to get to it).  It also has a pool/gym, restaurant, lounge and bar/club.
