It was a brief chat as we were heading off. We were taken by surprise when he remembered us and even remembered what we chat about then.

129,puttyland,"Convenient location, great price","Enjoyed our stay here - big room, nice decor, and easy to walk to the major sights.  We ate at the two nearby hawker centers for most breakfasts and lunches - fantastic range of food.  The staff were helpful, but sometimes a bit overwhelmed during check-in.  The bartender was almost never at the bar,  which was disappointing, but the front desk guy showed us a local place to get kaya toast and coffee.

147,Gourav Sharma,Not recommended,"Location:
If you are a vegetarian or enjoy Indian cuisine, you may find it convenient to book a hotel near the Little India market. However, if you prefer other types of food, it may be more cost-effective to book a hotel near Santosa to avoid daily commute expenses.

Room:
We found that the standard rooms were more comfortable than the premier rooms, so we decided to downgrade our booking(in the same cost). The premier rooms are located in a separate building and lack a pleasant ambiance. Additionally, we were informed that room service is currently unavailable due to limited staffing

Cost:
The cost charged by the hotel does not justify the lack of room service and the subpar quality of their food. Additionally, we were disappointed to learn that they charge an extra fee of $23 per hour for early check-in.

Food:
I suggest not to include dinner in your booking as the breakfast provided had limited options and was below average in taste.

It was very accesible staying in between Rochor MRT and Little india MRT as well as bus stops around the area. The room we stayed in was very spacious and had the basic amenities. the hotel looked more on hispanic era which gives off vintage vibes and was very pleasant in photos. During our wedding, the staff really accommodates us the best way they can. Even granted us some of our requests. We really had a very pleasant stay all throughout.

421,Vasily_Pr,Disappointing,"I love Village hotels, each of them has its charm. However, this particular property requires an immediate upgrade and also a different approach from the management.  1) They do renovations while having staying in house. Good properties close a wing for refurbishment then open once all works completed. In Village hotel guests see empty fountains, lifts under renovation and it’s constant.   2) The 2nd wing rooms are disaster. My washbasin was clogged so I had to decide not to shave, it was filling up to the top very fast. There was also water on a floor coming from somewhere (I didn’t use shower all day and there was water). The building has aircon machines on its roof creating noise and vibration in upstairs rooms.

- Location (10mins walking distance to Mustafa, A2B and Komala Vilas, Khansama Tandoori and Pakistani Restaurants, 1-2 min walking distance to 7Eleven Shop and Little India MRT and Rocher MRT, 4-5 mins walking distance to SIM LIM Square).
- Staffs were friendly and courteous. Siva was our guest service incharge while checking in
- American Buffet Breakfast (they serve few Indian food like Vada, Idly, Rava Upma). Vegetarians will like this place, for eggetarian and meat eaters it is only eggs and sausages)
- Just outside the hotel you will find Italian, Indian restaurants and few beer joints.
What we did not like
- We stayed in Room# 211 (corner and odd dimensional room). We requested for change and they denied our request. (Do NOT go by the pictures of the room, the rooms are very small)

438,Sahil A,"Pleasant Stay, Courteous & Helpful Staff, Very Good Location","We booked 2 rooms here from 16th August to 21st August 2019. Check-in was normal, Jana was at the desk and helped us with the room keys. Our luggage was brought to the rooms by the staff. Rooms on the 6th Floor are worth it, for the view and for being quiet. They brought in the extra bed, as requested for 1 room. The other room was not ready at that time, but was available in the next 10 minutes.

Went into the second room and were suprised to see a queen bed in there. It was way too small for us to accomodate. Went in back on the reception and requested Jana. She understood our plea as we were with a child and offered us the king room adjacent to our first one, but from the next day. This came in as a respite. We somehow managed the first night. Second day, our room was shifted to the bigger one and we were more than happy.

Beds were good, matresses were very comfortable and were good for our backs. Cleaniness was at par. The toiletries could have been a lot better though. You can add a separate hair conditioner bottle to it. The lifts need an upgrade. The card readers are not upto the mark and most of the times we had to swipe them about 10 times to get it to work. The door closing action is sluggish. I am sure you will have something planned for it already as the permit expires on 30th September 2019.

Tap water is safe to drink, however, the glasses provided inside the washroom are too small and can be mistaken for denture glasses. I had to double check with the reception. Tea and coffee trays are fine. In the hot and humid weather, one would expect cold water to be available in the room. But you have toe either buy the bottles form them, or fill up the bottles from tap and keep them in refrigerator for hours to get them cold.

Breakfast spread is very good. The breakfast lobby is a bit small, but arrangement of buffets is great considering the space they have. Quality of food is very very good. The staff is courteous, takes requests and helps you. Fresh fruit and salad counters are the best part.

Hotel is a stone throw distance away from Bugis, Little India, Sim Lim Square, Rochor MRT and you can go anywhere from here easily. They have cafe's right at the entrance, a microbrewery, indian food resturant, all of them with happy hours. Orchard road is about 2 kms walk from here.

A special mention for Jocelyn, she was very helpful to us and went the extra mile to get us a taxi quickly when our transfer guy did not turn up at the hotel. She even helped change our rooms and did everything with a big smile. Big thumbs up to her.

Checkout was good too. They safeguarded our luggage for hours. Siva is a great and helpful guy at the frontdesk.

Check-in was normal, Jana was at the desk and helped us with the room keys. Our luggage was brought to the rooms by the staff. Rooms on the 6th Floor are worth it, for the view and for being quiet. They brought in the extra bed, as requested for 1 room. The other room was not ready at that time, but was available in the next 10 minutes.

Went into the second room and were suprised to see a queen bed in there. It was way too small for us to accomodate. Went in back on the reception and requested Jana. She understood our plea as we were with a child and offered us the king room adjacent to our first one, but from the next day. This came in as a respite. We somehow managed the first night. Second day, our room was shifted to the bigger one and we were more than happy.

Beds were good, matresses were very comfortable and were good for our backs. Cleaniness was at par. The toiletries could have been a lot better though. You can add a separate hair conditioner bottle to it. The lifts need an upgrade. The card readers are not upto the mark and most of the times we had to swipe them about 10 times to get it to work. The door closing action is sluggish. I am sure you will have something planned for it already as the permit expires on 30th September 2019.

Tap water is safe to drink, however, the glasses provided inside the washroom are too small and can be mistaken for denture glasses. I had to double check with the reception. Tea and coffee trays are fine. In the hot and humid weather, one would expect cold water to be available in the room. But you have toe either buy the bottles form them, or fill up the bottles from tap and keep them in refrigerator for hours to get them cold.

Breakfast spread is very good. The breakfast lobby is a bit small, but arrangement of buffets is great considering the space they have. Quality of food is very very good. The staff is courteous, takes requests and helps you. Fresh fruit and salad counters are the best part.

Hotel is a stone throw distance away from Bugis, Little India, Sim Lim Square, Rochor MRT and you can go anywhere from here easily. They have cafe's right at the entrance, a microbrewery, indian food resturant, all of them with happy hours. Orchard road is about 2 kms walk from here.

A special mention for Jocelyn, she was very helpful to us and went the extra mile to get us a taxi quickly when our transfer guy did not turn up at the hotel. She even helped change our rooms and did everything with a big smile. Big thumbs up to her.

Checkout was good too. They safeguarded our luggage for hours. Siva is a great and helpful guy at the frontdesk.

All in all, it's a very good hotel to stay at. Albeit the rooms are renovated, this being a colonial architecutre hotel, feels a bit dated. I am sure, this can be taken care of in the time to come.

510,Sean Tan,Relaxing & Memorable Staycation Experience,"Firstly, I had stayed at this hotel from 15 to 16 June 2019 and booked my hotel room through the official hotel website which allows me to enjoy special member rates which are lower than those rates being offered at other booking websites.

Secondly, the staff member who had helped me with checking into my hotel room is very professional and friendly. He had kindly given me a free room upgrade from a superior room to a club room which is an extremely pleasant surprise for me. When another guest had shamelessly tried to cut into my queue, he had also kindly advised him to join in the queue behind me instead. As such, the check in process for me was fast and seamless without any precious time being wasted.

Lastly, the hotel room which I had stayed in was specklessly clean and tidy and the bed was also very soft and comfortable to sleep in until I had spent most of my time in my hotel room. Everything from both the iron and ironing board especially for business travellers to the hair dryer and safe were being provided during my stay there. As such, I was able to pack light for my staycation and didn't have to worry about not having my necessities around with me.

520,CTC5118,Hotel is good but staff need to improve,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, booked 3 rooms. While the hotel is good, the staff at the front office seriously lack of customer service. The staff who serve me named Jona. We came in at 3.30pm to check -in just to be informed that the rooms is not ready though their check in time is 2.00pm. when I asked her why, the reply I got was so sarcastic, ""we can't clean all the rooms at the same time"" so I was told to wait . Even after informing that through email 1 week before coming. eventually we were given different rooms in different floor, so early notice did not make any difference to this people.

614,DevonMothball,Good location,"The hotel is in a very good location , near the underground station , which I cannot rave about enough , clean and so easy to use , to get around the city .  The reception staff we a little cold to us when we arrived . (I do wish people would think , these guest have been in a plane for 20 hours , lets smile at them ! )  The first room we had was not good , overlooking a tiny yard , so I paid to up grade . The up graded room was nothing special in my opinion , but it was bigger . The bath was very difficult to get in as it's built into a tiled frame .

Further indian veg breakfast didnot consist of normal options. Who eats roti sabji, or veg roce in breakfast?? Sabji also tasted like hell.   Plz improve taste of veg breakfast by hiring some indian cooks having authentic indian taste. Keep veg section seperate n away from non veg as there was big hall of dining.

1193,jav020156,Dirty furniture and dirty chef's uniform,"Paid s$50/ night extra for a club family room for 3 adults.. Was offered a room on the ground floor of the annex. This had a king bed only with an old, stained, small sofa. Was informed that a roll in single bed would also be provided and this was rolled in. This was ancient and totally unsuitable for an adult. Not what we had requested.

We complained and were told by Mr Syed Ali Bin Syed that this club room was bigger than a family room (not true) and that no other rooms were available. Shortly after, a room on the first floor of the annex became available and we accepted it.

Furniture old, bathroom showing it's age. This hotel is acceptable but definitely not a 4 star hotel.

Breakfast was forgettable. Poor choice and crowded. No tea bags available. Tea made in a pot sitting in a hot plate. Presumably to save on tea bags.

This was ancient and totally unsuitable for an adult. Not what we had requested.

We complained and were told by Mr Syed Ali Bin Syed that this club room was bigger than a family room (not true) and that no other rooms were available. Shortly after, a room on the first floor of the annex became available and we accepted it.

Furniture old, bathroom showing it's age. This hotel is acceptable but definitely not a 4 star hotel.

1513,suesalford,Very convenient hotel for a 2 day stopover ,"Been to Singapore a few times, so chose this hotel because it was in a different location but extremely convenient for the Little India and Rocher metro stations ( which are very easy to use). Got the hotel shuttle bus from Changi airport at $9 each and although it too a while, about 50 mins, it was easy and got the baggage there. Although the taxi back was only $18 anyway!

1561,PraveensView,A good place to stay in!,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week of December 2016 with extended family. Hotel is compact and comfortable. The rooms, though very clean, seem a little bare and empty, probably because of the high ceiling. And some of the rooms have very small windows. So not much in terms of outside views. Bedding was very good and comfortable. Linens clean. Bathrooms clean and equipped with basic toiletries. The bathtub in one of our rooms looked old and stained and the water was not draining properly (had to pull out the drain plug to let the water drain fully). No issues otherwise.

Service was excellent. Any requests were handled promptly. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a tour desk too where they can help out with any sightseeing queries. You can buy tickets to the attractions directly there itself, without having to wait in the queue at the venue. Very helpful and time saving!

Buffet Breakfast was good with a nice range of choices, including an omelette station. The dining area is a bit crowded though. It was difficult to get a place to sit in the ""peak"" hours and had to wait for a table both the mornings.

Location wise, it is about 20 minutes from Changi and costs about 20 to 25 SGD to reach. Little India is a 5 minute walk. A few restaurants are right outside the hotel in Village Square. And a couple more just around the corner of the street. If looking for South Indian food, Ananda Bhavan in Little India is just a short 5 to 10 minute walk.

Though we did not take MRT from the hotel, Rochor subway station seems to be very close. Little India station is a little farther away than Rochor, but both within a short walk. If you have not traveled by Singapore MRT, it is the best way to get around the city. Fast and efficient and close to most of the attractions.

As this was my first hotel stay in Singapore, I don't know if the services and facilities are at par with other hotels here in the same price range, but it is definitely a nice play to stay with good facilities and service.

1569,NidhiChawla,Good Location... Poor Service,"The location of Hotel is good (near Little India and Bugis). The check in was fast, however the hotel lacks the hospitality. The room service is very very slow.

1. Day 1 : the room we checked in was very small. We had requested for a King bed as we were travelling with a kid. We ended up getting a room with a queen bed as the hotel informed that they dont have King beds...

OK... We requested for an extra bed, obviously on payment basis... We had to follow up 2-3 times over 3-4 hours, after which we were informed that Extra bed cant fit in our room. We were finally offered a room where in the extra bed can fit but were informed that extra bed is only available for 2 days in our 3 day stay! We had no choice but to agree!

2. Day 2: we left in the morning around 10 AM and requested for the room to be cleaned. At about 3 Pm when we returned, the room was not cleaned yet! We ordered Sandwiches from the restaurant and the guy initially refused saying ""You have not given deposit"" ... Agreed i had not given deposit, but nobody had even asked me nor had i refused payment! Makes me wonder of the service orientation... Finally when the sandwich was delivered , a 9$ sandwich costed me 15$ ($6 service charge!!!!!)

3. Day3: Again getting the room cleaned meant 2-3 follow ups and then an escalation to the reception!

1698,Allan N,"Nice Hotel, Great Location, Disappointing Room Size","Based on TripAdvisor reviews I selected this hotel for my 6 night stay in Singapore.

The hotel is in a great location, just 5 min walk from Rochor MRT Station and the Little India quarter. The staff here are excellent (well groomed, polite, very attentive and helpful). The site itself is clean, tidy and well presented. There are a number of restaurants adjacent to the hotel and the Hospoda Czech Microbrewery which serves wonderful icy cold beer (a Godsend after wandering Singapore in the heat and humidity all day).

The hotel itself has a bar and a restaurant, however I chose to eat and drink at hawker centres and bars elsewhere. I did have breakfast at the hotel one morning and found it disappointing for the price.

My room was clean, well appointed and reasonably quiet. Two small bottles of water were provided each day when the room was serviced.

On the down side... the room was extremely small for the tariff paid (in comparison to other places I have stayed both in Singapore and around the world, and in comparison to the photos on the hotels website). The refrigerator in the room was nothing short of useless and the air-conditioning was always freezing (despite what temperature I set it at). The water pressure in the shower was poor and the mixer tap contrary. One day I decided to take a nice hot relaxing bath and it took the best part of an hour to run enough water to 2/3 fill the bath.

As I was travelling solo and spending most of my time out and about I accepted that the room was adequate for my needs, despite my disappointment in relation to value for money paid.

1935,saveyourwork,Reasonable price at a very central location,"I am impressed in every aspect of this hotel, given the price that it offers.

First the location is magnificent. It is less than 5 mins walk to nearest mrt and it can connect you to anywhere including city hall and orchard road. Bugis is just nearly, within walking distance and it is a good heaven! Make sure you visit the local food court (without air conditioned).

The furniture is a bit dated but I am not too concern about that.

The customer service is excellent, thanks to the guy that book my taxi on my way back and every enquiry was responded well. The cleaner was very polite when asking if I would like to make the bed.

One thing I did notice though, perhaps it was the construction site nearby, every now and then, I can feel the floor was trembling slightly. Happened few times a day. Just a small concern that prevent me from giving 5 stars

1948,DNR,Fantastic stay,"The check in was very smooth,it hardly took ten min . Thanks to the staff .Located just couple of mins walk from two MRT stations ( little India and Roacher station). It takes just ten minutes by MRT to reach Sentosa and 15 min by taxi to Singapore flyer. Taxi stand is also just 2 min walk from the hotel.or else one can even book taxi through hotel front desk.Vegetarians have great food options around this hotel as its near Little India. Rooms are clean and promptly serviced daily. Sleep quality was also great .

1982,Kym_from_Perth,Interesting location right near Little India!,"We enjoyed our stay at the Village Hotel. Stayed over 6 nights, including the Formula One weekend in September.
Our first trip to Singapore for the purpose of seeing the GP. Weren't too keen on staying on the Marina or near Orchard Road. Not really our scene. Prefer something a bit more 'local' in its atmosphere. We weren't let down. Easy to get to other parts of the city (only 5 mins walk to Little India station) and will probably be even easier when they finish the new subway connections next to the hotel.
Room was big enough for 6 nights. Not exactly enormous, but then we didn't order a huge suite or anything.
Breakfast was fine. Got a bit repetitive after 6 nights and we ended up going out for breakfast in Little India a couple of days (Kopi, kaya toast and soft boiled eggs, do it!)
We liked being able to walk about Little India, lots of great people watching and excellent places to eat there. Arab St is a walkable distance too, as is Bugis and the National Gallery/Bras Basah area (unless you get really hot, really quickly, then use the subway/taxi).
Albert St also has a big hawkers down the road and its own little Chinatown.
Location was fab!
The hotel itself was fine. I mean, hotels don't usually wow me. We prefer smaller B&Bs and AirBNB usually.

2186,SandeepKPune,Never stay in this hotel,"I had stayed in this hotel from 6th May till 12th May 15. To ensure I get what I need; I have done booking directly on their website and booked a family room with three separate beds and also got the confirmation from them. I was really enthused when I received a mail from the hotel manger that he will be responsible to make my stay comfortable. He asked me for room location preference, food requirements, arrival time etc. Subsequent to that I requested for a room on ""higher floor with good view"".
However nothing has gone right from the moment, I stepped in this hotel. I was travelling with my old mother and wife but nobody even bothered to help us with our luggage to lobby and then room. While checking in lady at front desk refused me the room which I had booked i.e. room with three separate beds as it was already given to someone. I could even see her changing already allotted room number on my record sheet. When I tried to reason out with my reservation details, she told that rooms are allotted based on availability and you are late. In such case, it does not make any sense to pay & reserve room in advance. Even it was a great joke to ask for room location preference, arrival time-flight details etc. The room was a big disappointment. It was dark and gloomy place on ground floor (Room 101) with absolutely no view. The room cleanliness was horrible especially washroom. I could see uncleaned toilet floor. Sofa in the room was absolutely worth replacing. Remote control of the TV was not working though we hardly watched any channels. This hotel is not worth of money being spent. Complementary breakfast menu for all 5 days of our stay was more or less same with very limited options.
When I complained over mail to manager regarding room allocation, he tried to pacify me with a drink but we could not meet due to mismatch of our schedules and no special efforts from him.
My room was also not cleaned properly during my stay which we could easily make out. Finally I decided to ignore as it was taking toll on my holiday. We spent most our time outside and used the room only to sleep in the night. Especially my wife was very upset with the responses from your staff and cleanliness of the room. I had stayed in other parts of the world but never experience such low quality of service. They are least cared about the customer experience and probably never want repeat customer.

2205,Bob H,To be close to Little India and Bugis excellent.,"We stayed at the Albert Court twice in a fortnight en route to Australia, and again on the homeward leg. The hotel is ideally situated for exploring the Little India area of Singapore, and the area around Bugis Junction. It is very handy for the MRT, being midway between Little India and Bugis, but there is a new station planned at Rochor Canal which is almost next door.

2225,ClaudiaFDias,Very poor,"I got this hotel with a good rate when it was difficult to find available rooms in the region. Good discount in Expedia. Since it is from the same group of Village Katong I've stayed and enjoyed, I was expecting the same. but not. The first room was smelly. We change, ok. The room (the hotel in general) is old and not very well conservated.
