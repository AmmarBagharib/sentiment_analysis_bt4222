couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Privacy issues a concern Our stay at the Village Hotel in Changi was OK.  I will summarise as follows:  Positives:  The room itself had everything we needed in the right place ‚Äì sockets by the bed, a mirror, a small fridge, hairdryer and plenty of storage space.  A seating area by the window so you can watch the aeroplanes come in if you are so inclined.  Our room had a nice view out to sea but not all rooms have this.   Bed was comfortable.   Good location for the excellent Hawker Centre (generally most stalls close around 8 pm) and the bum boats to Pulau Ubin.  Plenty of buses around if you want to venture further away.  Negatives:  We waited about 20 minutes in the check-in queue, and it‚Äôs not surprising as each check-in took ages.  I don‚Äôt know what needed to be done that took so long.

,2.0,True,Negative,So much potential but so misleading. It‚Äôs such a shame would love to have seen it when it was good. Where do I start? It‚Äôs very shabby. Needs a LOT of love. Was a Covid hotel apparently. Does not appear to have been well renovated afterwards. No airport shuttle as advertised. No bar or restaurant or club lounge with cocktails no mini mart all as advertised. Pools are amazing. Best thing about the hotel. There were ants in my bed although the hotel seems clean. No milk in the rooms just powdered milk. Wifi in the rooms is dubious at best very intermittent. In lobby and at pools it is excellent.  It‚Äôs just shabby. The walls outside need painting it needs routine maintenance. The glass around the pool is covered in lime scale so you can hardly see out it. It has the potential to be an absolutely top notch hotel just beautiful but it‚Äôs just not. It‚Äôs sad.  The hawker markets next,2023-09-01,PostCovid,0

Due to the lack of restaurant - which is under renovation - breakfast seemed to be a catered affair but very plain. All of the food stations had been let to go cold - no one had ensured the heating lights under the food stations were replenished.

couple,,False,,"Love the place, but enough is enough. Sort your WIFI or downgrade yourself to a budget hotel There are good reasons for staying at the Changi Village:
- The area is absolutely lovely. You can walk, run, or bike for miles on the Beach Park
- If you love local authentic food you are in for a treat
- The ferry for Pulau Ubin is steps away. Pulau Ubin is one of the best ""day out"" away from Singapore. It is an island where time has stopped.
- The hotel is nice (with one big exception), and the staff as always is great.

And then there are some reasons not to stay here:
- The Changi Village area, while lovely, is remote (by Singapore standards). It is not connected to the metro, and you will need to catch a bus or a taxi to the city.
- It is also not that convenient for the airport. Despite sharing a name, the hotel (and the village) sits opposite the airport. Taxis (and you can only get here by taxi) have to go around the entire airport perimeter, plus the Air Force Base. Late at night, with 0 traffic, it will still take about 20 minutes to reach the hotel and a Grab car you set you back around 28 SGD. Since COVID there is no longer a shuttle. It is not the end of the world, but don't expect this to be a traditional airport hotel, one that you jump into a shuttle and is checking in 10 minutes later.
- BUT, the one reason not to stay here is the WIFI. Now, this may not apply to you; you might be really on vacations, and in this case, by all means come. The hotel is nice enough. Clean, airy and ""large"" rooms, some with great views, and a nice pool at the top. But the WIFI sucks so badly, that to say they offer complimentary wifi is a joke.

Quality is definitely WORSE than budget hotel, and it is not worth it at all for the price paid. Was expecting it to be quite a good hotel for the price, really disppointed.

Will never stay here again, and will never recommend this to anyone to not spoil their mood.

Walls are thin, could hear my inconsiderate neighbour opening and slamming the door all the time with their loud tv. Beds were hard and springy.

We went for our swim and came back 2hrs later and it was properly cleaned.

Rooms were dated. The toilet looks dated as well. The beds at the bottom sides have mould on it. Perhaps due to moistures.

For a one night stay at the price, it's decent enough. But it certainly needs an overhaul soon.

Abundance of food around the hotel from nonya to Malay to Indian and western dishes. Many dim sum and Chinese food as well. Dim sum restaurant next door opens as early as 630am so it's good for those who doesn't have buffet breakfast.

,,False,,"Stayed at the Changi Village Hotel in March 2018 and again in November 2019 I'm a retired airline pilot and have, as a result, stayed in numerous hotels around the World.
As far as I am aware, this hotel was originally a Le Meridien which opened in 1985.
Following an economic recession, Far East Organization assumed ownership of the hotel in 1989.

The hotel is now in need of some TLC to bring its fabric up to the original standard. External walls and windows suffer from discolouration due to algae or moulds and the Koi pond on the 6th floor could do with some attention.
If you want a view of any sort, choose a room with a balcony.

The hotel appears to attract people on a budget from all of the surrounding cultures and from Europe, Australia and the USA.

On our latest visit we chose the Club Room King Bed option. This includes 6th floor Club lounge access with daily breakfast, all day soft drinks and two hours of evening cocktails, beer and wines with a selection of buffet food. Two nights with a late check-out of 1900 instead of 1200 cost us SGD $481. That covered all food in the Club Lounge and copious evening G&T, beer and wine drinks. My wife says that Benjamin mixes a better G&T than I do.

Transfer to the hotels is from Terminal 2 and it takes about 15 minutes on this occasion though we had just missed the transfer bus so instead of waiting an hour got a taxi which was only 15 SGD

I had booked a room that gave access to the club lounge so when we arrived earlier than the official check in time we were given access to the lounge until our room was ready.
On entering the lounge we were greeted to nibbles, soft drinks and coffee/tea making facilities.
We sat on the balcony of the premier lounge with a cold drink and in a relatively short space of time our room was ready for us.
We went to our room which had everything we needed for our stay, unpacked and went back to the lounge to be met by Ben who introduced himself to us.
It was soon time for evening food and drinks during happy hour 6pm - 8pm(both western and local foods were on offer) and again Ben and the team were keen to ensure you were well looked after both food and drinks wise which was very nice to see.
Ben and the team also advised on things to do locally to get the best out of our stay.
I particularily liked the fact that the team greeted everyone of their customers by name on arrival to the lounge.
The hotel has a pool on the roof which was lovely especially in the warm weather and sun loungers to allow you to relax.
We ventured to the nearby coastal beach for a walk... we must have been mad as it was roasting hot but on the way back stopped off at the Hawker Centre for something to eat and drink.
We had arranged for a late check out as our flight wasnt till the early hours the following morning.
Check out was another painless exercise and again the service received was second to none.
So to summarise a great hotel and location and if you get a chance to use the lounge area then Ben and the team will ensure you are well looked.

It is however, disappointing when we first step in. The customer service lady, Nasihah, is definitely not suited for her job at the fronk desk. We felt totally unwelcome and there was no attempt to even make a little forceful smile. Our engagement to make a conversation with her was really badly received. No attempt to explain to us about any services of the hotel such as the 1h complimentary bicycle ride nor the airport transfer. A total nonchalant look on her face told us to leave. (I took notice of her service towards others and luckily, it was consistent and not targeted towards us). If this is the service standard of a senior associate, the hotel might really want to take a look at staff training. The room was even more disappointing where you can see the corroded and dirty bathtub. Left over chips were placed in the cabinet. I have attached photos as evidence. We wanted to make a feedback to the front desk but guess what? The intercomm buttons were all not working!! Maybe thats a subtle way to tell us that we dont expect much services from the hotel.

However, the chambermaid, Ivy, managed to save our day with her friendliness and proactiveness to assist us in our request. Another saving grace from the hotel was another staff called Justin who was patience and polite in answering our question when we asked about the airport transfer.

All in all, the location of the hotel is fantastic with its proximity to the changi beach and food center. With the 1h bike rental and airport shuttle, it really adds on to character of the hotel, to live like a local.

The buffet breakfast was a bit of a letdown but I am very fond of bacon, haha (they don't have any).

After a long flight, waiting for check-in is hard, so I think the staff need to address this.

My room is the Club Room King Bed which comes with many benefits but below are some of the unique ones (applicable if book directly with the hotel):



What I enjoyed most was the club lounge, although it is not very big, the layout is spaciously comfortable to enjoy your meals. Breakfast, though the varieties are not extensive like a usual buffet but is sufficient for a decent and nutritious breakfast (salad, cold cuts, fruits, hot food, pastries, etc). During the day, light snacks & refreshment are also provided with some pastries, snacks and tidbits. For evening cocktails, varieties are not extensive but is good enough for a sumptuous dinner and most of all, they do serve wine/hard liquor. The ambience during the dinner is delightful, as such my gf and I had a great 2hrs time without realizing, all thanks to Benjamin for his excellent service and warm hospitality.



The room is spacious and clean so is the bathroom. My room comes with a balcony with a great view overlooking the sea. The bed is amazingly comfortable and soft. The room has all the usual necessities of a hotel. WIFI is strong and fast.



The hotel has 2 swimming pools, one is at level 1 and the other one is at level 8 which is an ‚ÄúInfinity‚Äù pool with a sea view where you can catch the sun rise and there is also a jacuzzi as well. There is a very well equipped gym. The hotel also provides 2 way shuttle bus service to the airport. The hotel is a stone's throw away from the beach. There is a bowling center opposite the hotel. There is a hawker center with many famous local delights just minutes away.



Overall, the hotel is a good choice for staycation to enjoy tranquility and peace away from the city. My gf and I had a great time and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly at the hotel. Will definitely be back again. Kudos to Changi Village Hotel!",2019-10-01,PreCovid,0

family,,False,,"Tired hotel that needs a change Booked 2 nights in the executive suite for a staycation. For close to 400 dollars a night, the executive suite was not worth it.

Room
The executive suite I was given was shaped very oddly and I asked for a baby cot and the baby cot could not fit into the main bedroom as the doorway to the main bedroom was too narrow. Was I expected to let my baby sleep in the living room? This should have been mentioned somewhere that the baby cot will have to be placed in the living room.

The room was rather tired and could do with some refurbishing especially since it‚Äôs a executive suite. There was ants running around on the work table and furniture looked dated. Nothing luxurious about the suite, except that it‚Äôs really big with a lot of space. Shower was decent (but cigarette smell lingers in the bathroom) and the bed was average.

Executive lounge
One good thing about booking the suite / club room is the use of the lounge which provided drinks / snacks which was good. The variety of food / drinks was decent and cocktail hour was decent too.

Club room also meant late checkout which was great.

Staff
Staff were friendly and very helpful and items that I requested for are delivered promptly. Front desk staff might need to be better trained as one of them didn‚Äôt know that club room has late checkout and told me that I need to checkout by 12. One staff that I would like to commendate is the lady at front desk on 1october around 12-1230 (her name starts with S), she was professional and very friendly.

In summary, it might not be worthwhile getting an executive suite if you don‚Äôt need space, a club room will do.",2019-10-01,PreCovid,1

The best part, besides the convenience/shuttle, was the Japanese restaurant. Good food and service and a great sake happy hour deal. (Actually, drink prices and much of the food was decent value for SG. But, you can walk a few steps and have tons of other choices too.)

While the transport network around Sentosa is excellent we hardly used it. We were in walking distance of Universal Studios, The Beach, The Luge , The Zipline in fact everything was right on our doorstep. As we checked in ( all rather efficient ) we headed to our family room - after staying with the kids in the same room , having a seperate room for them really made the difference. They could sleep early while i could be awake in the next room. They could watch their cartoons , play in their room and also enjoy their privacy. It was easy to lock their room so they were safe and we left the door open between our rooms. My kids wake early so breakfast was not a problem and the choice was fantastic. Both boys loved walking around the buffet and coming back with treats. The other added bonus is the sweet cart in reception, it was nice for them to try a few local things that add a little bit of culture to their stay. One excellent thing which i forgot to mention was the direct link to Kidzania - something we have done in London before and they were keen to do again! Last but by no means least was the pools - WOW - The boys practically lived in them , plenty of play areas , twists turns, different pools , the lazy river etc etc. We had an amazing time. We did head out to Singapore itself once or twice and this was sooo easy bus number 123 takes you directly to Orchard Road in around 20 minutes so sightseeing in the city but using Sentosa as a base was the perfect option for us and i beileve will be for families visiting Singapore!",2019-08-01,PreCovid,0

Rooftop pool quite small but really looks the part and has an impressive view of the bay, shipsm planes coming in. Ground floor pool is bigger, better for swimming. Both have frangipani trees and plenty of nice big towels available. That made for a good relaxing stopover.

Food in the hotel pretty average and fairly expensive - plenty of places to eat nearby but they're not air conditioned so we ate in the hotel.

The staff I asked to redo it was apologetic and cleaned it immediately, but it was not a nice welcome. Bath tub was cracked and shower curtain in a sad state. Front desk staff was not particularly warm/welcoming given that they knew it was a birthday booking and there was no welcome basket or even a small birthday card in the room.

The free shuttle bus to the airport was on time, but quite old (some seatbelts not in working order); the driver was also quite rude and uncommunicative about the return pick-up point. The roof top pool had a few loose tiles and you need to be careful not to cut yourself.

If you're not too fussy, there were some positive notes, for example, the king bed was clean and comfortable and made for good nights' sleep, and the unblocked view from my room across the sea was nice.. Club room facilities on the 6th floor were ok, and staff there much more personal and friendly than downstairs.

My name is Din and I had recently received an invite from you to stay at any of your hotels for my Birthday Day. I decided to take the opportunity and set my mind to stay at Changi Village as me and my wife had our wedding reception in 2012 to bring back the memories.¬†

In writing, I would like to share my unpleasant welcome here at Changi Village. Upon arrival 2pm, please take note in point form

- Wasnt greeted in a welcoming manner by the front desk by a male staff.

- He without eye contact, directly ask me ""yes, what do you want?""¬†

- No welcome greetings, and directly ask for my ID or Passport.¬†

- He went in without informing to hold on a while politely and make me waited 3mins not to be exaggerate.

-He finally came out and tell me my room is not paid and request for my Credit¬†Card.

- Told him that im booking under the birthday Treat as It IS MY BIRTHDAY TODAY. He look puzzled in a calm manner and keep looking at the screen.¬†

- I requested for a bigger room as I understand I was given a Free Upgrade. But to my horror, I was declined and told the hotel was over book by 6 reservations.¬†

- Feeling dissapointed, I ask him I dont mind transferring to another hotel and paying more for a bigger room as Im having guests for cutting cake.¬†

- He didnt replied me and kept telling me He is trying his best to give me a room with sea view and a balcony.¬†

- To me, the feeling is destroyed. Check in the room with Balcony and its full of uncleared cigarettes butts.¬†

- The whole check in process took about 10 to 12 mins. I wasnt even offered a complimentary birthday cake in my room. All this small gestures makes a big impact on my birthday day. Received complimentary cake from other non Far East Hospitality hotel before.¬†

I hope you could clarify and get to me regarding this. I think a strong front team staffs makes a great different to US PAYING GUESTs to stay in your hotels and make a memoriable stay for us. No point having a special request box in your online reservation portal if THEY ARE NOT GOING READ AND HONOUR IT.

The ballroom was lit up great and have such beautiful set up of the chairs and table arrangements. The hotel chef did an extraordinary take on the richness of flavors in all the food and for that I am so impress by it.

The Bridal Suite was abit of a letdown, room 327. The windows was not clean and vision of the view I had was blurred. In addition, one of the drawer in the room which has the refrigerator inside was broken. The desk phone was not in a working condition to call upon the room service, so each time I have to call '0' and get the operator to transfer my call. My worst experience would be on the last night of my stay, the lighting switched on its own and it was at about 1.20am when I am already in my dreams halfway. Despite the effort of the engineer to come and fix it, it was still spoil and really made me so frustrated since it disturbed my sleep.

Filthy window curtains, non-working seat belts, and a driver that was on his cell phone the entire hour-long drive. Yes, a full hour to get to the hotel at 10am - not even in rush hour traffic. We weren't stopped in traffic during this drive, just drove and drove and drove on.

The hotel check-in was quick and easy. We explained again to the front desk that we did not want to be disturbed during our short stay, and requested shuttle service back to the hotel 6 hours later at 5pm.

Room was ok. Bathroom door seemed about to come off its hinges, and the dirt in the corners need attending to. Bed and pillows were comfortable. Room size was fair, and there was complimentary coffe and tea and bottled water.

About an hour into our stay, maintenance knocked on our door and awakened us. They told us that we needed to move to another room, and our room needed repairs to the tub that was leaking. I made a call to the front desk to let them know that we were NOT moving - they shouldn't have put us in this room if it needed maintenance. OK. Back to sleep.

Another half-hour in to our much needed sleep, housekeeping knocked on our door even though our do not disturb button was on, wanting to know if we needed anything. YES - NOT TO BE DISTURBED AGAIN!

So - all in all, ir was a short and frustrating stay.",2019-07-01,PreCovid,0

family,,False,,"Good value hotel We stayed at Village Hotel Changi for one night as a group of 10 and we had 5 rooms.  We chose this hotel simply for the price because there is not much choice for airport hotels in Singapore and the one right at the airport was just too expensive for our group.  So, this was the one we went for.As we were looking for a quick layover between flights and just wanted a comfortable bed and free transfers we were happy but there are a few things to be aware of.  First of all, the hotel is not super close to the airport and the transfers they provide are limited to strict pick up and drop off times. We arrived quite late into Singapore and went to the transport desk to get our courtesy transfer.  We had to wait about an hour for the next bus but this went quickly.  Just be aware that there are strict pick up times for this service with no exceptions.  It is a first come first serve basis so make sure you ask the hotel for the schedule before you go so you can check the times based on your arrival.  Our arrival was delayed so we just missed one of the buses.   The bus arrived right on time and we were taken to our hotel.  It was about 15 - 20 minutes away from the airport. For your return trip to the airport it is the same and you MUST book a spot on the right bus.  We were a group of 10 so we were lucky enough to get a spot on a bus that suited our flight but be aware that the schedule back to the airport is also strict with no exceptions.   For example, on the day of our departure there was a 6.30am bus and then the next one was 8.00am.  Check the schedule to see if there is a bus that suits your return flight.  Also, there are limited spots on the return so you must book.  Allow for the time that they also take to drop people off to other terminals as they drop off at terminals 1, 2 and 3 in the one journey. When we arrived we were quickly checked into our rooms and I have to say that the rooms were not fancy as expected but they had everything we needed for our stay - very comfortable bed, good shower, free WIFI, good TV with lots of channels, some bathroom amenities, towels, water.  What more do you need for a quick overnight stay?   We had 5 rooms and all 5 rooms were the same and everyone in our group had a good nights sleep.The breakfast buffet was a nice surprise with lots of choice and everyone had a good breakfast before we departed for our flight.Honestly, I think if you are looking for the least amount of cost to stay overnight near Changi Airport - this is a good choice.   You will not get all of the bells and whistles but you will get everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Just be mindful of the bus transfers and get this information in advance.  We emailed the hotel and they sent us the schedule and they followed it to the letter with no exceptions but also no delays.  BOOK your return transfer in advance to avoid missing out and making sure you get to your terminal at the right time.  They will get you there but you must book!",2019-07-01,PreCovid,0

We have stayed in converted Barracks and this place twice. Each time I feel relaxed; so different than Orchard Road, etc. The location is near some Hawker Centres and little Bars, but is very quiet and the food from the Hawker Centres very good indeed. Even one of the local bars had a really nice burger (home made patty), chips, and salad, and  pint of Grolsch for $23; and the Hawker Centre has one of the best chicken rice sets (set A, for $5) I have had. The hotel is comfortable and the bed was firm-ish but not the standard Asian hard. I slept really well. The hotel is currently under renovation to I believe its former glory. The staff are exceptionally nice and try to be helpful. Visitors we had loved the infinity pool and the kids the ground floor one. To be completely honest the hotel is a little faded, but nevertheless extremely comfortable. We had a lovely birthday lunch with visitors and as old people (i.e. over 60) we got the lunch buffet at half price ($24). The Alaskan King Crab was excellent.   The gym is well set up and has a reasonable number of machines, with few free weights. It is generally empty. The hotel provides vouchers to rent a cycle for an hour (2 if 2 guests) and there are excellent cycle ways both east and west from the Hotel. Also you can get a voucher for Pilau Ubin, across the straight by ``bumboat'' and explore the remaining Kampong  style island close to Singapore. We were placed in a room that the aircon did not work and then moved, so they allowed us to go to the club lounge. If I went again for the $20 more this is superb value, with a great cocktail hour and lots of food, an undersold breakfast that includes eggs as you like them and coffee on demand.

couple,,False,,"A very good hotel with tired rooms We had a six night stay here and found the staff and service to be excellent. The location is also very good, just a short walk from the waterfront and an even shorter walk to the adjacent village with multiple choices for dining all at reasonable prices. The hotel operated a complimentary shuttle on a fixed timetable to the airport and inside the terminal there is a hotel shuttle desk which provides information and reserves a place for you on the next shuttle.The journey takes about 20 minutes and the MRT system is accessed from the airport and took 45 to 55 minutes with a change of train to get to the city.
There is a nice roof top swimming pool with some nice loungers and of course a very good view .
The rooms were very tired, the thermostat for the airconditioning did not work and if we needed to adjust the temperature within the room we had to call reception who sent an engineer to our room and after removing a ceiling panel, manually adjusted the temperature. We soon got tired of this arrangement as we wanted to have the temperature adjusted when we needed it, so we asked for a room change and this was marginally better. All the furniture in the two rooms we occupied had wood veneers on them and in many places these had broken away and in one or two cases the damaged area was covered by packaging tape. Not what you would expect from such a hotel.
I was going to rate the hotel at 3 stars, but then thought this was a little hard, but I think 4 stars is a little generous. Would I stay here again? Probably if I was transiting through Singapore but its location makes it a little difficult for an extended stay if you wish to visit the city area.",2019-03-01,PreCovid,0
family,4.0,True,Positive,"Great staycay with lotsa food options nearby Ive been to Katong most of my staycay so i decided to try a new area under the same organisation.
Smooth check in and was given a room i thot that would be a lil noisy since its right infront of the lift lobby. However, i was wrong. Room is well soundproofed and i din even hear anything outside not even when im in the toilet. Sadly, the aircon wasn working well even after 5 hrs of checking in and got the technician to check. Gave me fan to use for the night. They could do it the next day but it will take some time so they got me another room up which was a little smaller but w a better view. (I cud hav done w the fan if it wasn for the noise that accompanied my sleep thru the first night üòÇ)
Suspected that this room jus got painted cos they had stuffs right outside the room. When i left for the pool something spilled infront of my door, told the housekeeper (signalled) along the doorway but she just voiced it out from where she standing that they will clear it ltr. Well im not sure abt that ....
They were doing some works and i was afraid it was gonna be noisy and will disturb my husband‚Äôs sleep since he jus got back frm his night shift but same, room was well proofed too unless you‚Äôre in the toilet. (This rm was smaller)
We love the rooftop pool and its view. Thats where we spent most of our outdoor time there. The only thing was the toilet looked a lil spooky i didn dare to use it at all ü§≠
I cant fault anything of the hotel except thats its a lil worn but its all gd, really!!
There‚Äôs sooo many food options nearby and a gd area to kinda chillack cos u hav the beach in a walking distance.
Out of the 3 nights i stayed there, i called for housekeeping only once and it was rather disappointing.
My bed was done, toiletries was topped up, rubbish thrown but ..
my floor still had crumbs frm my son‚Äôs munchies before we left which means it wasn cleaned well. My coffee wasn topped up, worst was my cup wasnt even washed.
Since i saw some trolleys infront of the other rooms i walked over to see if i cud inform any housekeeper but i cant see anyone (prolly inside and i didn wanna open to see) until i hear a voice inside talking on the phone in tamil, i knocked and it took awhile for the lady to open. There, one of the housekeeper and i shared with her my concern. Her reply was, ‚Äúdid u ask my staff?‚Äù I was confused. She repeated and i asked her if i am supposed to be looking for HER STAFF. She prolly noticed i was alrdy annoyed and she went the the trolley to get some coffee n whatnots for me and i jus walked over to my room to share w her what i needed to share. Told her abt the room. She filled up the coffee n etc and left the room.
No .. i din chase i din call the operator.
I dun wanna spoil my mood for jus that but the hotel need to really do something abt the housekeeping staffs.
Reading through the reviews, thats one area too that was mentioned repeatedly. So pls dont let that part of the svc area bring the hotel down.
Id come back to this hotel any other time without a second thought cos i had a great stay irregardless.
Shoutout to the Lead tech Dev and the ones who handled my check In and check out (i forgot their names,sorry) and also Ain who handled my room shift.
Thank u!! Ill c u soon ‚ô•Ô∏è sorry for the lengthy review",2019-06-01,PreCovid,1
friends,,False,,"Good stay but hotel a bit out of the way It was a very good stay. Staff was very friendly throughout but for some reason, couldnt get into contact with the front desk even though we called using the phone provided in the room. Had to physically go down and wait for my turn to speak to the receptionist for just a few simple questions about the room.

Both pools had a bit of an issue with design, for example, the rooftop pool (meant to be like an infinity pool) had a ledge blocking you from the edge of the pool. Assumed it was for ""safety reasons"" but felt it made it more dangerous instead as people could simple climb onto the ledge and over the tall glass railing at the edge of the pool as compared to without a ledge, people would find it very hard to cross over from the pool floor. Outdoor pool wasnt very well kept as well. Glass was very dirty and so was the area around the pool that was littered by insects and leaves. Had a design for ""underwater photography"" which meant that one side of the pool was made with see through glass which, again, was a very weird design as the pool was directly in front of the main restaurant for the hotel so people, whilst eating, could easily see you swimming.

Also, good tip, rent a car or be prepared to hire a cab most of the time as the hotel is a bit out of the way. Nearest mrt is a 30+min bus ride from the hotel. Would be a good hotel for those wanting to spend most of their trip indoors and relaxing but not so much for those wanting to see the site or explore. Its an excellant place for Singaporeans wanting to escape the busy city life for a few days to relax or for those that just want to stay in and relax

All the staff under her charge on the 6th floor lounge have been observed to have excellent customer service, and the best part of it, it's genuinely carried out. You can see that they take great pride in what they do, and that to me should be recognized by the Far East Management.

Their advice was to use booking.com for Singapore hotels to avoid these sorts of problem. The room was fabulous and same price as a shoebox room we had had in the city centre. The hotel is just a few minutes walk from the coast where there was a lovely coastal walk and a nice bar at the boat club looking over the water. There were also plenty of local shops and eateries.

business,,False,,"Poor condition hotel with mold in room I stayed in Village Hotel Changi for a 5 nights stay and it's been a disappointing experience.

At check-in, the staff simply didn't greet me with any welcome message. The worst, the staff didn't even bother to greet me with a simple ""hello"", which is basically the bare minimum of courtesy when addressing an arriving customer. This has set the tone for the rest of my stay, this lack of politeness is hardly acceptable given the industry they are working in.

When I arrived at the hotel, it was nearly 21:30 and the queue at the front desk was extremely busy. At least 20 mins were necessary before I could walk to my room.

Once in the room, I've been struck by a strong smell of humidity, a loud noise coming from the A/C and mold in most of the corners of the bathroom. The paint in the bathroom is flaking, the electrical board is left visible in the closet and the lighting in the bathroom is made of white light bulbs so you can imagine the delight it is for your eyes... The room overall is clean but the atmosphere, the ambiance and the setting just don't make you want to stay in the room.

You might think the room condition is only applicable to the room, but the whole hotel is in a poor condition with obvious lack of focus in maintaining the property correctly. The paint on the walls of the corridors are flaking and you can see there is a layer a paint that has been brushed on the top as a quick fix.

The breakfast of this hotel is to be mentioned for its poor quality and poor choice...

In other words, pass your way. This hotel needs serious refurbishment and training for their staff to elevate its game to where it pretends to be.",2019-04-01,PreCovid,0
friends,,False,,"3 stars, not 4. But clean, tidy and cheap. Very far from city centre, but amazing local hawker food on doorstep. PLUS POINTS:

- Venue and furnishings in the hotel room looked dated, but it was neat and clean. The floor of the Superior Twin Room is not carpeted - it is parquet. Twin beds could also be pushed together. There is also a window seating bay, table / chair for you to work on (if needed), a relatively large (but old) LCD TV screen, and a bath tub. While there is no holder for the shower head above your head, there is a rain shower installed, which was very nice. The water heated up instantaneously too.

- Air-conditioning was bloody frigid! Which is great for people looking to escape the heat and humidity outside. It is adjustable too, although I feel like the thermostat might be broken - adjusted it to 28 degrees celsius and it still felt like 18 degrees celsius. Personally, a plus point to me because I would rather a cold hotel room than a hot one in an equatorial country, but some people may not be cool enough to appreciate the chill.

- Check-out was instantaneous - handed the hotel cards to the counter staff, they zapped it and we were on our merry way. There was no deposit collected from me, which is a surprise because I expected to put down a deposit when checking-in. I left at an odd hour and not during peak check-out time. The counter staff then was smiling and friendly.

- Amazing food on the door-step of the hotel. I cannot emphasize enough that you should try the local flavors by walking 5 minutes to Changi Village Food Centre. If you do not even want to walk so far, right outside of the hotel there is a line of eateries with a good mix of Malay, Indian, Chinese and even Western / fusion food. The food is cheap too, for 2 pax you can get over 5 dishes and drinks for the same price or less than 1 plate of hotel room service food.

- Bed was just right, neither too soft nor too firm. Same could be said of the pillows, which were very comfortable. One would not have a problem sleeping in (unless disturbed by children screaming - see negative point below). Duvets were fluffy and well-laundered (smelt nice).

- There is complimentary parking, contrary to what Booking.com states.

- Cheap! Less than S$130 (inc. tax + charges) for 1 night for a Superior Twin Room.

MINUS POINTS:

- Check-in was messy and slow. There were 4 counters, but only 3 being manned. There was no sign indicating that people were to form 1 line only - one of the counter staff kept telling people to go to the single queue. This resulting in people jumping queue and the counter staff did not know they had jumped queue and served them, thus resulting in even longer waiting time. I arrived around 2:30PM and the waiting time to check-in was almost 15 minutes. For efficacy purposes, there should be clearly demarcated lines / signs telling individuals which line is for check-in, which line is for check-out and or other enquiries. Additionally, at popular / high peak check-in timings, all counters should be fully manned. Check-in staff also seemed rather stressed and did not have welcoming smiles and were rather curt. Can't be blamed, I supposed they want to get people into the hotel ASAP.

- This place is VERY far from the city centre. From Lavender MRT by Grab / Taxi, it took almost half an hour and cost close to $20. If you are looking to explore the city centre, then this is not ideal for you.

- Very family-centric hotel. Many children constantly running up and down the corridors shouting and screaming, and this could be heard in the rooms. This hotel also seems popular with tour groups from Malaysia / Indonesia which adds to the noise. If you are looking for a ""peaceful"" beach resort getaway, this is definitely not for you.

- Although the rooms are advertised as ""sound-proofed"", I think the hotel needs to work on that. In addition to the children running and screaming in the corridors, I could also hear people in the room next door talking.

- Some of the channels on the TV suffered from poor quality sound. Might not be the fault of the TV because other channels' sound quality seemed quite alright. The TV is an LCD but not a SmartTV.

- There was only one bottle of body soap and one bottle of ""conditioning shampoo"". Perhaps I'm too used to being provided a bottle each of body soap, shampoo and conditioner? Toothbrush / toothpaste tasted a little funky.

TLDR: I would give this 3.5/5 stars on TripAdvisor, but we can only give full stars, so I've rounded this down to 3. It is advertised as a 4 star hotel, but it feels more like a 3 star. It is extremely far from city centre (half an hour by taxi alone, if you take public transport like MRT / Bus you'd be taking an hour and a half) but no doubt, relatively close to Changi Airport. However, there is truly amazing local hawker fare on your doorstep. While the facilities are dated, it was neat, tidy and clean. This is not suitable for couples or those looking for a romantic / peaceful beach getaway, as there are many tour groups / families with children who use this resort.",2019-04-01,PreCovid,0

As we got out of the lift on the 5th floor there was an overpowering smell of solvent paint - this smell permeated throughout the corridors.  When we arrived at our room - there was again a smell of paint and also a strong smell of damp.  We contacted reception and were given another room - again on the 5th floor.  This room was supposed to be a Deluxe but in our opinion had nothing deluxe about either of the rooms we were offered.  We were only here for one night as we were flying back home the next day - but we really did need a good nights sleep before a 13 hour flight.  The shower was over the bath - however there was a brown stain that looked as if someone had been to the toilet in the bath.  On closer inspection it seemed that the base of the bath was damaged and a coloured liner was showing where a piece of the bath surface was missing.  As we were exceptionally tired having been travelling all day we decided to stay in the room but knew that we would not be able to use the shower the next morning for fear of it leaking.

We arrived too early for check-in. But this was no problem at all, as we could leave our luggage at the reception and spent the time at the rooftop pool (towels provided). The hotel is close to the water and a number of beautiful walks start right at the doorstep. Check out Changi Point Coastal Walk and Changi Beach Park or take one of the small boats to Pulau Ubin. A short walk down the road takes you to Hawkers food court where you can find lots of stalls with a good selection of Asian foods at incredibly friendly prices. This is where a lot of the locals come to eat lunch - you won't see many tourists there.
We were blown away by the view from our rooms on the 7th floor and could hardly get the kids away from the infinity rooftop pool.

2.Great Location
-5 to 10mins. walk to Changi Village Hawker Center (try the Chicken Cutlet Ipoh Hor Fun!!)

-good food close by (a couple of cafes, and a multitude of restaurants with all sorts of cuisine nearby)

Long Version:
Wow! This turned out to be a great family staycation!

We stayed at Village Hotel Changi during the CNY week (Feb 2-5). We booked a Club Room for me, my wife, and our son.

Check-in was smooth, with the friendly ‚ÄúMag"" assisting us. We reached the hotel at around 11.45, and she got us checked in early. She got us a room on level 6, with a decent view. Sasi was also nice and loaned us an umbrella when we left for Changi Village that afternoon.

Club Lounge access, a benefit of Club Room booking, was great! Free drinks the whole day, a more peaceful breakfast, and a lobby overlooking the water. You could also see planes coming in and leaving Changi Airport which is very close by. There is a friendly staff there named Via too.

Buffet Breakfast spread had all the essentials. The staff at the Saltwater Cafe are awesome. Maria and Krishna are always helpful. We were always greeted with smiles, and they were always ready with toddler high chair, and cutlery without us having to request!

The Infinity Pool at level 8 is nice. It had a jacuzzi, and also a wading pool for children! The pool outside Saltwater Cafe is also nice. It looks like a giant aquarium. I like that there is a lounging area there as well, and some space to walk about, especially if you have a child.

Housekeeping staff at the 6th level are also very friendly and willing to assist (I should have asked for the nice Chinese guy‚Äôs name).

This is one of those hotels that after checking out, the first thing I do when I reach home is look at the calendar for the next time we will be available to come back!

Such poor customer service for a 4 star in the hospitality industry! Guess I am no more a guest after check out... and I won't be back.

The staff is generally unfriendly, unhelpful and uptight. The concierge staff also just goes through the motion in helping with luggages when hotel shuttle arrives.

The hotel is located in Changi but it takes about 25-30 minutes from/to the Changi airport with the hotel shuttle. Not convenient for commute by public transport and it is a distance to CBD. There are lots of local eateries and restaurants around the hotels which is a plus.

The room is reasonably spacious. Rain shower over bathtub in bathroom though facilities are dated. The level 8 has a good view with the infinity pool and pretty windy at night. Free hotel shuttle both ways from/to Changi Airport at 1.5 hours interval.

Note, my parents moved to Village Hotel Katong. They were able to use the club lounge (and gym to shower) after checkout to wait for the last hotel shuttle at 9:30pm for their late night flight. The front desk staff even informed the club lounge staff to take care of my parents and they were invited to the evening cocktails and canapes - this is without request as they planned to go out for dinner.

family,,False,,"A Disappointing Staycation 1. I stayed over Chinese New Year, which was a huge mistake.  The hotel simply is not capable of dealing with a full house.  This was most apparent at the rooftop swimming pool, which was incredibly crowded, had very little space for people to lay their things down (not to mention lounge chairs to relax on between swims), and never had enough towels available , meaning it was often necessary to just air-dry oneself (and run the risk of catching cold) and then drip water into the lifts and hallways.2.  The check-in experience was astonishingly inefficient.  It seemed to take *15 minutes* to check in *every* group, with the check-in agent making numerous trips back and forth to the back office for some inexplicable reason.  In our case, the check-in agent said it was taking so long because he was trying to find us ""the best room possible"".  However, see #4 below.3. I booked a Club Room with 2 double beds on the hotel website, which said there was one such room still available for booking.  The room I was given was a room with 1 king bed, meaning we had to put a rollaway bed into the  room to get a second bed, which of course made the room very crowded.  So the room I booked that the website said was available was given to somebody else.  If nothing else, this means that the hotel has the flexibility to re-allocate rooms to people, but then see #4 below.  In addition, the check-in agent said nothing to me about what the Club privileges included, what the hours were for breakfast and the evening snacks, etc.  In any case, the Club itself wasn't anything special, despite it costing an extra S$50 or so per night.4. The vast majority of rooms at this property are outward facing rooms with a view, and I asked for such a room in my booking.  I was given an inward facing courtyard room.  I was told that all other rooms were ""occupied"" (not reserved or allocated, but ""occupied""), implying it was not possible to move me to a different room, and which would mean that I was the last person to check in for the day.  This was clearly a lie, as there were still long check-in queues for the next several hours (see #2).5.

They have happy hour where alcoholic drinks are provided and any time you can access the lounge with your key for coffee/tea/drinks. Also enjoyed the rooftop pool with some great views over the water. Beds are so comfy and rooms are very spacious. The breakfast buffet is extensive. We also had included the hop on hop off bus and were given discounts by the hotel. Also got free passes for the ten bowling alley across the road.

They run a shuttle from the airport to the hotel complementary both ways, but times are not close. We made the mistake of taking a taxi which cost $38 , instead of Grab which would have been $12!
We definitely caught the free shuttle back as was at the airport in roughly 20 mins.

Check in very slow, as they only have 2 staff working the counter.
Like most 3-4 star hotels once you clear the lobby and exit the lift to your floor you notice how tired a place is. But you don‚Äôt sleep there, the rooms are very well appointed and the bed just wonderful.
Wi- fi reception throughout the hotel is excellent. The breakfast next morning is very extensive and nothing is any trouble for the staff.

The hotel has a weird D shape that may be confusing for some to find their room. Our room was very basic, overlooking the central courtyard on the same level of the central garden, which can be a problem with privacy since people could be walking right outside your window when visiting the garden, plus a bit dark since the building is 8+ storeys and we were at the bottom.

I‚Äôm sure there are better rooms and we just got a last allocation room since we arrived almost at midnight and were staying for only one night.

One staff member even watched us rummaging in the cupboards trying to find plates and didn't even ask if we wanted anything or even tell us to stop!  One lady member of staff, when she was in the lounge, kept it well stocked and maintained but otherwise the club lounge experience was pretty poor.  The roof pool was nice but the jacuzzi area was treated like a kids' paddling pool by other guests and was therefore off-limits most of the time.  There is a downstairs pool as well that is in full view of the restaurant, which I found a bit odd, and the first room we had was really dirty in the bathroom (the toilet was....stained...).  We also paid extra (nearly 50 SGD per PERSON) for a BBQ meal which you'd think would be tasty but everything was overcooked and oversalted, and the person taking the orders wasn't listening or even looking at you so our orders were wrong AND horrible!

Arrived early in Singapore (8 am) and check in was empty. I was booked in very quickly with the normal courteous efficiency I have come to expect from the hotel staff, who also welcomed me back as a frequent visitor.

My room was clean and for me at least, comfortable and cool thanks to the A/C. The bed and pillows are fantastic. I slept very well each and every night.

The club lounge and the staff were as welcome as ever. The coffee machine was a godsend after such a long flight. The food they provide is good, though the evening nibbles were a bit repetitive after 2 or 3 days. Special mention must go to young Al, who was chatty and interested in what you had been up to during the day. He made sure he welcomed each guest and made sure you were well looked after whilst under his care.

Again, special mention to Ding, the housekeeper on level 6. Welcomed like an old friend, always smiling and chatty. Unfortunately, Ding informed me that she is moving to the new Village hotel on Sentosa. This is sad as she is genuinely a very nice person and I'm sure I will miss her. But I wish her all the best at her new venture.

I love Changi Village as a whole package. The hawker centre just over the road offers everything you could ever want to try. The coastal walk is pleasant (though a big section was closed for renovation - scheduled to finish at the end of 2018). The park is a nice place to wonder, look and relax.

Having said that, the hot local foods (noodles, porridge, and also an omelette stand) was very decent. There's plenty to do nearby - explore the famous Changi Village hawker center, we found a wonderful mamak place (Mr Mamak) selling wonderful dum briyani, take a walk at the changi boardwalk or changi spit/ beach. There are also nice and more upscale eating places nearby - Coastal settlement, some seafood grills and bars along the beach, and a variety of restaurants in the hotel itself. I think you can also rent bicycles from the rental shops along the beach or even from the hotel. If you want to venture a bit further, take the bumboat from the changi jetty to pulau ubin (Ubin island).

family,,False,,"standard of housekeeping has to improve, rooms starting to look it's age I booked two superior rooms for a one night stay with my family. What struck me first was the lack of cleanliness of one of the rooms. The table had coffee stains left by the previous guests. There were small bits of food crumbs on the floor and there were ants. The toilet sink was choked and the sink could certainly use some cleaning as there were stains left behind. These issues did not affect the functionality of the room but it did not leave a good first impression.The other thing about the rooms is the issue of wear and tear- the sliding doors of the wardrobe was spoilt and the doors were chipped. The furnishings of the room are starting to look it's age and could certainly do with some refurbishing.

The restaurant Salt Water is excellent which I would highly recommend. The break buffet is very nice. It also have a buffet dinner which is very generous in terms of spread of good on offer. The restaurant staff is very friendly and attentive. I would go back and dine here if time would allow in the future.

The only thing one must realize is that the hotel is far from your usual central destinations so taxi is the mist efficient means of transport which could be pricey. Grab taxi station is available at the lobby, but otherwise you can wait if front by the taxi stand and you won‚Äôt wait long.

They have free hotel/airport shuttle, so be sure to arrange for one before hand.

Check in and check out is very efficient.

We were very very pleased with Banquet Manager, Sanjeewa as well as the banquet staff (lady) who assisted with the tea ceremony. Both of them were very very experienced and provided cues for us which made it fuss-free and smooth process for us.

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Club Lounge all the way! This hotel shows a bit of its age. They keep it clean, but there's a hint of dinginess in the corners. That's the only negative I have and it's a minor quibble at best!
The staff is friendly, courteous and very helpful. When I arrived earlier than check in, they gave me a pass for the club lounge so I could hang out and snack while I waited and caught up to local time.
Club level is the way to go here, having breakfast, and all day access to snacks and refreshments is a big plus to the experience. Evening cocktails are basic, but generous.
The infinity pool on the roof is a great way to greet the dawn, although they could stand to clean the water scale off the glass more often. ;)

However she said we can only use when we need it and must return immediately after use.  So when we bring my mum to my room (which is far away from lift), i immediately return the wheelchair.  However, on the second day around 4pm, when we request for wheelchair,  staff said one of the hotel guest was using it  Around 7pm, i ask for it again and staff said the guest is still in possess.  I ask her which guest is holding the wheelchair but she said she has no idea as there is no record.  She ask the porter to look around but still cannot find.  It seemed that the hotel guest had been keeping the wheelchair for his/her own use for whole day.  The porter said the guest likely keep the wheelchair in his/her room.  My poor mum need to walk with difficulty for most of the time without the wheelchair.  We had been considerate that we return the wheelchair immediately however other hotel guest was not considerate.  The hotel should keep a record of the room number of the guest who check out the wheelchair and should limit the time use.    When i commented that the hotel guest should return immediately once used and not keep in room, the manager Rommel said that as the hotel guest need it, so he/she can use it even for the whole day.  In that case, then i should keep it when i first check in the hotel on the first day!It is a miserable experience stay indeed!The only person who help my mum up to my room was the kind-hearted porter Mr Judin who ask my mum to sit on a chair  and assist to push the chair to our room.",2018-12-01,PreCovid,1

family,,False,,"Worst ever Far East experience I am speechless. The service here in Village Hotel Changi is atrocious. They are so bad that the staffs from the nearby hawkers seems to be able to do a better job in terms of service. We have stayed in various hotels in Singapore and Johor, from the budget hotels to the high end hotels. And we know what to expect from the various categories as well as the hotels. This is the first Far East Organization Hotel that really dissapoint.

On 9th of December, my partner and i planned to go across to johor to take a break but at 6am, the traffic was horrendous and thus we decided to just stay here in Singapore. It was a Sunday morning, and thus its hard to get an early check-in, which we understand. So we gave a few facilities a call first before heading down because it would save us the hustle.

It was 8 in the morning, when Mr Ashraff answered our call. He was very nice to converse with and was very welcoming. He even told us that there were rooms even if we came there at that timing. And after asking, if there was any promotions or upgrades, he said he might be able to upgrade us to a deluxe if we booked a superior or even purchase the breakfast at promotional fee. All i emphasized was, i was from the west end of singapore, and i didnt want to have to make a journey to the east end of Singapore and ended up dissapointed in terms of having to wait. We decided to give it a try as this hotel is where we might be staying for our wedding, due to the pakage offered by signature wedding. For a pakage price of 35 thousand, we decided we should see how the hotel was.
The wedding wont be at the hotel, but it would be across the hotel and since Village Hotel Changi is the nearest hotel, i think it might just be the reason why it is included in the wedding pakage. It is a 3days 2night stay. From the first point of contact with the hotel, it seemed that it is going to be worth the stay. We even planned about purchasing the upgrade to suite room since our wedding pakage includes it.

At about 9.30am, we reached the facility. We were really looking forward for the stay only to be received by a staff by the name of Gio. There were no smiles, instead, we were given the kind of unwelcoming look. I carried on to greet him first and said that we have a booking from booking.com.
His reply, all our check-in timing is supposed to be at 2pm. And i told him to check with his colleague Ashraff, because i conversed with him earlier on the phone.
After checking with Ashraff, his next reply was that, he could only provide a superior room with a nasty attitude voice. We checked with him to check with mr ashraff as Ashraff had PROMISED us differently.
After about 5mins of checking, GIO told me, THE BEST he could do, is to give me a Deluxe TWIN room. I started to get turn off by his attitude as he is wasting my journey and trip and i asked to speak to Ashraff instead, but after a few more minutes, Gio gave me a deluxe king. I dont wish to argue with him there, but he really fail on every aspect of customer service. I didnt want to judge him by his appearance, but his attitude is off along with his appearance. Messy goatee and visible tattoo on his hand while wearing the Far East uniform, really makes me wonder, how did the hotel and Far East did their recruitment. If he had extraordinary customer service skills, it would have been different.

In the room, 521, we called and spoke to the duty manager, Karen, about our displeasure with the check-in experience. She was attentive and she did listened on us. We told her that we would like to purchase the upgrades because during our check-in with Gio, it was incomplete. He didnt even advise us on the wifi password for us to even ask about the upgrades.
She promised to give us the upgrades, on the hotel, as a recovery of service, but we would have to wait till 4 or 5 in the afternoon. We thought that its ok then and we took a nap as its still only 9 plus in the morning.

In the afternoon, Karen came with the new room keys but i wasnt ready as i just woke up. We agreed for half an hour later. When we were ready, atleast Karen had the initiative to inform us that she had to attend to something urgent and would ask a colleague to bring us to our new room. That colleague that came, was a grumpy man who just hand me the keys and threw a nasty face and went off. So my partner and i just grab our stuffs and walked over to the lift. To my surprise, the man that handed our keys, was chatting amd laughing with the housekeeping lady by the corridor.

Our new room, 402. There was ciggarette smell, and it wasnt the suite that we wanted to upgrade to, as per description on the hotel's website as well as the pakage on signature wedding. At that point, i was already too let down and too dissapointed with the hotel, to the extend that i wish to just check out and check in to another facility. When i gave a call to speak to karen, it was another duty manager, by the name of rommel. Again, like karen, he is attentive and polite. He arranged for another room, but it would take some waiting again. Since im going out, i just told him to pass the keys and when i come back, ill just head to the room. I was too dissapointed with the hotel staffs that i didnt wish to see any of them anymore.

When i returned at about 1045pm, i was surprised by the room given. This time, it was finally on par with what we would have wanted. We told ourselves that, maybe, just maybe, we may have judged the hotel wrongly. As it was our anniversarry, we brought back a cake from an event that we went from. But the cake event didnt provide us with the utensils. We called the hotel staff to request for utensils. Luckily enough, the lady who took our call and the man who delivered to us, was polite and welcoming. I felt that maybe it was just the minorities in the day that needed to be sorted out.

At midnight, our room blacked out. I was in the shower, and almost slipped. The engineering who attended to us, politely told us that the room switch is faulty and we had to sleep through the night, with the lights on or in total darkness. So i had to go through the pain of sleeping with the lights on. As if we chose total darkness, it would be dangerous if we had to go to the bathroom halfway through the night.

When we woke up, at about noon, we decided to order room service. We ordered, char kway teow and nasi goreng and told to have it spicy. The nasi goreng was nice, but the char kway teow was tasteless. However, the guy who sent our order, didnt even brought a smile with him, and forgot to say thank you on his way out. I really lost all hope on the hotel service staffs. I guess they were all trained that way. We asked for the bottled water, but it never came even when we checked out later in the evening.

But overall, the service staff at the hotel really have to pull their socks together or they are just going about destroying the hotel as well as the organization's reputation. We even told Romell that i wanted to speak to the front office manager, but there was no calls or even a follow up by him or her. I guess the root of all problems, in the end, lies with the management. If they had a head of department who dont seem to care, the service staffs would be the same. Only a few individuals who seem to do the jobs that they signed up for. Now i would have to approach signature wedding and change the pakage. 35 thousand dollars for a wedding and i dont wish for it to be ruined by Village Hotel Changi.

I hope that the hotel and Far east do read on my review as it is very worrying that such low level of service standard is accepted. I do feel that if i had different skin color or a different passport, i would have been treated differently. Its quite sad that as a local, im treated as an outcast. Infact, locals or foreigner, as a service provider, the hotel should have delivered the service promised, regardless of the guest's ethnic group or country.",2018-12-01,PreCovid,0

The room was always clean and the staff was always friendly. We ate at the Saltwater restaurant there and had a huge breakfast of S$22. The only difficulty I had there was when I ordered a bowl of cereal for breakfast from two servers. Nothing came, so I left after 15 minutes.

There was construction on the interior while we stayed but it did not affect us at all. There is also a bar/restaurant inside the hotel which we used, Harry's, but it is not affiliated with the hotel.

- 10-15mins walk to Coastal Settlement.

- Accessible via bus.
- Helpful staffs when the WiFi router hang(Details in the cons)

Cons:-
- No explanation was given at the counter when special requests were not met. It would have been polite to inform that the hotel is fully booked or whatsoever and thus requests such as high floor cannot be met.
- Room given had sewer flies in the toilet basin. Despite the disappointment of given a low floor room at level 3, we were met with disgust in the toilet. A room change was made(although again the same floor) but no gesture for the extra mile was given for the bad first impression
- The shortcut key on the phone to dial for service does not work. Had to dial the number manually. Instruction given on the phone is not intuitive as dialing the last 4 digits was the only way but yet the full number was shown. Someone who doesnt know of such internal switchboard would have difficulty calling for help.
- Poor housekeeping. Cobwebs in the lift. Only one hand/face towel despite a room for two. No bathrobes. Weak battery in TV remote control.
- Slow and Poor wifi. Frequent drops in connection speed so much so that our devices couldn't maintain a stable connection with the wifi and switched back and forth to our cellular network.

But sadly, this time round I'm wrong. The stay was marred by a few stuffs and the worst is an automated wake up call set by previous occupant was not reset when the previous occupant checked out! Fancy being jolted awake by the automated wake up call at 5.45am in morning when you least expected and had a late night before!!! Seriously crap!!! Both my son, who was sleeping in the same room and me, just could fall back to sleep after that darn wake up call. Maybe the guests ygese days must remind the front desk to reset the system upon checking in. And since this previous occupant of room 545 woke up at such an early timing , apparently the room must have been checked out early too. I booked for 2 rooms, this is the first time at 3pm both rooms are not ready and only one was ready which was the 545. Other hotels I've been to usually will try to give us 1 room first n it is usually before the official check in time especially if I'm an old regular guest there. I'm just not happy with the fact when we reached the hotel at about 11am, we were told no rooms available. Left my number with recep and i took my kids together with hubby and helper, we went for our brunch. After brunch, we went back to hotel at abt 12pm. We saw a huge group of people disembarking from a mini bus and i sat a far end to observe. Somehow this group of people can get their rooms first! I saw with my own eyes, this whole group of people went up the lift to their respective rooms! Ok, i kept quiet, try my best to be an understanding guest. I didn't go up to the recep to kick up a fuss, i kept my cool and waited. I took my kids to the nearby beach to play while hoping for a call from the hotel to inform me of my rooms are ready. All the way till 2.45pm, still no call. Previous few times we were early at this hotel, the front desk did call me to inform of a room been ready. The front desk had been proactive on it, but this time, i am VERY disappointed. Service standards have dropped. Not sure if it's because of a change in management. I feedbacked the darned wake up call that was not even requested by me to the front desk, all i got was "" oh, I'm sorry abt it."" Hello!?? It is not you who got it of course, easy to say ' sorry'. There was no further attempts made by the front desk to rectified the situation. Just a simple sorry. It is a GRAVE mistake on the hotel part. Even if the guest didn't want any recourse or whatsoever, least the front desk should be trained to at least make an attempt to smoothe out the situation.

The service standard is just terrible! I'm not sure if i would want to return to here for another staycation. Nearby there's a few other hotels, n one of the other hotel did a very awesome deed even though we were not guests in the hotel. I am going to leave a review for that hotel after this review.

The club facilities were ok, however certainly the service at happy hour made up for this. The room was quite dated as was the bathroom however it was clean. The rooftop pool also seemed to lack maintenance with a large amount of debris floating in the water.

couple,,False,,"Pleasant We decided to stay overnight in Singapore en route to London and the hotel was booked by our travel agent. When we arrived at the hotel the staff were wonderful and friendly. The room was a decent size and had a small patio looking out over the village. We decided to pay for the buffet breakfast in which there was heaps to choose from. If you are staying longer than 1 night there is a beautiful infinity pool on the rooftop. After breakfast we went for a walk and found a boardwalk along the beach which was very pleasant. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to and from the hotel, but as we arrived at the airport after the last service we caught a taxi to the hotel which isn‚Äôt expensive, make sure you let the staff know when you check in if you need the shuttle bus as it is first in to get a seat.

solo,,False,,"Surprisingly INCONVENIENT for airport I stayed here because I had a 9am flight. It was a mistake. They provide one shuttle every 90 minutes, and the trip takes fifty (50) minutes! Yet a cab gets you to their airport in 15 minutes for 20 Singaporean dollars. The first shuttle is at 6.30am , which would have gotten me to the airport only 90 minutes before my international flight.Moreover, they only have ONE international electricity socket in the room ... which happened to NOT work for US plugs: hence my phone did not charge at all during the night, and I hopped on a 16 hour flight with less than 30% charge.Finally, there isn't anything of interest to see around Chang'i, so you'll quickly be bored.I recommend staying in downtown Singapore on the Blue subway line: from Bencoleen (spelling?) station, it's about 35 minutes til the end of the line, and just another 10 minutes by train to the airport for less than three Singaporean dollars.",2018-09-01,PreCovid,0

The reason I booked this hotel was for the shuttle from Changi Airport. A word of caution, the shuttle only runs every hour and a half. So if you miss it by three minutes like I did, you're stuck waiting or taking a $20 cab ride. My club room was very nice. The bed was AMAZING. I got great sleep... until about 5am. My neighbor was awake, slamming doors, yelling, and watching TV. I assumed they were catching an early flight and would leave soon. They did not. They were noisy for several hours. The hotel did not seem remotely close to being full, so I'm not sure why I was put in a room that was adjacent to anyone.

couple,,False,,"Second to None! Arriving at terminal 3 we‚Äôd just missed the free hotel shuttle which runs every 90 mins. No problem we got straight in a taxi & were at the hotel in no time at all, this only cost around $13. We stayed here for 5 wonderful nights in room 722, from August 27-1 September. Although it was an enclosed balcony, we had a sea view to die for, with floor to ceiling windows which ran almost the length of the room! It got better, as during the night my Fairy God Mother slipped a note under the door saying I‚Äôd been upgraded to the exec lounge, really!!!! It was our anniversary so this was a real treat, not that I‚Äôd mentioned it. This meant we had free breakfast, nibbles & soft drinks throughout the day, food & alcohol in the evenings, 2 pieces of laundry done per day, HO HO bus tickets, & 2 hours access to the airport lounge. I thought I‚Äôd died & gone to heaven! It‚Äôs definitely worth paying for if you want to really spoil yourself. This hotel‚Äôs in a prime location by the beach & has so much to offer.  Yet if you fancy the city for a day they run a free shuttle that leaves at 10.30 daily, this drops off at Bugis Village by the MTR, & Far East Plaza, Orchard Road.  There‚Äôs bus stops just outside the hotel if you want to leave a bit earlier, & a Bus  Station by Hawkers.  There‚Äôs usually at least one taxi outside the hotel too, they‚Äôre cheap & will get you to your destination in half the time.   Hawkers is just a few minutes away where you can buy breakfast at the bakery, fruit from the market, or a few naught beers.  Go left at the beach for the coastal boardwalk.  Or take advantage of the free hourly cycle ride that the hotel offers.  I could go on but everyone needs a few surprises, just explore. All in all we had a fantastic time at Village Hotel Changi, I just regret not staying longer.

It has views of the beach and water and is close to local food outlets. We booked a club room as we thought this would be a good choice as it offered  an executive lounge in the package with cocktails coffee snacks breakfast etc.  The club room was comfortable and the bed good.  However the room needs a good freshen up particularly the bathroom. The amenities are modern but a shower curtain is not an hygenic option in a quality hotel  There were stains around the basin and bath outlet and some mould.Some bleach would improve this. The club lounge offered a good alcohol choice but the snacks were mainly deep fried and not particularly appetising.The outside tabkes had not been wiped and  were sticky. The staff although present did not seem to notice tables needed clearing and wiping in between guests.Breakfast food was okay with excellent coffee but the fruit had run out and staff were slow to replenish.

The few years back we stayed here, they were serving complimentary banana fried fritters at the lobby area infront of the lifts. It was a nice touch, great impression and they tasted really good. Now you have to be contented with a 1/4 jar of nuts. Thats a start of how Changi Village hotel have changed.

Highlights:

1) Check-IN: The early check in promo at 10 am doest really work. We were there at 12 pm but still have to wait for our junior suite room. Told we'll have to wait till 4-5pm to check in to the particular room. While waiting we are given a twin bed room. At least there a room to rest and put our luggage and bags. But still a hassle to transfer our bags later on and change rooms.

2) Room: One of the tiles, the junior suite bathroom is ""repaired"" using a masking tape. Water pressure is low for the shower at the bathtub. Shower tubing needs to be repaired.

3) Shortage of towels was the reply when asked for an extra towels.

4) Breakfast: Flies at the pastry corner. Glass with lipstick stains. Took a long time to replenish the juices.

5) Low water pressure at the shower area at the rooftop pool.

6) Staffs: A good point to take note is that the bellman is very helpful to answer our room queries after seeing that both front office officers are busy with guests. The housekeeping staffs are welcoming with a ""hi"" and ""hello"" while we are proceeding with our rooms.

solo,,False,,"Excellent for people who want to walk or ride a bicycle alongside the beach Although the room was clean, there was already some mould forming around the silicone in the bathroom. Hence, the place could have had a small makeover. What annoyed me very much was the air-conditioning; there was no way to make my room warmer; the airco only cooled the room, which was too cold for me, especially during the night. Hence, I had to completely turn off the airco! I had originally booked the hotel to be close to the sea with a beautiful view, which by the way I didn't have, but in the end realised that all the attractions of Singapore are located in the South. Meaning each time I had to take a cab for 30 minutes to do some sight-seeing! By the way, this is not the fault of the hotel but my own as I didn't plan my trip accurately enough. But I do mention it, because if there are people who are interested in doing sight-seeing as I was, I don't suggest this hotel due to its distance from the attractions of Singapore. You are better off to take an hotel centrally located and close to an MRT. Even if the hotel is more expensive, you won't have to pay extra each time for the cab or use the Grab applications on your smartphone to reserve a ride (similar to Uber in Europe). The price for a cab is around 35 SG$ and with Grab around 24 SG$ which is not expensive after the conversion to your currency and if you compare it to the prices in Europe. However, you pay this twice daily, so in the end you are better of taking a more expensive hotel in the centre of Singapore where you can have a tourist ticket to use during your stay on the MRT (1 single trip on the MRT costs 1.70 SG$). I need to mention also that people who only want to have a walk alongside the beach, or ride the bicycle will be very happy at this hotel as the beach is in walking distance.

family,5.0,True,Positive,"Planning A Wedding? Choose Village Hotel Changi. Outstanding Wedding Experience. Top Notch Banquet Team. Dear Exceptional Staffs from Village Hotel Changi,

Words cannot fathom how delighted me and my wife were on our wedding day.
On 25 August 2018, We had the privilege of holding our wedding reception over at the Village Hotel Changi, Square Ballroom.

Throughout the reception, we received many praises from our guest.

Firstly I would like to thank Ms. Fifa, our wedding organizer, who had assisted us in conveying our vision to the respective departments. Fifa is very professional and efficient.

Next is the Buffet spread. It was sumptuous. Honorary mention to the Salted Egg Squid dish which was thoroughly enjoyed by my guest. We even had to request for a top-up! Personally, I would suggest that the Kitchen make this dish into a permanent Item on the menu. Much thanks to Chef Samsudin who had specially catered to our request of having it for our wedding even though it was not on their menu! Overall the food was fantastic.

Next is the ambiance of the ballroom. It was grand yet very cozy. The decoration was beautiful. Many had commented on how the decoration was soothing to the eyes.
Also despite having set 21 tables guest were seen moving effortlessly around the Ballroom. The comfort of air conditioning and romantic lighting help amplified the good vibes of the day. Compared to your traditional Malay wedding, our guest was really pampered and happy with the venue,

I would like to praise the Banquet Team led by the three Musketeers Sanjeewa, Raj, and Levin which was personally identified by me and my wife,
both my parents as well as my In-Laws. These three gentlemen had ensured that my desired set up and venue decoration was on point.
When I came down to the Ballroom at 02.00 am in the morning for some last minute changes in the seating arrangement, they were more than willing to assist me.
Their dedication to ensuring that their customers are satisfied is unrivaled. I would like to highlight that prompt service was delivered to my guest during the wedding and replenishment of food were flawless.

To sum it up the two things that we really value most for our wedding are that the guest is well fed and that the utmost service is being offered to them.
I firmly believe all the mentioned individuals above had significantly contributed to the success of this wedding. We cannot repeat how appreciative we are of this team.
May the Village Hotel Changi team be constantly led by these individuals and may the organisation prosper always! Keep it up, Team!

Much Love,
Mr. Abdul Hakim and Ms. Siti Maz Adlini

The shuttle only runs every 90 minutes which worked for us in one direction but not the other (taxi cost $15). We were fortunate to get a room with a view of the water which was great.

In this sense, Village Hotel Changi meets all requirement: the rooms are clean, the food are nice, the venues are adequate (aircon has slight issue, though).  But what made me to write this review is the people that runs the hotel.  Having done quite a number of these events around Asia Pacific, you normally deal with the Sales office at the beginning, and the Operations team during the event.  Countless of times that some Sales team will over promised which made it hard for the Operations team to deliver.  There is no such issue with Village Hotel Changi.  From Victoria and Fereen (Sales) to Sanjeewa, Jeff, Lavin, Raj (Operations), they are all very hands-on in supporting the event and literally provide everything they can to ensure our event is a success.

There was also a stale cigarette smoke lingering in the toilet and the shower curtains. I had to get an air freshener to be placed in the toilet. The restaurant for breakfast is halal, so Muslim guests do not need to worry about breakfast and meals. There are a lot of eating places anyway next to the hotel. The swimming pools are great.

Eric Tan (Manager) was my first point of contact who made sure I stay 17 days comfortably. Well done.

Maria from Laundry Division made sure that no stone was left unturned in Laundry and House keeping. I wish there are more Maria like service. Maria you deserve a promotion. Thanks.

Checked in at 1:45pm on March 25, 2023 and the process was as per protocol.

The ‚Äúwow‚Äôs‚Äù of Village Hotel Changi:
‚Äî1) Clean and airy lobby with a self-serve kiosk of peanuts, ice lemon water and individually wrapped layer cake that added nicely to a welcoming ambiance.

‚Äî2) Spacious and very well-equipped gym on the 5th floor. Full set of machines (treadmills, rowing machines, bikes) along with free weights and a dedicated, but small floor exercise room.

‚Äî3) Breakfast staff worked diligently with a focus on customer service. Made-to-order eggs station was a nice personal touch.

The ‚Äúoh my God, what is this?!?!‚Äù of Village Hotel Changi:
‚Äî1) Exterior facade of the inner hotel walls is peppered with unsightly and un-mistakable mold and mold-like stains.

‚Äî2) Room #519 deficiencies
a) bed platform sides/surfaces cracked and peeling;
b) entrance floor-to-ceiling mirror had black stains or marks that appear circular in shape and one akin to a slithering snake;
c) closet wall‚Äôs laminated faux wood had peeled off spots in half-a-dozen places.

If these are what our naked eyes could readily spot, what other discrepancies lie hidden within the hotel rooms and walls?

Village Hotel Changi markets and aligns itself with the Far East Hospitality group. The Outpost Hotel and the Oasia, other Far East Hospitality properties we have been guests at, have set our expectation levels. The Village Hotel Changi falls short.

,,False,,Nice hotel far away from city area. Decided to book this hotel as i want to get away from the city. Hotel is surrounded with eateries and a food centre. 10 mins walk and you will find yourself at the Changi Beach. I was greeted by friendly hotel staff and checking in was quick and smooth. Room allocated (425) was facing the road with little view of Pulau Ubin. Room was neat and tidy. The only negative part of my room was the presence of tidy ants on the desk as well as in the bathroom. This is something i hope the hotel can look into. Did not opt for breakfast as food hunting was never an issue when i stay at Village Hotel Changi. Roof top swimming pool is nice with an overview of Pulau Ubin & Pulau Tekong.

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Good hotel near airport and beach, in a laid back neighborhood For locals, this hotel is great for staycays because it is in Changi, and if anything, Singaporeans all know Changi for its totally laid back feels of a ""cheap beach side town"" that consists of probably less than 20 blocks, a small bus terminal, a famous hawker center that's great for cheap seafood and supper, the small jetty with daily ferries that bring you to Pulau Ubin, where you can cycle away in nature, and the less famous and probably more relaxing Changi Beach Park where you can watch planes landing from every few minutes. This beach side town is so small, that everything described above are all within a 10-minute walking distance from this hotel. There are a few resorts that are closer to the nicer parts of this really long stretch of beach, but if you don't have a vehicle to get you to those far-flung resorts, then this hotel is probably best if you prefer to enjoy your staycay on foot.

For foreigners, this is great for you if you're looking for a budget hotel that's not dodgy, with rather good facilities to boot. The only drawback, which could also be its strength, is that it is rather far (25-minute aka S$25 taxi ride) away from downtown, but close to both the airport, the beach, and like mentioned above, nestled in this totally laid back town where you can enjoy the more local/nature activities in Singapore at local prices (not exorbitant cut-throat tourist prices in downtown).

Hotel-wise, we liked it for its clean rooms with functional design that is safe and large enough for the little ones to toddle around. It has two pools - one on the rooftop and the other on the ground floor right beside the breakfast area. The little ones liked feeding the koi fishes, and the free flow of local snacks at the lobby too. Free shuttle buses to/from the airport area available on an hourly basis, but we didn't use it since we didn't want to wait and the cab ride was less then S$10 anyway. Our only gripe was that we got a room with a disappointing, almost completely blocked view of the thick support beams of the building (see our photo)... and probably just a sliver of a glimpse of the pool.

The buffet breakfast was a bit of a letdown but I am very fond of bacon, haha (they don't have any).

After a long flight, waiting for check-in is hard, so I think the staff need to address this.

Room service and requests were attended to quite promptly and the staff were always polite and courteous.

The surroundings is awesome, with the beach literally at your doorstep paired with some amazing food that will blow any foodie's palate away.

Air-con and ceiling mouldy and in need of a good wash/paint. Bed is comfortable enough..but lacked support in the pillows. Most importantly, the front desk upgraded us from a Deluxe Room to a Club Room without telling us. So when we got to the room.. There was nothing in the minibar..only a note that said we can proceed to access the Club Lounge for our refreshments.

But as we were uninformed, my husband called up the concierge to check and true enough, they said.. Even though they've upgraded our room for free. We are not entitled to Lounge access. So no minibar and barred from the lounge. Boohoo. We were also not reminded of our checkout time. But decided to just use the regular 12noon as our own cue to leave.

family,4.0,True,Positive,Great for a stopover. We had a 1 night stop over.  We arrived late in the afternoon and left very early in the morning for our next flight.  We really enjoyed our stayed.  Check in was prompt and friendly. I think what was most appealing to us was the hawkers food stalls very close by within short walking distance.  The food we had was excellent and very well priced.  We were 2 adults and 2 children (9 and 7 yrs old).  We only booked one room.  This was fine for 1 night but it was in exisiting bedding with no extra beds.  We opted for this to save costs.  Our room was very clean and we asked for a seaview.  The view was fine but you couldn't see much.  It didn't matter since we were there for a short visit.  We went straight up for a swim on the roof top pool.  Very Very nice.  I think it would be nice if they would offer some pool service as we really would have loved a cold drink.  The pool was very clean and our kids loved it.  I liked seeing the planes coming into land in the distance.  We were going to use the transfer from the airport but since we would have had to wait an hour we got a taxi.  I think it was around $15 (Singapore dollars) for the taxi.  When we got to the hotel we asked to book in for the first morning transfer and of course it was fully booked.  This was disappointing.  However we got a taxi back which was no problem.  I would definitely stay here again to save high costs at other hotels if only staying for a short stay.

Check-in was a huge pain to be honest. There were two groups in front of me and it was literally half an hour of waiting. Staff did not acknowledge me during this time and one out the back of the office did not come out to open an extra counter. After a lot of air travel ad just wanting to go to bed, it was annoying to be robbed of more sleep time. Breakfast does not open until 630 so I could not take advantage of the free breakfast. i suggest they investigate options for those leaving earlier.

Rooms were small but nice. Clean and tidy. Soundproofing was poor and as a 24 hour travel hotel, I was awoken through the night be people coming and going in the hallway. I suggest upgrading room doors as there is a large gap underneath.

The free bus I took in the morning was semi-controlled chaos. The concierge did not speak good English (disappointing for Singapore) and that din't help. Bags were all thrown into the front few seats of the bus as there was no luggage space or trailer. It took everyone a while to work out that they wanted bags for one terminal on one side and the other side for the other terminals. Passengers were unsure of which terminal they were at (just knew airlines) so this didn't help. That aside, it was a very handy free service.

We tried several options (Operator, room service, ...) but there was no response. Each time we had to go physically to the front desk. They said that they did not hear any calls coming in. Later we recorded the video of our phone calls and showed it to them. The person at the desk apologized and said that when they are attending to other people's calls. It was strange that this happened for calls at 1 AM and 2 AM.
When we took the airport shuttle to the hotel, no one bothered to offer help with unloading the luggage or taking it to the room. Often no smiles or even basic friendliness.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Super Location: close to the airport, Hawker Centre (eateries) and beaches. Quiet rooms We stayed at this hotel, 4 July 2018, room 520.

This property has many positives:

Our room was spacious with a nice bed, clean/crisp linens and decent pillows. The rooms has a good layout: work space, TV station, a large suitcase rack, and a closet (wardrobe) with more space to layout a suitcase, hanging and storage space. Two people will be very comfortable in this space.

The bathroom is also spacious and there is a shower/bathtub set up. Amenities such a toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner and lotion, along with other little useful things are found here. My only complaint is that the shower curtain smelled of mildew, an odour repugnant to me.

Near the TV is a smartphone called Handy, and just about every hotel in Singapore offers these phones. It basically offers guests the ability to make phone calls at no cost, plus have access to all kinds of Singapore attractions and venues information.

There is a large flat screen television, which worked fine and has a decent amount of channels. There is also a small refrigerator, which we didn't use, so can't comment on it.

There is a safety box for your valuables.

The hotel:

There is a nice gym on the property and the rooftop swimming pool is gorgeous and it looks sparkling clean. The views from the rooftop are beautiful, of the sea, the many islands and of the little beach, which guests can walk to.

We didn't use the restaurant, but it looks attractive.

Downstairs, the front desk staff was friendly and efficient. It didn't take long to check in. Later on we exchanged some money, and the gentleman at the desk was very helpful.

The hotel grounds are spacious.

The Hawker Centres (eateries) are less than a five minute walk, which is a big plus. at the Hawkers there is usually a huge variety of good quality Singaporean foods and the cost is extremely low.

I loved being able to see the ocean from our room windows, and I could see a beach nearby.

Apparently, there are also many outdoor activities near the hotel, also a big plus. Too bad I was only transiting as I would have liked to take a stroll on the promenade and gone to the nearby beach (a luxury in Singapore).

Proximity to the airport is also unbeatable!

The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to an from the airport.

The negatives:

The hotel is a little dated and could use a bit of sprucing up, like a paint job, especially the outdoor areas.

The rooms have a musty smell, which is understandable in the high Singapore humidity, but perhaps not turning off the AC completely would alleviate that problem.

The shower curtain had a strong mildew smell, which is very annoying.

The Airport Shuttle:

Instructions how to find the hotel shuttle were not given to us when confirming the reservation, so it was a like a treasure hunt walking all over the arrivals terminal, until we called the hotel and were told to look for the Ground Transportation desk, and then we found it. The service is not frequent, so we waited almost one hour. Once it arrived, the driver was very helpful with our luggage, getting on the bus, and then off the bus on arrival at the hotel. Bus is clean and air conditioned.

The hotel's shuttle TO the airport is also not very frequent, but that did not present a problem for us. We simply took a taxi at our convenience, and cost only $13 to terminal 2.

For exercise try the coastal walk along the beach. There‚Äôs also a short boat trip across the bay to a rustic island. Everything is pretty laid back, but you are still only 20-30 minutes from Changi airport.

The best thing though was the staff. Reiner helped out with some really tricky forward bookings, involving the road and ferry transfers to Tioman. He did that with style and judgement that took the pain out of an otherwise frustrating process.

So it's quite expensive in total.

The worst was the room. It was a NON-smoking room but the entire room smell like cigarette upon walking in. We switched off the AC thinking it might be due to air circulation from the other smoking room. Unfortunately, the bed and pillow smell like cigarette too. I couldn't sleep that night.

For convenient, we decided to stay at the hotel restaurant for dinner. Another disappointment. There was a lack of staff around. It was hard to get hold of anyone when we wanted the service. They forgot to serve our drink. My laksa was not very good. Seafood was very tough and clearly wasn't fresh. My husband claimed the same for his food.

I was surprised that they were using a small bus to carry so many passengers to the airport (in contrast to another hotel which i used to stay). They told us to hold onto our umbella pram as there was a lack of space for all luggages. I refused as the seat was clearly too small to accommodate a tall person + a backpack on the lap + a pram.

Since we have not had the time to take a vacation, I thought the hotel location will be perfect for a staycation and to get away from the downtown crowd during the N.Korea/USA Summit.

All the staff at the hotel made me feel welcome, from the second we stepped into the hotel until we checked in.

I understand that the hotel has been around for a long time (previously was the Le Meridien Changi) and do expect some wear and tear but I am pleasantly surprised that it the building has been well maintained, showing very minimal ageing.

Checked into a Club Room as promised in the email but was told that additional payment was needed to use the Club Lounge facilities, which we made without checking on the email again. Only to realise the whole deal after.

Again, it was an oversight on both the hotel and ourselves. The entire hotel staffs took care of us very well during our stay and had even given us a late check out because of a late flight out.

It is very likely that we will be back again (we really like hanging out at the rooftop pool).

There is always a warm welcome from the staff and the quality of the rooms is usually excellent. There will always be comparisons with other visits when you use a hotel regularly, we have used this upwards of 10 times, both transit and short stays.

If I had a small complaint on this visit, it was the aircon in our room. I am sure however, had I complained they would have changed my room. The breakfast was a big improvement on what I had on my last visit, when I complained it was cold.
Over all, it is a great hotel, but there will always be small glitches.

The hotel is well positioned in an area, not known by many that visit Singapore. The area can keep you amused (on foot) for quite a few days, with some nice walks and plenty of eating and drinking establishments.

At the time of staying (Oct 2017), Changi Village Hawker centre was closed so was a bit limited on food.

Breakfast was included in our rate but as our flight was before breakfast had started, we requested for alternative arrangements to be made. We were provided with a very poor selection in a paper box. As this hotel must cater for lots of people using the airport including airline staff, I expected something much much better.

The hotel's airport shuttle service isn't much cop as there's only one every one and a half hours.  On the other hand, the hotel itself is excellent and really good value.

It might have been nice to have a window to open to let some air in, but the room didn't have that.

Sound proofing needs looking at. The occupants in the room next door were still 'talking' loudly at 1am.

In last 2 days one of duty managers came and offered me change of room but i was so annoyed that i had to refuse.

Only plus point is the location which helps you to relax and have the amazing local food experience. There are unlimited options of food and drinks so you will be confused. Me and my business colleagues had absolute fun for a week.

¬†

It has been some time after my stay at the hotel, and I must say I am truly missing it already.

From the moment I stepped into the hotel till the very day I checkout, it was truly an unforgettable stay.

I would like to compliment the following staff and I hope you may convey my thanks to these excellent service staff in your hotel. I want to compliment Nasihah and hazanah who were manning the reception counter. Even though the queue was long and the constant interruption from guests who wish to have their queries answered impatiently, they managed to churn out a warm and welcoming answer. Amazingly still not forgetting the guests that was being served by them initially. Their professionalism in handling guest is commendable despite the long queue. Kudos to Nabilah and Suzie from the Guest Lounge. Thank you for greeting and serving with a smile. Without fail, both acknowledged & welcomed each guest that visited the lounge. I and my husband felt so welcome. Not forgetting their attention to ensuring guests have plenty of food to eat. Thank you nabilah for your helpful orientation in assuring the food and drinks which was available for Muslim consumption. The flexibility of the hotel system enables me to check about my stay details there in the lounge and it was really fantastic considering I do not have to go to the receptionist. However prior to this, I had an uncomfortable experience at the lounge. The staff stationed at that time was Fazuan if I remembered correctly.I remember reaching the lounge and was clueless what to do. As it was my first time entering the lounge and did not know on how to access it, Wan just observed me from his position in there. There was no assistance or instructions rendered. After entering, I certainly did not feel welcomed and was not sure of what is available to me for Muslim diet. Hence I just took a can of ginger ale similar to what an earlier couple I assumed feeling the unpleasant experience.I only returned to the lounge after I was persuaded by my husband who came to stay with me after work. The same thing happened again to a group of foreign guests who was like me clueless if they could enter the lounge. Fazuan was still manning the lounge access and totally ignored the guest without offering any help. Suzie who was more proactive was in the kitchen at that time. If she was around, I can assume that it will be much more inviting and pleasant experience.

Unfortunately, the sound of aircraft flying nearby can last until past midnight. The rooftop swimming pool looked inviting although we didn't swim but good for relaxing on the deck chairs. We wonder why they have a platform in the pool near the external edge where one may stand and risk falling off the barrier. The breakfast at the Club Lounge is very basic but good enough. It has a wonderful relaxing external siting area with a breezy sea view. There are lots of places to eat around the hotel.

The hotel is close to the airport, an easy and fairly short drive, which is why most choose it. Since Singapore is tiny and easy to navigate I may stay here even if I wasn't waiting on a flight or doing business in the area.

Upon arrival we were greeted and instantly helped with our bags. The staff was friendly enough, although not extremely so. Perfectly efficient and polite, if not warm. The lobby was clean and modern.

The room was....interesting. It was quite spacious and clean. It also featured laminate flooring vs carpet whcih I like from a cleanliness factor. It also had a very large bathroom with what could have been the single best shower I have ever had in my life. The rain-shower head spewed out HUGE amounts of water but not in a hard or painful, ultra high pressure way. It was so refreshing and a reason alone to stay there. The odd thing but the shower had a huge picture window into the bedroom. But that leads me to the odd thing, one wall of the shower was literally a huge window into the bedroom. There was a shade one could pull down but some light could be seen through the sides. If you were sharing a room with someone that wasn't family or significant other it would be disconcerting.

The best part of the hotel for me was the location. On past visitis to Singapore I have always stayed with the other tourists and business people by Orchard or Marina.

, i come from a country, that stands out because of the great service we provide in the hotel industry and in general, and believe me when i say I KNOW what great service is BUT is the first time IN MY LIFE that i encountered someone like him that impressed me in so many ways from the way he handled everything from beginning to the end.
I encounter not one but many problems during my stay and he resolved each and every one of them with such grace and empathy, he even went above and beyond to make sure my stay had a positive change and instead of me writing a bad review i can honestly say now, that it was a pleasurable experience staying in that property more so for the guest service than anything else.
the property is nice however the room need to refurblish but honestly congrats on having on board a staff member like him what a GREAT ASSET to that company!",2018-03-01,PreCovid,1

couple,,False,,"Lack of service lets down an otherwise lovely property We chose this hotel for a relaxing 3 night stopover enroute from Mongolia to Australia. We chose it because of it's lovely pool and quiet location close to the beach and Pulau Ubin. The location and pools did not disappointment. The hotel is a stone's throw from the Pulau Ubin ferry terminal and the Changi Village hawker centre, the source of excellent, cheap street food.
The other reason we chose it was its free airport shuttle as we arrived in Changi airport at 10.30 pm. Despite sending and email 2 days in advance of our arrival asking about how to use this service, I had no reply. It wasn't obvious how to do this at the airport so we ended up with a $20 taxi fare to the hotel.
Despite booking a double room, I noted on checking in that the invoice said ""twin"" room. When I queried that, I was assured it was a twin room. Same sex couples beware. Had someone made an executive decision based on our names? I asked for the room to be changed and it was but we were demoted a floor and I am sure our requested sea view was demoted to ""sea glimpses"".
The room itself was clean and resonably spacious. The bathroom had a bath (always a plus for me) and a rainfall shower and hand shower combo. However the amenities were rather lacking. Basic hotel toiletries, one tiny cake of cheap hand soap, one towel each, bath slippers but no bathrobes, two teabags, two coffees, plastic stirrers, mugs not cups and saucers, water glasses but no wine glasses, dairy creamer ... you get my drift. Basic.
The hotel has two pools, not one. Both are lovely and well maintained. It would be great if the one on the ground floor could be made a child-free zone. And while you are at it, this pool needs an entrance that isn't through the restaurant - not a good look in one's cozzies - and some kind or arrnagement with the golf club next door not to manicure the 18th hole in the middle of the day. Our enjoyment of the pool was greatly reduced by leaf blowers running up and down the fence blowing leaves and dust at us for hours. An asthmatic could be in real peril here.
But where this hotel falls down is the lack of personable service. Our interactions with staff were brief and efficient when needed, but no one went out of their way to inquire if we were enjoying our stay or needing anything. This makes the place seem rather soulless. Even while lying by the pool next to the bar for a few hours no one approached us or the other guests there, to ask if we would like a drink or a snack. This is a missed business opportunity, apart from anything else.
I would use this hotel again as it's in a part of Singapore I really like ... away from the hustle and bustle and close to the airport. Maybe it is better suited to business guests?

Pros:

- Choice of places to eat near the hotel, many good value eateries and 7 Eleven

- Nice, friendly staff

- Room was very spacious, clean and comfortable, even including a mobile phone that you could use to make calls/find information. I was impressed with that.

- Bathroom was nice, with a bath

- Plenty of bottled water available in the lobby and two in the room

- WiFi was good

Cons:

- It is great that the airport shuttle is provided for free. It would be good to have more frequent departures in the morning, or a different system. It says in the hotel literature that guests with departing flights are prioritised but the receptionist said that‚Äôs not the case and it‚Äôs purely first come first serve. That‚Äôs fair enough, but the early morning minibus had already filled up by the time we checked in at 6pm and tried to put our names down, so worth being aware of that

- our neighbours were paying loud music until late, which was audible through the wall

So I unfortunately had to stay in the UK over Christmas. This time of year the UK is horrible, cold, wet and dark. I just needed to get away to my favorite warm sunny bolt hole. The Village Hotel at Changi - and the last week in Jan 2018 opened up nicely for me - so I committed.

Arrived at the Hotel a bit late due to a 2 hour flight delay. Check in was efficient and fast and I was up in my exec club room on the 6th floor in no time. Sheda the club manager had left a note and some cans of diet coke as a nice welcome back present.

For me the Village Hotel is about Location. Changi Village is off the beaten path it is not the city. In fact its like stepping back in time to a less busy Singapore. Its also not in the least touristy - their motto is ""Live Like a Local"" and that suites me down to a ""T"".

Slight problem on the first night. Children were running between rooms at past mid-night, slamming doors as they went. Not just occasionally - it seemed like all the time. I just couldn't get to sleep because of the noise. For the first time in my life I had to ring the Night Manager and complain. They acted quickly and within 10 mins everything settled down - that is until 5am when it started again. This time I got up and opened my door and too my surprise, hotel staff were in the corridor ""handling"" the situation.

The hotel can't control what other guests or their children get up to, but they reacted when asked and managed the situation well. So well done and thank you. The rest of my stay was quiet and relaxed. Good food, friendly staff (and locals), great location.

Breakfast is ok and service is good.

The main differentiator for this hotel to even get three stars is the fantastic can do attitude of all the staff. From extra beds in the room to extra water et al; we got prompt friendly service.

This year I was pleased to come back and find the place as enjoyable as it was before.  Its location is perfect for late night or early morning flights from Changi International airport at 4.2 K away.   It is located in a small residential neighborhood on the outskirts of Singapore called Changi Village.   The hotel offers fantastic water views from the higher floors and the pool on the roof. The other side of the hotel overlooks a golf course..so a nice view from there as well. It is also across the street from the bumboat ferry to Pulau Ubin and numerous hawker type foodstalls.  Upon arrival, check in was very quick and easy.  My travel companion was handicapped so the check in person was careful to put us in a room close to the elevator.  We stayed on the club level floor  (where I usually stay) which offers breakfast from 6:30- 10 am or so, and a cocktail hour from 6-8 pm.   I was very pleased to see that a few people working there  I had met before remembered me, (even my name) and were happy to see me again.....

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Better Than Quincy It was December and I stayed at two hotels under the menagement of Far East Organization and there is definitely a stark contrast in terms of service between the two.

In terms of concept, Changi offers more for families and service. At least there was staffs awaiting guests arrival at its drop-off. This is critical as travellers/staycationers who travels with luggage(s) or on wheelchair like me, depends on assistance from hotel personnels. The only qualm i had was the lack of effort from the security guy who approached our taxi driver and asked if there was any luggage from our side. He should have quickly help him with the wheelchair instead. And speed of checking in coupd have been better with all four counter up and running to expedite things up. Besides, it was super peak and hotels all over should know they will be spam with throngs of guests thus plannings should have been done to curb with such situations. Nonetheless our queue did not crawl or halt and we managed to check in 20 minutes later.

Room and bathroom was definitely more spacious and well placed/organised compared to Quincy's. It was just a tad dated.

I was impressed with the request i made prior arrival for a small cake prior arrival. The reservations team really took note and was commited as the speacial celebration cake for my wife's birthday surprise was brought in moments after we step into our room after check in. A stark difference from our previous stay at Quincy as their staffs send up our Anniversary cake at 8pm, 5 hours after checking in despite our request of upon arrival. They did reasoned that the caje was delivered in the evening when we were not around, but was it our fault that we were out for dinner and that our room has to be on ""do not disturb"" as there were valuables? A letter stated their efforts to send up the amenities did not do justice as their tardiness could have been better. Nontheless, it was a small issue we did not want to dwell and pursue. However the recent defensive comments by their management irks me as i find it disappointing to how their respond was and lack of empathy says a lot about their professionalism.

Back to Village Hotel Changi. Swimming pool is definitely more interesting as it is wider and there was the fun factor. Depth was separated in 3 different section of 0.5m, 1.2m and a jacuzzi concept. And at 1st level, there is another pool available that resembles more to an infinity type with a see through glass wall.

Buffet spread. All i can say there is decent variety for the less fussy. My take is go for breakfast at the nearby food centre.

Feedback: Please add some bath robes, more towels and perhaps some sort of mural(s) to decorate the wall right above the bed head. All in all, a recommended place for families as the location is great and accommodation is fine.",2018-01-01,PreCovid,1

Rooms are comfy and reasonably clean (except the room I had in exec suite, the bathtub there's crack and the tap isn't working), some of rooms are not carpeted. the exec suite I've got is carpeted, but my parents room in the Royal Suite is not. Personally we prefer hotel rooms that are carpeted. There's also technical fault in my room as some of the power point isn't working. Hence, the rooms need updated.

We had our dinner & breakfast at the Saltwater Cafe, the buffet spread is acceptable, hence some of the food is served cold. Quality of food is delicious. My Family is consist of 2 handicapped people, both wheelchair bound. Staff at the cafe is very good they help to set up the ram efficiently and push both of them one at a time. I would say 'A' for service. Since we are in the executive suite, we are able to access the club lounge on the 6th floor, the pastries not much of a variety but the beverages selection is good.

family,5.0,True,Positive,"Wonderful Experience With Family @ Village Hotel Village Hotel Changi would be an ideal place for a weekend family staycation. We had a truly wonderful experience there where all the hotel staffs are helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and tidy. We booked the Club with Club Benefits room where we were entitled to breakfast and an all day access to the Club Lounge. The amenities is also good which consist of the rooftop swimming pool with seaview for a relaxing moment.

I would say the breakfast was good and the variety was wide. Omelettes were freshly made upon order and you can add cheese, chicken ham, etc. And in case you are too lazy to go down for breakfast, the ones served in the Club Lounge is pretty good as well. They serve various types of croissants, omelettes, local kway teow / nasi lemak and even pancakes. There's also an espresso machine which brews your coffee instantly. Add generous portions of fresh hot milk to make your coffee creamier.

Finally, I would like to give a special shoutout to hotel staff Shaik & Koreen. I would like to thank them for the kindest and friendliest service that they have provided my family. We ended up becoming friends. Koreen attended to me when I checked in. She arranged for the 5 rooms we booked to be close to each other and on the same level. She was also very nice enough to inform me that the restaurant serving breakfast is halal certified. On top of that, she notified me that there is alcoholic drinks served in the Club Lounge but the food is from the halal kitchen. It is thoughtful gestures like this that makes us feel secure and comfortable. It shows that she understands the customers' concerns. As for Shaik, he had rendered assistance for the queries that I have. He even provided suggestions to the activities that I can do during our staycation there. To be honest, I do not know Changi much, but Shaik recommended few good nearby places which I could visit for good food as well as fun family activities. I would also like to thank him for going the extra mile to send our breakfast voucher to my room. Although it is beyond his line of duty, this extra effort placed made us feel more welcomed during our stay there. To add on the final bit, I would like to commend Shaik for his level of patience in dealing tough and demanding a customer during my checkout date. I have to say that it is everyone's burden to handle difficult customers. Basically, that customer was trying to squeeze everything that she could from the Hotel and holding up the queue. But Shaik handled the situation well by simply keeping cool and composed while still maintaining a smile dealing with that particular customer.

In all, I would say that both Koreen and Shaik are a valuable asset to the organisation with their exceptional customer service skills and standard. This is the thing that gives a 4-star hotel, a 5-star grading.",2017-12-01,PreCovid,0

The reception staff at check in were warm and friendly. We were shown to our rooms which were clean and bright. The rain shower in the bath room was a bonus.

The variety of food available was mind boggling! The Changi village hawker centre was a destination itself! Nasi lemak, bak chor mee, beef noodle, satay, hokkien fried prawn noodles and all washed down with sweet sugar cane! Dessert was goreng Pisang! From 3 different stalls, mind you...each better than the last!

An evening walk along the boardwalk ended with a spectacular sunset view at the end of the boardwalk. Along the way we saw parakeets and kingfishers! Missed the hornbill the weekend that we were there, and neither did we see the others. But the beautiful coastal walk more than made up for it. When we returned to the hotel, we took a ride up to the topmost floor and managed to catch another lovely view of the coast.

I was due to meet up with some Chinese friends that I hadn't seen in nearly 30 years. I was able to wash and brush up before returning to the crowded and busy reception area, to wait in the queue in front of the reception desk. I noticed a young bell boy loading luggage into a waiting taxi, and approached him and asked directions to Chinatown, my place of rendevous. After listening to his instructions twice, he finally asked if he could write them down, which he did clearly and completely. No.29 bus from the stop over there, get off at Tampines Central bus station, walk under the covered way to the Mass Transport Railway, and take the train to Chinatown on the Downline. So a very good first impression of this well-located hotel and in particular, its very helpful staff. So why only 4 blobs for my score?
Well, in the end it was small things. There was a broken fitting over the bathroom, which did not afford an easy, comfortable shower-head position, requiring the user to have Houdini-like abilities, to use successfully. The television remote didn't work, requiring a change of commander. When repacking the cloths I had worn over my 3 day visit they were soaking wet, or very damp when I picked them off the floor of the wardrobe. It was only then I noticed water weeping from an earlier repair, which had clearly failed. As it was 03.30am, and I had a plane to catch to New Zealand on an early flight out of Changi, the best I could do was to try to iron the articles dry, and use plenty of tissue and plastic bags to continue my journey. So details; small but important details. Nevertheless, the cheerful and friendly cleaning staff kept their rooms in tip-top condition, the breakfast was efficiently run, and offered a good range of options, and the hotel's location in one of the few remaining post-Colonial areas, is charming and allows access to a range of good eateries in close-by Changi village, 3 minutes walk away, access to a fabulous coastal walk, and importantly, free and efficient transfers from the airport and back.

There is a free shuttle that takes you to the city center, however, there is no free shuttle that you can take to get back. It was at least a 25 minute taxi ride and the cab driver was not so fluent in the English language that it was hard to communicate.

There are eateries within a two minute walk of the hotel. There is a free shuttle to and from the airport which is a big plus. If you must stay at this hotel, review the MRT or Train schedules as it can save you a bunch of money in cab fares. Non-peak hours, the cab will only cost you about 20 dollars including tip or 2 dollars. Bugis Junction is the place to shop bargains. It is welcome to haggle on the price even at some department stores. Take the hop on hop off tour of the city first before engaging on any tours.

The other let down on the second occasion (November 20th - 24th) was the breakfast. I think after paying the $20 Singapore, plus service charge, it should at least be hot. On the two occasions we had breakfast, it was spoilt for this reason alone.

Check in was quite laborious and time consuming - something I had never experienced in Singapore - or any other Asian hotel - before.  The room smelt very musty - and remained so for quite a few hours until the airconditioning cleared the air.  To have a hot shower you almost needed a cut lunch lunch and water bottle as you had to wait so long for the hot water to actually start running through the system.Room servicing was a little questionable as we returned to our room one afternoon at 4 p.m.(having left at 8 a.m.) and the cleaning/remaking of the room had only just been completed (the staff were leaving our room as we arrived.)  We didn't use the room service available nor the dining options as the costs were quite excessive - yet the hotel is located a pleasant 3 minute stroll to one of the best open air food markets I've seen in a long time.The opportunity to utilise a free-of-charge mobile phone for Internet access and phone call to Australia was very much appreciated - and utilised. Overall, the Hotel was pretty mediocre - being dominated by Chinese tourists who have little time to exercise basic courtesies for other guests.

Service was up-and-down - some service staff were fantastic and hospitable, whilst others were as welcoming as a winter's night (kind of felt like they were just there because it is their job). I only remembered the ""host"" at Saltwater Cafe was very friendly and smiling as he showed us to our table during breakfast (18/11/2017 at about 1030hrs). The rest of the service staff (or at least those we encountered) at Saltwater Cafe that morning was glum. Housekeeping were very friendly and always greeted any guests who walked past them. Front Office staff were pretty nice too though 1 or 2 could use a smile.

However, the breakfast at Saltwater Cafe was not good. The best food was honestly the hashbrown. At the ""egg station"" you had to hope the write ""cook"" cooked your omelette (for the record, have your eggs cook by the male as the female Indian cook whose omelettes were so bland and attitude like she does not acknowledge your presence was a spoiler).

Rooms wise, comfortable and everything was mostly working though we did not sleep comfortably for most of the time because the toilet in one of our rooms (and it is only that particular room) had a constant banging sound (like renovation works - hammer, etc.) throughout. The logical explanation was vents/pipes (but of course, we didn't buy that). Nonetheless, that and other ""incidents"" caused us to change rooms, and that was much better. The staff were nice enough to help us change in the wee hours of the morning - and no, I am not going to mention the other incidents (though of the 3 rooms, that 1 particular room was the ""problematic"" one).

Offer them in and let them have a seat, while you take down their room no. and do a quick check with your room reservation/front counter team. First outcome: If indeed these guests are, then you will clearly realise that their issued cards were not activated during check in earlier. So you may 1) offer to take their cards and get it activated on their behalf (which they will be very grateful for), OR 2) honour them their time in the lounge while politely advising them to go to the check in desk for assistance AFTER enjoying their refreshments. Second outcome: if in fact the guests do not belong under Club, quickly return and politely advise them where they may go to have some light refreshments instead (eg to your Saltwater Caf√© etc). This is the LEAST you can do.

Now for the Club Lounge, again. At about 4pm, we wanted to enjoy some light refreshments when a group of ‚Äústarving‚Äù 5 other guests came and literally vacuuming whatever there was left to offer. My mum was about to reach out for a croissant when one of the staff appeared and took the entire pastry platter away! No return! So there she was, empty handed and there was NO other food on the table. Not a single finger food. You had 2 food trays ‚Äì empty. There were only some soft drinks and coffee/tea. Seriously guys, you HAVE to know what Club Lounge is about. I paid extra to enjoy this benefit but honestly I do not understand what I had paid for. Rather undervalued. I couldn‚Äôt help but to say that I really wished I had booked at those other establishments that I‚Äôve stayed at before.",2017-11-01,PreCovid,1

Checking in was relatively easy but I must say the woman behind the counter could be a little more friendlier.

Room was small and basic. The window from the toilet opening out to the room is really a very bad idea.
The blinds is not at all light proof and when the toilet light is switched on, it also makes the room bright as day. Why put a window there??

The room temperature is almost the same as the North Pole. We adjusted the thermostat to the slowest fan speed and even turned up the temperature wheel to 30¬∞c but it seems only the on/off switch works.

Regularly in the night, sounds from God knows where will appear. There is what sounds like a leaf blower being switched on and off randomly which seems to come from above us but we are on the 7th floor so I don't know what is upstairs.
When the shower is turned on, it sounds like a machine gun being shot.

The toilet is in very very bad shape.
The sink and bath tub have crack marks that have collected dirt over the years.

The shower heads all have lime lining all around.

Thankfully this hotel was not a choice that we decided upon, it was chosen by the employer and also we are moving out in a day or 2.

My wife booked the hotel to have a small gathering for my birthday.

And upon reaching the Hotel we were greeted by Mr Shaik who was very warm and welcoming and also greeted us by our names as if he was anticipating us!

The room was decorated with a birthday card and also credited with more success in the hotel like it's club executive lounge which is on the same level and boasts an awesome and eventful breakfast buffet for people like me who would like to stay on my floor most of the time. Anyways as the day went on, I called Mr Shaik to notify him that I will be having guests and he took the initiative to give a call to me when my guest arrived and showed them to where I was.

After taking a swim in the hotel infinity pool I went back to my room and just enjoyed the sea view at the balcony when suddenly Mr Shaik showed up to my doorstep and presented me with a birthday cake! I really think he really outdone himself in just one day, but he is one of the reasons that really made my stay awesome!

Every staff member with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind including the guys which came and knock our room with a slice of cake and candle which make us even more happy because its was the thoughts that counts from you guys. We have already decided to return for a staycay again soon.

couple,,False,,"Good location, shame the hotel has been allowed to deteriorate We stayed 7 nights recently. On arrival at the airport at night we faced an hour and a half wait for the hotel shuttle bus so opted for a taxi. As the hotel isn't that far from the airport the bus really could be more frequent as it is a popular transit hotel.
We last stayed at this hotel in 2005 and enjoyed it so much that's why we chose it for this visit. The location in Changi village is much quieter, greener and less bustle than the city which suits us. However, we were saddened to see the deterioration of the hotel. Of course everywhere gets wear and tear but it just seemed somewhat neglected. The rooms are basic, cleanish, a bit of mould in bathroom. The window overlooking Changi golf course was shocking, covered on the lower half of the outside with green moss/mould. Not a good look!
The water pressure in the sink tap was barely able to rinse soap from my hands and took forever to get hot. The shower is good. The beds were the best, so comfy and the bedding was cosy but cool. We slept so well. The aircon is very noisy. We had it off most of the time and the room stays cool which was good. The room cleaning staff were pleasant and obliging and they replenish bottled water daily which was much appreciated.
Reception staff were efficient. That's about it, not overly welcoming. Only had the buffet breakfast the first morning. It was terrible, poor quality and strange variety. The coffee machine makes a tiny amount of ? freshly ground coffee needing a reasonable amount of milk of which was only available cold and tasted like long life milk. The staff weren't great in there. The restaurant was grubby looking with dirty scuff marks on lower areas and thick dust on higher areas that is very obvious when you are looking out of the lifts. Harry's Bar is attached to the hotel and have a great selection of beers and wines and is good for lunch and dinner with excellent upbeat staff. We prefer to eat at the local cafes and hawker centre where we got excellent food everywhere we went. Apart from coffee!
The pool on the rooftop is great and clean. Views excellent. A plane spotters delight overlooking the landing path to the airport! There are only 10 seats/sunbeds though and many people, including us get up there at times only to have to leave straight away as there is nowhere to sit which is a shame. Weekend evenings seem to get loud partygoers in the pool with their bottles of beer and water resistant smart phones blaring music. I suppose that is a random thing depending who is staying there at the time. Staff walking past seemed ok with people in the pool with bottles and didn't bat an eyelid!? On the whole the rooftop pool is a drawcard for the hotel though.
Taxis are easy to get out the front and the doorman is very friendly.
The wifi is seriously more miss than hit which was frustrating.

Despite not having the king bed, they joined the two singles together. Thank you to the housekeeper who did it!! We arrived at the room at the same time, so I got to see how it was done.

The far walk from the lift to the room. Haha! Some rooms are on the other side of the hotel! But further from the lift lobby is better, means lesser human traffic, means quieter; although my neighbours weren't so quiet... :)

The channels on the television were great! Appealed to the masses, really.

Getting free parking with the receptionist was a pleasant experience as well.

Friendly. Checking out was fast! :)

Location is near all the yummilious foods! The beach nearby. Near the airport as well, especially where planes fly over to land but do not really hear the planes approaching, which is something I thought would be quite loud - maybe the trees blocked off the sound.

The shock I had when I looked out of my window and realised that my neighbours on their balcony could see the inside of my room. Yikes! Had to keep the curtains closed at all times.
And though they said it was a no smoking room, they were smoking on the balcony, I guess that is fine... (I don't smoke; I don't smell it while they were smoking either)

I thought the pool upstairs was fantastic with the views over the sea and little ferry with an incredible view of the planes coming in but without the noise. I did however get very burnt which was my own fault as I underestimated the exposure to the sun as I was enjoying it so much and there was no real shade at mid day time in the pool, so do take care.
I did not have breakfast or a meal as it was not very inviting and neither am I a fan of Halal methods. I recommend The Civil service Centre opposite or Tangs Tea House or Olden Street in Changi Village Hawkers - all very good and reasonable.
I was impressed with the Hotel's thoughtfulness in letting me into the Gym to shower and change after the pool to make my transfer to the airport so that is why I rate them excellent. They knew I was checked out and did not have access to a room but were still considerate and thoughtful enough to find me a space easier than just the ladies Loo to change in after use of the pool.

The taxi situation was a shambles too, we ordered one from our room in the morning as we had been advised to the night before.
When we came down to reception with our luggage there were people squabbling over who had ordered what taxi, they both eventually went off on their way and then it become apparent that actually one of them had taken our taxi.

The receptionist was lovely and ordered us an uber on her own account bless her as apparently there were no city taxi's available (odd) but still just seemed unusual for a hotel to not be organised in that sense.

We were only staying here as an airport stop over thankfully and in all honesty for a quick 1 nighter it ticked a box or two.

One good point is that there was a really informative channel on the TV that was advertising what Singapore city had to offer and where to go/ what to do. We took some of those tips with us for the way back (when we stayed in the city).

Imagine my delight upon opening the door to my room and finding a wow! upgrade before me. True splendour and luxury. I cannot thank the hotel enough (which I did emphatically!) for this lovely surprise.

I had reserved a Club Room and the benefits were well worth the extra. Welcoming staff in the Lounge, particularly Miss Suzie Suratman who was charming and attentive. My request for a small breakfast item that was not available in the Exec Lounge was quickly granted and reserved for me each day. The Happy Hour provided delicious light bites plus alcohol drinks in a delightful setting, on the outdoor terrace listening to and watching the birds and leafy green scenery. The shipping channel was a constant entertainment as was the aircraft coming in to land. Comfortable seating and attentive waiters made this a go to place each evening.

There are several restaurants in the hotel as well as the hawker centre nearby. I needed a power adaptor as I had left mine at home. The Concierge directed me to several small shops nearby where I easily found what I was looking for. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel shuttle back to the airport was an effortless experience.

couple,,False,,"Cosy/Restful Accommodation with Generous Space We checked in on Sat 19 Aug.
The process was straight-forward, professionally handled by a cheerful Christine.
The room was spacious with a king-size bed, seats designed along the window, and the bathroom door has pegs to hang you clothes .. something quite lacking in many hotels.

The WiFi was strong.
I was especially surprised by the ""complimentary mobile phone"" that was waiting to be used by its occupants.
Apart from free local calls, you could also surf the Internet to check/find stuff, including free calls to a few countries. Would have been great is they could have include New Zealand as one of the countries.

The bed had clean sheets, the shower worked well.

I just want to highlight the following for the management to take note of,
#1: Water from showering, somehow leaks out onto the floor. The floor mat would be soaking wet after 1 bath. I tired to ""seal"" the shower curtain to the side of the wall to stem this but without success
#2: Build into the check-in routine to inform guests about the ""Gift Voucher"" of the bicycle ride/chicken rice/Bowling Game/Ferry ride to Pulau Ubin.
I chanced to find out when I asked about where I could rent bicycles from the Front Desk.

I must say that I very seldom do ""staycation"" stints.
But I must say that my recent stay at Village Hotel Changi has changed my perception.

My take is this,
Village Hotel Changi has very much going for them.
- the rustic nature of Changi Village just a stones throw away is already a big bonus, especially for those who want to get-away-from-it-all
- the eateries around, including the Changi Village Hawker Centre compliments the restaurants in the hotel, affording guests with food options, especially the local fare
- the facilities available at the Changi Civil Service Club, just opposite the hotel where you can bowl or karaoke till late
- the Boardwalk with great sunset that you find when you visit countries on your travels
- the cycle track at the beach nearby to see the belly of planes landing at Changi Airport .. a truly up-close-&-personal experience
- the airport-hotel transfer both ways is most helpful

I will readily recommend this hotel to anyone.",2017-08-01,PreCovid,1

family,5.0,True,Positive,Pleasant stay for family and wheelchair user We were looking for a staycation to relax and get away from the city life. I am a wheelchair user so flying out of Singapore can be quite a hassle. We booked Village hotel @ Changi and had a very pleasant stay. The check-in was smooth and the front desk staffs were very accomodating and friendly. They ensured i have all my needs met. We took the junior suite to ensure i have space for my wheelchair and i had no trouble moving around the hotel and around the room. Room was spacious and clean. They even provided a little device to access the internet which i thought was a plus point. The kids spent their time at the infinity pool at the rooftop which had a kiddy and adult pool. I heard there is even another pool at the first floor but we didn't have time to explore that. We also dropped by the Changi beach for the sand play and playground which was about 10 mins walk. Plenty of eating places just next to the hotel which is great for money saving. We stocked up on titbits and bottled drinks from the market which was a mere 5 mins walk away. Overall we had a very pleasant experience at the hotel due to the available amenities nearby. My kids had fun at the pool and beach. I was a wheelchair user but did not experience any difficulties getting around.,2017-08-01,PreCovid,1
,,False,,Something different in Singapore If you are sick of Orchard Road and crowded Singapore this is a great quiet option.  The hotel is solidly four star so if luxury is your motivation don't bother.  However for good value for money less than 100 meters from great outdoor restaurants and hawker areas the hotel is wonderful.  For aviation buff a walk of 500 meters to Changi Beach will afford a great view of incoming aircraft.  Buses are easy and plentiful from the nearby terminus.

I didn't eat at the hotel but the outlets looked busy and well priced.

It may be ten minutes away as the crow flies , but at 3.30 a.m.it was a good half an hour or more drive by Taxi, a journey that cost $40.00 and was tiring in itself after a long flight.

Came across this hotel and immediately decided to make it two nights instead because the area looked so inviting.  Very glad that I did because it really was very relaxing.  There is a lot to do, with very nice beaches along with hiking and biking trails.  There are also frequent ferries to neighboring islands such as Pulau Ubin, which are well worth exploring  Overall, it really felt a million miles from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Despite being very close to the airport, aircraft noise was not an issue. The hotel was good and the staff very pleasant and helpful.  However, the hotel is in need of some refurbishment and refreshing.  Room was large and clean, with decent facilities and comfortable bed.  Several restaurants and bars within the hotel, and there are numerous places to eat within a 5 minute walk. The area is very busy on the weekend with lots of families and a nice atmosphere. Not loud or a party town. Definitely quieter on the Monday (several restaurants are closed on Mondays - but still many places to eat)    For people on a layover, this beats staying in and around the airport, as you can really get away and relax.  There is a hotel shuttle bus running to/from all the airport terminals. Arriving in terminal one, turn left as you come out of customs and follow signs for hotel and limousine shuttles - walk as far as you can go will, the desk will be on your right side.

Booked a superior room.Presented my print out to the counter and after taking hubby's and my id to do all necessities, the lady advised amount to pay. Advised that i had made payment and she kept saying that system indicated as reserve n gave the amount to pay..

I had to present my email and showed e receipt and after some time she said she will settle it. Was pissed as there were queues behind and beside us.

Had requested for smoking and room with view..we were advised that ours is a room with 2 single bed and she asked if we wanted to merge the bed as there was no available room with large bed ready..we said that it would be great..

Came up to the room with bed still separated, no ash tray and we had problem trying to get the top shower to be unabled and we kept getting wet..

The importance of it to be off is because we had to climb up the bathtub to shower and with the top fixed shower on, it is dangerous as i have my 2 small kids and my girl had slipped when she was up there in the tub.

The receptionist said she will send a technician down when all i requested for any housekeeping to assist..this was not solved till we checked out.

Was not advised that the lift works on card acess and there was no sign or whatsoever..lucky i had brought the card down when i went to buy food or it would have troublesome.

business,,False,,"too expensive for what they deliver I was staying at Village Hotel Changi in August during a week long meeting. After looking at the location map my first though was it is located well near the airport. But it's right on the other side of it. It took 35 min for the shuttle bus to reach it. That is almost the same time you would need to reach downtown. The room was clean, but the walls were paper thin. I could hear everything for my neighbor including this ringing phone on vibration mode. The fact the the runway is not far away doesn't make it better. Sleeping was a challenge. On arrival night I tried the buffet BBQ at the Saltwater hotel restaurant. I was hungry and thirsty after some hours of travel. For 50 SGD I thought is might work. So I ordered it, took some food and also ordered a beer. There was no sign anywhere that this Hotel restaurant it actually a Halal place. So no beer. Unacceptable if you asked me, they should at least mention it. First night in the room, TV couldn't show any tv channel. All were dead. After ""repair"" there were TV channels, but on a very bad signal quality. The worker then told me that is normal and it's that bad everywhere in the Hotel.
There is free WIFI, terrible slow and I had to reconnect at least once per day, even it was asking me how long I am going to stay in the first place. The service quality of the staff was under average, too. Everywhere in the building I've noticed staff with a very bad mood. Breakfast staff, cleaners or reception. There is a bar attached to the hotel, but when we used it after dinner (outside of the hotel) they could bot book the bill to the rooms (what was actually the idea to go there initially). Final story: the invoice. It took 45 min for them to issue a correct invoice. Several typos, claims that the address is too long etc etc etc. My colleague missed breakfast and the shuttle bus because of that.

However two things really let down this hotel. While overall the hotel was clean, there were a couple of disappointing oversights. The bathroom has a sliding door and it was obvious the floor underneath where the door slides open had not been cleaned for a long time as it was piled up with dust and other debris. Obviously housekeeping only ever cleans the bathroom with the door open, which is a rookie error given that guests will almost always use the bathroom with the door closed.

The rooftop infinity pool had a glass wall which also had obviously not been cleaned for a long time. It seems pointless to even have an infinity pool if the glass is so dirty that guests in the pool can't even see the view anyway.

Likewise the follow through on service requests at reception was very poor. On the first night we requested a second mug from reception for tea and coffee as only one had been provided in our room. This never arrived. On the second night we ran out of toilet paper and requested more from reception. Again it never came.

My first stay I only waited 25 minutes at the airport but the second time it took over an hour for the shuttle to appear. In addition, the driver was grumpy and given to tossing luggage (I grabbed my camera bag and held it in my lap). On the good side, there are numerous great food courts around the corner with everything from traditional seafood to a hamburger with a fried egg on top!

It is ideal for those who know Singapore already or are simply transiting. If you are visiting Singapore for the first time, don't stay in this hotel.You will be disappointed since the city center is quite far.
I stayed in Singapore downtown for 3 days for a conference so I choose this hotel to get a two day mini vacation feeling. The views are very pretty, towards the sea, tropical greenery and the island of Palau Ubud. The rooftop pool is excellent as is the nearby Changi beach. Not ideal for swimming but for jogging, cycling, walking. Many good and authentic restaurants nearby. Very safe. Will get a different feeling of SIngapore.
The hotel is slightly older, would need a bit of refurbishment , but the price is very good. I got upgraded to a big suite and had access to the Executive Lounge. The offered bonuses are really worth it, esp. the free bicycle rental and a 2 hours voucher for airport lounge.

Firstly, there is not much information on the hotel executive lounge such as its prices and how we will be charged (per entry or per day). The only information is a note in our room's fridge to advise customers to go to the lounge for snacks and drinks. We past by the lounge several times but it seems that the lounge is accessible to exclusive group of customers only.

Secondly, Village Hotel Changi has 2 vending machines that visitors can purchase food at a reasonable price (if you do not want to eat at the hawker centre or restaurants).

We had stayed in this hotel previously a few years back and since we had a memorable experience the last time round we decided to return. To our disgust, the rooms looked unmaintained. There were stains on the mirror and the windows were stained with fungi. The cupboard doors to the mini bar was falling off and the floor felt sandy. I nearly decided to leave the hotel but not before unleashing my frustration to the hotel staff.

Ms Halinah, the staff who checked me in, coincidentally was the duty manager. Despite the heavy check in, she took the time to look into the matter, listened to my rants, empathize on my situation and provided various suggestions to appease me. Eventually, we were upgraded and we were really pleased for what she had done for us.

1. I would like to highlight that Ms Halina, was professional in handling our situation and remained calm and pleasant throughout the whole time we complained. She is definitely a valuable staff for the hotel because if not for her, we would have definitely left and never ever come back.

2. The hotel rooms (smoking rooms in particular) look really tired and unmaintained to the point it looks creepy.

On arrival the staff were helpful, polite and very well presented. as we were on our Honeymoon the manager very kindly upgraded our room to an executive suite - which gave us access to the executive lounge (would highly recommend upgrading on booking). Our room was very clean had wonderful toiletries and an incredibly comfortable bed!

We whipped down the road and found a 24 hour supper club - which was delicious. The surroundings were clean and safe even after midnight when we were strolling around. The beach is about a 5-10 minute walk from the Hotel and there is a fantastic craft brewery in close proximity. They also have the Changi Village Hawkers market across the road - but as we arrived so late we missed the opportunity to go.

In the morning I was able to make use of their well equipped and air conditioned gym. It was large with sweeping windows, plenty of machines and space and very clean. The pool is on the roof and offers fabulous views out to the water. It was cool and clean - it was just assume that we didn't have much time to enjoy it. They also have another pool by the restaurant on the ground floor.

This is a very busy transit hotel which must serve thousands of people in a week but nothing has been spent on the hotel for a while so things are becoming tired.

For example, To work out in the gym is very difficult as it is a small space, the aircon is poor and there is a dehumidifier running constantly so the air is also very dry and the ceiling is very low so some exercises are a no no.

The internet is awful and you have to know the areas of the hotel that it works room 664 not being high up on the list. I have mentioned this to the staff on many occasions and have also used the feed back form on a number of occasions to no avail.

Some really good local delicacies can be found at the food centre at a relatively cheap price.

The counter staff invited us to the lounge for some drinks while we wait. We were informed that the room will be ready in 15 mins. However, we were still waiting after close to an hour later. The hotel did made a great service recovery by offering us an free upgrade of our Dulex Club Room to a Junior Suite.

The Junior Suite was spacious and clean, with huge toilet equipped with rain shower and bath tube.The staff even went the extra mile to setup some simple decoration on the bed as the stay was for my birthday celebration. What impressed me more was that the staff at the lounge greeted me happy birthday when we went to the lounge shortly after check-in.

There were 2 swimming pools in the hotel, an infinity pool at the roof and a creek pool beside the restaurant. For the infinity pool, if there is a solemnization event on, you will need to walk through the guests as there is only one way to access the pool, which is through the event area. We were shocked when out lift door opens to a crowd of guests attending the solemnization event, and we were dressed in our bath robes! For the creek pool, it is situated right beside the restaurant and it may be awkward to have diners staring at you while you swim. Hence, it will be wise to choose a good timing to visit the pools.

We love the rooms. we were staying in room 726. the highest floor for the hotel guest room I guest.... it was amazing. the bathroom was always clean. and the the place never fail to make our place a memorable one. once of the best thing was the swimming pool. we went twice. 3rd july and the 4th july. the pool was a super relaxing place to be... very cosy and quiet... baby pool just next to adut pool. its east to look after your kid when ur at the pool... They even gave me complimentary parking everytime I am leaving the hotel to some other place. thank u Changi village hotel once again.

The club lounge is small but adequate. Limited range of food and drink but again it was adequate. Wine was average.
Staff were very pleasant and helpful. The free wifi was excellent.

solo,,False,,"I could stay here again if I don't find a cheaper yet better option in the vicinity! So I stayed here twice in a span of 10-12 days. I usually stay in and around Bugis area everytime I visit Singapore as that is quite central. But I had pre-booked this hotel as I was visiting for the Guns'n'Roses concert and the hotel was close to the concert venue. And the second time I stayed for a night when I got back from the Jakarta Jazz Festival a week later, as my return flight was from Singapore and the hotel is close to the airport as well.

I didn't really find any other hotels in the vicinity so I didn't have an option. But the stay was comfortable, except that the corridors and alleys leading to the rooms are looong and quite dark. The rooms are well equipped, well lit, and the bed is comfortable.

I have mixed reviews about the reception. The people at the reception are quite slow and the check-in process could take some time. Also, this bald Chinese guy at the reception is extremely rude. If you asked him something twice he could reply with a loud and rude ""Wait!"". He needs to understand that I'm not standing in a que for free food. But this other girl at the reception was really sweet and she also gave me an extended check-out as my flight was delayed.

The best part about the stay was the 'other' things in the vicinity. The surroundings are quite calm, clean, green, and away from the hustle-bustle. The Changi Village Hawker Centre is just a 2 min walk, and it's one of the best hawker centres for food that you'll find. And there are quite a few local eateries and cozy drinking joints around.

Considering I travel for music, local food, beer, and a good night's sleep...I got it all.

The free Airport Shuttle service is a big PLUS! Though they didn't allow me to carry my Guzheng, a 5.5 foot long Chinese string instrument which I had bought from a local music store, to the airport in the free shuttle bus. Of course, it's their policy and it's also mentioned inside the bus that heavy luggage and surf boards are not allowed, but then the bus was empty and they could have allowed me to carry it as it would have saved me 60 dollars which I paid to the van guy who dropped me to the airport.

Overall, it's not a bad place at all but I gave 3 stars instead of 4 coz there's nothing much to do inside the hotel and I would only visit that side of town for gigs and food. And this place is quite expensive to just spend the night to enjoy the 'other' things in the vicinity.

As a solo traveler if you find anything cheaper in the vicinity, just go for it. I would, too.",2017-02-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Weekend Stay and Play Location is actually good despite accessibilty, because there are lots of activities to do in the vicinity, such as the pools, darts, bowling, karaoke and even tennis at the Civil Servant Club. You can also cycle or chill by the nearby Changi beach or enjoy food at te famous Changi Village hawker centre or the numerous cafes around. There are also Mama shops that sell cheap and a wide range of alcohol.
Hotel wise... decor is basic but good enough... inside cleaniness is sufficient but the outer ide of the windows are quite nasty with dust water stains and algae..Pool on top also needs some cleaning...The breakfast buffet was pretty good, food was quality and there was a wide variety - I couldn't sop eating!",2017-06-01,PreCovid,1
couple,,False,,"Not a very pleasant staycation Booked this staycation with my Fiance. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT with Far East Hospitality. Previously, our stay at Oasia Novena was superb and thought we might give Changi a try.

First, we arrived at 210pm and expected an immediate check in. But was told to wait till 330pm as no King size bed is available. We waited till 3pm and asked Front Office again if we have rooms. And they checked us in. I think I can safely assume that if we hadn't approached them, Front Office will call us at 330pm for the check in?

Second, we wanted to use the rooftop pool and we know that there's a solemnization happening from 5-9pm. We called Front Office to ask if the pool was closed, they said the pool is open. We went there at 530pm and to our amazement, the wedding guest at the reception told us nicely that the pool is closed! And there was this guy who shouted at the people in the pool to get out as the entire place was booked for a private event! There was no signage at the pool stating that it will be closed, nor were there any notice on the hotel's website to inform guests of the private event. When checking in, Front Office also didn't tell us about the pool. It's quite ridiculous on how such miscommunication can happen. Well, what can we do. Both my Fiance and I just laughed to each other and went off for dinner.

And lastly, the wifi speed around the hotel is horrible. We can't even stream a proper youtube video.

Take a stroll along the beach which is about 10 minutes away from the hotel and enjoy the serenity. This is despite having planes landing at the nearby Changi Airport every few minutes. The sound of the plane engine is somehow 'therapeutic' . I checked in to the Junior Suite, which is spacious, clean and quiet (it occupies the corner of the building). There are two sinks and the toilet has plenty of space even with a huge bathtub there. The bed and pillows are comfortable and we enjoyed the night very much, Staff are very attentive and polite. The service culture at the Village Hotel Changi is commendable. When we checked in, we were pleasantly surprise to receive a hand-written greeting card by a Guest Services Assistant, Ms Nabilah Yusman. In most of the hotel I visited, it is not uncommon for the Manager or the Managing    Director to place a type-written letter as a form of welcoming its guest. It is very heart warming to receive a hand-written card with cute drawings from a ground staff. This goes to show how much the management of this hotel trusted its staff to manage its customer. Well done! Although there was a small hiccups when our access to the executive lounge was denied by the card reader, it was resolved quickly when we approached the front desk. The executive lounge is located on the 6th level and provides light refreshment and drinks free of charge. We spent a considerable amount of time there listening to the soothing music and watching the plane approaching the airport. It was a fantastic view. The use of computers and printer at the lounge are complimentary. While the breakfast at the main lobby provides more varieties of food, the food at the lounge taste better. The speed of the free WiFi is fast and stable. This hotel stands out because of its location and the strong service-centric culture of its management team.

Check-in was a breeze. In no time, we we were on our way to our room on the 7th floor. We were pleasantly surprised when we entered the room. The view of the sea from the balcony was breathtaking, much to the delight of the kids! We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt thanks to Ms Sheda & her team for arranging such a nice clean room with simple decorations of towel swans and balloons on the bed. We truly appreciate the nice gesture. Uncle Adam was also very polite and warm as he set up the extra bed for us as well as arrange for the extra towels and pillows for the children, although we heard it was full house at the hotel. He assured us that he would be around if there was anything else we needed.

We also appreciate the fact that the hotel restaurant has been halal-certified by MUIS. We tried out the Ramadhan buffet and to our pleasant surprise, even though the spread was not as much as other hotel buffets, they tasted really delicious! My children especially loved the outdoor bbq of steak, prawn and chicken. We also like the rojak and dessert corners as well as the free flow of delicious bandung drink. We had a hearty meal that evening and at the end of it, were even thinking of coming back for the buffet again another evening before Eid.

We also went for a nice walk in the late afternoon, exploring the Changi coast infront of the hotel. It was relaxing and we got the chance to appreciate the flora, fauna and scenic view of the sea. Back at the hotel, the children could also purchase some fish food to feed the koi fish in the hotel pond.

There are also many food eateries outside the hotel (esp halal ones) so you will definitely be spoilt for choice. Convenience stores (e.g. Cheers) are also available if you need to get items like late-night snacks or drinks.

family,,False,,"Fantastic Staycation! My family and I (comprising 2 adults and 1 child under 12) enjoyed a wonderful 1-day staycation at Village Hotel Changi.

When we arrived at the hotel, the hotel front desk staff were warm, friendly, attentive and responsive to our needs, including providing an immediate upgrade to a junior suite from a deluxe room, besides providing prompt hotel service in allowing us to keep our luggage at the hotel while the room was being prepared and while we explored the vicinity. The junior suite was large and very comfortable, providing all the necessary amenities, if not, comforts, for a memorable stay.

One great thing about this hotel is its convenience to nearby amenities, especially our very own rustic island hideout - Pulau Ubin, literally a short comfortable boat ride away! I didn't realize it earlier, but we could have gotten a free hour of complimentary cycling there had I known about and asked for the tickets to do so. Nonetheless, we had a very enjoyable afternoon there having a nice fresh seafood makan and fresh coconut with mango (& durian, if desired) ice-cream, then cycling and exploring the island. My very urbanized (ie. prefers air-conditioned comforts, computer and handphone games) son in particular, took in all the sights and smells of kampong village life that we hardly see in mainland Singapore, including encountering our very own Ubin orchard, quarry, even a wild boar!

Then, we returned to mainland with a delicious cheap and good local delights dinner at Changi Village Hawker Centre, enjoying some of Singapore's best nasi lemak, orh luak with fresh plump oysters, satay, chicken wings, freshly squeezed sugar cane with (and without, as another family member preferred) lemon juice, soya milk, goreng pisang and other street snacks.

Too stuffed to enjoy more, we returned to the hotel to experience a few hours of the beautiful rooftop infinity pool & jacuzzi with its twinkling lights and great night view & pretty close-up views of aeroplanes flying across the sea! Needless to say, we slept most comfortably that night after watching some TV and enjoying the free wifi.

The next morning, another front desk staff allowed all 3 (instead of original 2 only) of us family members to enjoy the complimentary yummy spread of buffet breakfast!

Then, we enjoyed another great benefit service of the hotel after breakfast, when the hotel staff provided coupons so that we could take a complimentary 1-hour bicycle ride around the Changi Village neighborhood, when we thoroughly enjoyed the windy seafront scenery along Changi beach cycling track, and exploring Changi Village and its quaint shops selling campcraft, etc, further!

We returned to Changi Village Hawker Centre to enjoy another scrumptious cheap and good lunch, as well as to buy food back home, including frog porridge and other local food that we had not tried yet, then returned to the hotel to enjoy a late checkout at 2pm.

Another fantastic benefit was that the hotel front desk staff provided us with complimentary parking & had we wanted, we could have gotten more hotel parking coupons if we had chosen, eg. to drive out to nearby Changi museum and chapel, and come back to the hotel after that.

All in all, if we had more time, we may also have enjoyed the free local shuttle to Changi Airport and back to the hotel to explore the different terminals there.

After an easy checkout and having left the hotel that afternoon, we had a minor shock when my son said he could not find his Kindle. I drove back to the hotel and explained to the front desk, who once again, were extremely helpful, even providing us the key back to our former hotel room which was about to be cleaned, with an attendant to facilitate the search. Indeed, she was most supportive and even initiated the auto-lift of the automatic queen bed so that I could check underneath it. Although I could not find the Kindle in the room, I returned to the ground floor with my son informing that he had thankfully found it in the car.

Thus, my stay at Village Hotel Changi was a very positive experience all-round and I would come back again for the A-grade awesome, attentive and accommodating staff and top-notch service, with great facilities and wonderful amenities, not least a great opportunity to enjoy the 'old Singapore', especially the fantastic neighborhood including Changi Village and Pulau Ubin (& more!).

There are some old colonial buildings in the area, and good hawker food to be had.

The hotel is a good 4 star. Amenities are straight forward and unfussy, but the hotel has two elegant pools, a very nice, small club lounge, and small but well appointed bedrooms. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. Yes, the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a glass wall, but there is a blind one can lower.

The best part of the hotel is the staff who are uniformly excellent - efficient but also warm and friendly.

The swimming pool at the top deck, its where the main attraction of the hotel is to me, its a nice place to swim and relaxing with a view of the wide sea. Do check this out when you guys were there.

The fitness centre, it gaves me a WOW factor which initially i thought that i am going to a place with just some basic standard machines but i was really surprised that they actually can operate as a full gym with free weights and full equipments.

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Excellent Service with attentive and friendly staff. Some might query why I stayed at the Changi Village Hotel during my holiday in Singapore? The answer is a little complicated. My father was posted to Singapore in 1964 and we stayed in the Changi based transit accommodation for a couple of weeks. That is now the Changi civil service club that is across the road from the hotel. I also didn't want the modern 24/7 busy city experience (been there and done that). I wanted a laid back and authentic Singapore break. And Changi Village did not disappoint one bit.

I arrived at 10am (checkin normally at 2pm) but that was no problem and I upgraded to the club grade. Club gives you access to an exclusive lounge with unlimited cold and hot drinks during the day. Breakfast and early evening included cocktails and nibbles which never disappointed. Special mention to Sheda (Club Manager) and her team of people who made sure that you were always looked after. The Terrance area overlooked the sea and the approach into Changi Airport, if you like watching planes queue up for landing, this is an ideal place to waste some time and chill out. By the way, you hardly notice the noise, modern aircraft are ultra quiet.

Rooms are very comfortable, I haven't slept so well in ages. In fact I must find out what make of mattresses they use as I have to buy one for use at home! Attentive and efficient maid service made the stay very comfortable and homely.

Salt Water Cafe - only used their buffet, which was extensive and included a mixture of Asian and European dishes. It appeared to be busy servicing locals, which if you know Singapore, tells you that the food is of good quality.

Changi Village itself is beautiful and unspoiled. Its ultra clean and way off the normal tourist track - if you want an authentic local Singapore experience, it is the last bastion of that way of life. Food is a way of life, no McDonald, KFC, Starbucks ... just totally authentic Asian food of the highest quality. Look, if the locals don't frequent the place, it just isn't any good. And this place was always busy. Loads of choice, Malay, Japanese, Thai, Indian, Indonesian and even Western (but only if you absolutely have too).

Highlights include the Changi Park and the Boardwalk - which is amazing. Take the walk early morning of late afternoon - it gets very hot during the day (as I found out to my cost). Parrots, Turns, Myhna Bird, Eagles Lizards and even Otters can be seen (though I lucked out on the Otters).",2017-05-01,PreCovid,0

We have a Long flight & even join in long ques at the airport, reaching late night (almost 10pm) at the hotel. It was so exhausting for us. Upon approaching into the reception of the hotel a young sharp looking gentle man ( Gio) gave as a warm greetings & a bright smile even we know that he is busy attending to some Chinese guest.
He did not let us wait but attended to us with urgency.
While processing our booking & having a small talk with him, he informed us that our booking does not include breakfast, we were so disappointed only to find out that it was my mistake not to include breakfast. Gio humbly offered us a very reasonable price to upgrade our room into the club executive room which consist with a lot of perks. Including breakfast, city tour, Cycling , Bowling & even late check out & etc...
From $140, he slush the price almost half of it just accommodate our needs & more than what we needed. Room was excellent neat & tidy & with an ocean view, polite & friendly staff at the club lounge,cozy rooftop swimming pool, staff greets you very time you passes them.
Because of this our unplanned short visit in Singapore makes it worth while & became memorable to me & to my Wife.
I salute to the management team of this hotel for having a great friendly staff & a great location.

A shortcoming to highlight:

The staff at the front desk was not very friendly or welcoming. It was kind of shocking to receive such sterile treatment. Also, we booked a room with double bed but was given a twin room. Called the front desk and they swapped our room almost immediately. Small issue but definately a bad start to the trip.

Positives-

We took the excutive room. it was big and spacious. it came with club benefits such as refreshments and cocktail hour. children below 12 are not allowed in the lounge. the lounge is very comfortable and clean. the staff are very friendly unlike the girls at the reception. You get a guranteed late check out at 4pm! :)

the buffet lunch at Saltwater was really good and worth a try! will definately come back for the buffet. The buffet breakfast was good too.

the hotel is very conveniently located and there are lots of food options outside the hotel. the beach is also walking distance. you can also easilly get on a ferry to pulau ubin.

I booked a non-refundable room for three people for April 30th instead of July 15th... I realized this mistake upon reception of an email requesting me to answer asatisfaction survey a few days ago. I am fully aware it is my mistake.
Nevertheless, when I called the management and explained the situation, I was said to have booking.com write the management to simply try and rebook the room for July 15th (the right date of my travel to Singapore), without asking for a new payment, and that it should work that way.
That is what I did and that is what booking.com did.
Unfortunately, I just received the answer from booking.com that the management refused to do so. They are in their full right, and I understand, but what I may assert with conviction is that they are not really customer oriented, to say the least. So of course, I want to warn other customers to be extra careful when booking a non-refundable room in this hotel.
I find it sad they are not able to answer positively such a simple request, above all as I sincerely doubt the hotel was full on the night of April 30th, meaning it certainly wouldn't have cost anything to do this rebooking.

Such a gem she is.

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Good for a stay near the airport or in Changi village I stayed here for one night in March 2017. I was flying back into Singapore after a few nights in Malaysia, and had an early flight out the morning after so a stay near the airport was called-for.

I enjoyed my stay. I thought the architecture of the main hotel itself - the lobby and atrium, etc - was interesting and dramatic. The room itself was slightly disappointing as I couldn't get it quite cool enough for my tastes. (It wasn't hot, just not not as cool as I like it.) That said, the room had everything I needed, and it all worked. It seems clean, too.

While I was there I walked around Changi village in the afternoon and also out to Changi Point and along Changi Boardwalk, and these are all within walking distance of the hotel. (Although it was a hot walk.)

I decided to stay in the hotel for dinner and ate at their Italian restaurant on the 8th floor. Very grand, but i was the only diner! I ate out on the terrace so the location was superb and I had a good meal at a not-too-unreasonable price, given the location, etc. I was able to watch the planes coming into Changi airport a couple of miles away - i swear that sometimes I was looking *down* on them....

The following morning I had to get a very early shuttle (complimentary) back to the airport which was before the restaurant opened for breakfast, so I was given a 'breakfast box' instead. This was a couple of pastries, an apple, and a bottle of juice, and was actually just what I wanted at that unearthly hour of the morning. The shuttle ran on time, and it was obvious that they knew what they were doing - passengers and bags were loaded in the logical order for the terminals required, i.e. passengers, etc, for first terminal were last into the shuttle.

This hotel was good for what I was doing - a stopover near the airport. It's a long way from the city, however, and might not be very suitable for those holidaying in Singapore itself.",2017-03-01,PreCovid,0

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Much better than expected and a fine location Flying in from Bangkok we chose this hotel partly because of the location close to the airport and the seaside and partly because we had stayed several times in hotels downtown Singapore before.

We were a bit surprised when our taxiride lasted almost 20 minutes even if the hotel is close to the airport.
It was due to the road goes all around the airport area first,- but that did not matter much for us anyway.

The hotel location is very good for overnight stays but also for longer as the area is very interesting with seaside walks, a peninsula park with beaches and more.

We had booked a Superior room without breakfast but on arrival we upgraded to Executive Club and a large room on the same floor (6th).
This was well worth the extra money and included a late check-out.

The room and bathroom were very clean and very large.
We had windows with seaside view but no balcony - which did not matter as the Club was 15 yards away with indoor and outdoor seatings.

The hotel had several amenities,- many restaurants, one swimmingpool downstairs, one swimmingpool and a restaurant on the rooftop, the executive club & more.

We enjoyed the executive club near by our room and the elevators.
Breakfast, evening light meal, drinks, wine, coffe/tea and more was included.
We also met other pleasant and interesting guests there.

The hotel is very convenient for SAA, just a 5 minute walk crossing only one not-too-busy major road. Lots of nearby dining from very cheap to moderately high-end dining.

Upon arrival I was a little surprised at the budget-hotel style minimalist checkin with one staff member and a line of a half dozen people. The checkin process itself was fine. My room, 664, was not particularly spacious but fine overall.
- Wireless internet reception was very poor on that (back) side of the hotel.
- Near my room was a small paved section inset in the generally carpeted floor. Staff trolleys made horrendous loud noise as they transited this section. I was twice woken at precisely 06:00 by this roaring rumble.
- The aircon was adequate, but slow to make an appreciable impact on the hot and steamy everything ... but this is Singapore.
- The club lounge, and breakfast, was fine and had a balcony (unfortunately infested with smokers from time to time). It became a little cozy at times and several solo business travelers expressed some discontent at the little low tables. There were also a couple taller tables which became coveted claims amongst us.
- The Japanese restaurant in-hotel was very ordinary. The room service meal I had was quite good. The breakfast buffet, in the small club lounge, was a little sparse but adequate ... especially when people realised they could order actual eggs to avoid the congealed egg-like foodstuff. The asian-cuisine breakfast choices were good.

Okay, so it considers itself an airport hotel because of its proximity to Changi airport, although that is still a 20-minute shuttle ride away.
I have nothing to complain concerning the facilities and amenities available to guests. There are two pools, one at the rooftop and the other by the cafe.
For those who do not intend to venture downtown, the tourist attractions nearby include Changi prison chapel and memorial (featured in some war movies), rustic Pulau Ubin and Changi coastal boardwalk.
As this is Singapore, there is no shortage of good food from restaurants and hawker centres in the vicinity, either within walking distance or just a short car ride away.
The nearest shopping malls are accessible by bus, or just take the free shuttle to the airport itself for duty-free bargains.
The housekeeping staff are really on their toes; here's a special shout-out to Ngeh Mei and Mani for the great job they did.
However, the kettle in my room does not switch off automatically, and may not be good for those who are used to the ones that do.
Here are just two other suggestions for improvements:
1) There is a launderette on my floor, and i see only women's magazines placed there for users to read. I say men do laundry too, and even if they don't, some women may even like to read men's magazines and learn a thing or two from them.
2) The free airport shuttle is a great service with friendly drivers but i noticed some of the armrests have worn out, leaving the rusty metal under the covering exposed which can be a hazard. Can those armrests that have worn out be replaced?",2017-03-01,PreCovid,1

We just missed the shuttle when we landed, you have to go to 'Ground Transport desk', and as we had waited 45min for immigration, rather than wait an hour we decided to take a taxi, $15. The room stank sort of musty like someone had been smoking. I requested room freshener as we were going out for dinner and it was a bit better. To their credit they did ring and ask if it was OK and when I requested more they sent someone within a few minutes. There was also hairs all over the loo seat - not nice.

We almost lost our coolness bec the person who made the mistake insisted that we never reserved the shuttle when in fact he was the one who checked us in for one night and we specifically told him we were flying the next day.

Seats were insufficient too, for the number of people who were up at the pool. However, it's no fault of the hotel' as the space was narrow space. There is another pool on level one, just outside Saltwater cafe. Guests can swim there, if you don't mind restaurant patrons watching you swim while they ate.
Just across the road is a ferry terminal where you can hop onto a ferry for a short ride to Pulau Ubin. It's a rustic island that brings visitors back to the 1950s, with a quaint little village. Bicycles can easily be hired for a ride round the island. Bring along mosquito repellent as we were bombarded by swarms of them, due to the wet season.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Excelent service I found this hotel through agoda.com and view the review from trip advisor as we never been stayed in Changi before.
The hotel seems comfort with bathtub in every type of room (I always prefer room with bathtub if it posible) so this is my number one choice.

So before I madea reservation, I sent an email to the staff to make sure that I will get what we want.
The staff very helpful, they reply me at once and answer with detail whatever I asked. Until the day we must arrived but due to delay of our plane, we arrived very late from the schedule so at the mean time I keep inform them and they patiencely make sure that I got the room that I asked for. And by the time we have arrived, the check-in procedure was quick and easy.

The hotel itself is very nice and sophisticated. They have grab machine, instan chef cooked food machine and drink machine at the lobby (we will not get hungry even we booked the hotel without breakfast).

The room:
For superior type, I found it Spacious and clean, nice tile, has sofa and big enough window with street view. Working desk also available. They have in room smartphone.
Big comfy bed and pillow, had a great nite sleep.
Inside the wardrobe they provide a safety box, iron and ironing board.

Bathroom:
Has no toilet hose! Be warn to prepare a bottle or glass for clean up (you know what I mean)
Small bathroom but suit for medium bathtub, and rain shower on top which is a nice touch.

Surrounding:
They have wine cafe, beside the hotel.
25 hours eating place just a few walk from hotel.
Small market for goodies and 24 hours mini market just a cross the hotel.
Peaceful neighbourhood, but noisy sound of plane as this place near Changi airport.

They have shuttle bus to Changi Airport also to Orchard and many other by the schedule. It's about 15 minutes to changi airport and 30-35 minutes to orchard area.

The rooftop pool beautiful but not enough seating.i thought there was no poolside service until an hour later I noticed a small sign on a wall. The breakfast however was one of the worst I've ever had in a hotel of this standard. Under ripe fresh fruit, but they only had three fruits anyway. A lovely coffee machine but in the mugs supplied you needed to press it three times to fill your cup. Over two minutes to get a coffee isn't good. Most of the food was for Asian style breakfast and what was left was overlooked and not very pleasant at all. I would stay here again but I would eat elsewhere.

They even had a food vending machine with various menus! That's truly remarkable.

Not that there were any shortage of food choices. Just a stone throw's away, there are many many local restaurants serving local delicacies and many unique cosy bars and cafes!

Room is not exceptionally great, but it was comfy. We didn't quite like it as it was not carpeted, but totally understandable, as the location is near to Changi Beach/Pulau Ubin. It wouldn't make sense to make the rooms carpeted anyway.

Basic toiletries are provided. Many channels available for viewing. They had a channel which showcase on what to do in Singapore. And the hotel even provided a mobile phone with UNLIMITED data and international & local calls. HOW AMAZING IS THAT?! Be careful not to lose or damage it though, as there will be charges incurred.

All staff (from security, to front office to technician) were exceptional! They paid very close attention to detail. One example was when we had feedbacked to the front office that the aircon in our room wasn't cold enough, and the technician sent to our room checked the unit thoroughly before leaving the room and made sure that we were satisfied with temperature of the room.

The bed was surprisingly big enough to accomodate me, my child (2 yo) & husband.

The hotel provides shuttle service from Changi Village Hotel to Changi Airport, Changi Business Park, Far East Plaza (Orchard Road) & Village Hotel Bugis (Bugis). You can start your sightseeing there.

We had done no research as it was recommended by our travel agent.
It is away from the immediate hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to both the city centre and airport by taxi to make it a convenient location.

It is in the Changi district which has more of a village feel. ( Changi Museum a must see for those interested in history and social science, but do take your tissues ). There are plenty of restaurants next door to the hotel and a 5 minute walk across the road led us to a lovely clean park, some shops and the beach. Our daughter enjoyed playing on the outdoor climbing equipment and paddling in the ocean.

Our room was small but adequate for a few nights. The bathroom area was a reasonable size and had a nice bathtub.

The breakfast buffet was standard.

The highlight was the fantastic outdoor pools. One was located near the buffet and had a stylish pool window side ( like a fish bowl effect ). The other was located on the roof. We really enjoyed unwinding at the end of a hot day's sightseeing with a swim in this infinity type pool.

Service from the staff at front of house was very ordinary most of the time but we found one of the house maids ( Maria ) to be very informative and friendly. She gave us lots of tips about what we could see and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. You need to be aware that even though free airport shuttle buses go every hour or so, you still need to book your seat on them.

Isolated away from the bustling city in the East of Singapore and just a 5 minutes walk away from Changi Beach. This venue is great escape during the weekends. There are many amenities near by such as bowling allies, located at Civil Service Club, Pulau Ubin which is a 15 min ferry ride away, supper spots such as RIA 89.7 as well as other great food places such as Changi Village Food Centre, one will be spoilt for activities as well as food choices.

PS if you're still into the pokemon craze it's definitely lots of fun to go poke-hunting in groups there. People in Singapore here are definitely very active.

The strategic location of the hotel was the perfect venue to just chill or head out for any outdoor activities. Will deffinitely be coming back soon.

So we waited patiently but by 4.15pm we were still not updated and finally we just cut the queue and went straight to the counter and they told us that the room was still not ready and that we had to wait. Finally managed to check-in at 4.30pm. It was the long new years weekend and it seems they were unable to handle the high volume. The counter staff looked stressed out and there were long snaking queues with plenty of guests. Still, I think they could have just updated us rather than us having to wait around and having to bug them before we got a proper response.

A nice touch was the plants growing near the pool which other hotels rarely have. I suspect most comments of a dirty pool will be pertaining to the foliage dropping into the pool which is something important to bear in mind. I was thankful that it was just a few flowers and leaves I saw instead of hair or other muck I was imagining after reading poor comments on the pool cleanliness. The pool is also cleaned frequently so this is rarely a problem.

The included buffet breakfast was also tasty with a wide selection of Asian, western and other typical breakfast fare. Great value for money and it was loads of fun having whatever we could think of for breakfast each day. One point to note is that though not halal, the restaurant (saltwater cafe) doesn't serve pork which is a nice touch for Muslim guests.

As stated the booking did not state king Or Twin bedding ( which I completely understand would be subject to availability) . On accepting the twin room as I was too tired to wait I realised I on getting to the room that it was in a superior twin.

family,,False,,"Horrible staycation experience over Christmas weekend Am writing this review in the hotel room right now. Decided to give this hotel a chance for my twice-yearly staycation and booked a 3D2N stay via the Far East Hospitality website, which advertised prominently that free breakfast would be provided for customers who booked through that portal. During check-in, the front desk refuse to honour the advertisement, stating that the booking voucher did not include breakfast. It was only after I expressed severe unhappiness that the hotel provided me with the breakfast vouchers, but they had to emphasise that it was based on goodwill by the hotel and I am not entitled to breakfast in the first place.

Things got worse when I stepped into the room. First, the electric kettle was rusty inside and I had to request for a new one. Next, i discovered one of the legs for the bed was missing, and I had to call house-keeping a second time to fix it. When I wanted to use the safe, it could not work because there was insufficient battery, I decide that I should not bother house-keeping a third time.

The hotel carpark was full when i first arrived due to a wedding function in the afternoon. As of now, the carpark is still full probably due to a birthday party held in the late evening. My car is still parked opposite the hotel in Civil Service Club and incurring additional parking charges. While this is no fault of the hotel, perhaps more could be done in terms of carpark management.

I am keeping my finger crossed that Christmas Day and Boxing Day would be a lot more smooth-sailing than the Eve, which was plagued by bad weather as well (no fault of the hotel).

On reliability, it has displayed it by ensuring that my room was decorated with flower petals as per discussed via email. As a consumer, I have faced many companies which promised that everything could be done, however, eventually it could not be done due to a lack of horizontal communications. Thank you guys, we love the decorations!

On assurance, I would like to comment Loyee for assisting us in the confirmation of the city tour. I wanted to attend the city tour before checking in on Tuesday. However, I did not receive any booking confirmation on Monday night, hence I called the hotline to check on the status. Loyee exemplified reassurance by running through the correspondence and upon realizing it was a technical failure, she immediately sends me the confirmation email. Thank you very much for your help!

On tangibles, I would say it was superb amenities for a leisure / boutique hotel. I expected much lesser amenities and facilities for the price that I am paying for. Thank you for making my stay an amazing one. I would like to highlight the pool on Lvl 8, it has a beautiful sea view, making it feel so comforting as a city dweller coming to Village Hotel to unwind.

On empathy, every customer-contact employee was friendly, they would always greet me with a wide smile, making me feel at ease.

On responsiveness, when I asked for a late checkout, (disclaimer: it does not work everytime guys, it really depends) the frontline staff allowed me to have a late checkout as it was a special day for my girlfriend and I.

Overall, it was an amazing experience. However, there are two points which fall short of an amazing experience. Firstly, the F&B staff lacks a service-oriented mindset, they were quite unfriendly and were very inflexible when I asked for a change in seating.

We took a limo taxi from the airport cost 25 SGD and took just under 20 mins as we were tired and didn't want to wait for the free shuttle.
Check in was quick and we were offered a special rate to upgrade to the club room access. Good value (Complimentary alcohol 6-8pm)
The pool on the top floor was lovely but rammed - masses of children. There is another pool on the ground floor and a more peaceful area around the fish pond on floor 6.
Rooms were basic but reasonably comfy.

Lobby staff efficient and always accessible; room was clean and comfortable.

Worth paying to include breakfast as it was very impressive. Two pools and ok gym.

Location is a ways from airport by cab or shuttle (20mins minimum) but you can walk to good local restaurants, rent bikes, walk along pathways, ferry to island, beach activities like kayaking, swimming etc. The other hotels near airport seemed to be in a boring business district so we preferred this one. The cab driver said there is one other hotel near Village Changi which is newer but likely more expensive.

If airport shuttle not around the cab to hotel was S$16; heading to city centre it was S$22. Don't miss Garden By The Bay and areas nearby if heading into centre of town. We had a full day layover so spent day walking in and around this area. Lots to do here.

couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Staycation  Booked a junior suite at village hotel changi from Saturday to sun. Even though there was a queue at the checkin, it was still relatively fast. Checkin took about 10mins.

Pros:
First impression of the room was spacious and clean. Bed was comfortable. Toilet comes with separate rain shower and bath tub. Enjoyed the rain shower. The swimming pool had a separate jacuzzi pool

Cons:
Air conditioning was a bit weak to our liking. The drain of the bath tub is faulty. Hence had a hard time filling up the bath tub. Water kept getting drained as the tub was filing up. The roller blind which provides cover between the room and toilet is faulty. I had to manually pull the blind down everytime I needed to use the toilet.

- great location for a staycation. Far enough to feel like you're away from the city, without the hassles of overseas traveling. Many food within close walking distance.
- reasonable prices, room size is good for a hotel in Singapore
- staff are generally friendly and courteous
- pool on level 8 had lovely views and had spaces for kids
- complimentary wifi works well, both in room and public places

Cons
- despite the refurbishment, certain parts of hotel still looks tired and dated
- part of the lock on the room door has been ripped out. However lock on handle was still working
- very poor sound-proofing. I was woken up on the first night at about 3am by the people next door who seemed to have just checked in. Loud talking, action movie on tv and banging doors. At about 4am I called reception and shortly after I heard the next door's phone ringing. They turned off the tv but continued chit chatting, though slightly softer. Then the shower in my toilet started dripping for no reason. Then the neighbors decided we need some Indian music. At about 5, they went to sleep. And their alarm woke me up at 6. Yes, I could hear the alarm in the other room. The next morning, another group checked in (or returned to their room) at about 4am in the morning. So I came back from a staycation, more exhausted and nowhere near recharged. Although to be fair, I'm myself a very light sleeper. My child slept slightly better.

couple,,False,,"Wonderful repeat stay In a very good way, nothing has changed since last year. Rooms were clean, we took the Deluxe room again. Initially we were given a room facing the service lobby doors and me being a sound-sensitive sleeper, found it agonising. We sought a room change and the receptionist on duty readily made it happen. (Please advise me if providing the name of the staff will be definitively beneficial).

Later on, I realised that there is no avoiding the thuds and pipe knocks from the auto-switching mechanism of the shower-head/rain-shower of neighbouring rooms. The main room door can also benefit from noise-dampening and door-frame cushioning. Again, this is from a guy who needs absolute quiet during sleep, so don't worry if you sleep like a log in all conditions.

Housekeeping was impeccable, based on our usage of both rooms. The cleanliness of the bathroom is exemplary. However, please provide more frictional surfaces other than just a mould-colonised polymer mat (underside). The second room's bathtub also lacked the tiny ridged barrier that prevents water from flooding the ground. (We used the shower curtain correctly; yes, inside the bathtub). I'm happy to provide the room number via email.

family,5.0,True,Positive,"Surprising my aunt with Hotel accomodation treats We have a wonderful experience in Changi Village Hotel (Far East) where we have our 3-day staycation to surprise our aunt from Australia who is coming over to Singapore before going to Manila.  We chose this hotel because of its proximity from the airport and the place is so peaceful and relaxing.  You have a great view of the sea which you don‚Äôt usually see in the city.   Inside, as always you are greeted by very warm staffs.  I personally want to thank Jayvy from front desk who made all the reservation and requests possible and to Muz for helping us carry our things up.  Our room is located on the 6th floor.  When we are ushered in to our room, we were so amazed on how clean it was and spacious.  But the most eye-catching treat is the decoration they made in the room.  It was so artistic and my aunt loves it very much. (see photo).  For that I want to give my utmost appreciation to the Housekeeping, Shally, Mani and Remy for decorating the room and making our beds.  There is also a koi fish pond on the 6th floor where the kids enjoyed feeding the fishes.  You can buy the fish feed for only $2 and you can also enjoy feeding those lovely koi fishes.  Aside from the kids, I saw my aunt enjoying as well.   During our stay, we chose the club room so we can have access the Club Lounge where there are free drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and tasty snacks.  My aunt personally loves the cheeses and the red wine.  We are welcomed by Fazlon and Kai.  They are so friendly and accommodating.  I would like to thank them for their great service and for making ourselves comfortable with the place.  I would recommend anyone to choose the club room so they can visit the club lounge and immerse yourself with free drinks and snacks.  It‚Äôs all worth it.Dinner time, we treat our aunt with a luscious buffet just near the lobby of the hotel.  The Salt Water restaurant offers a lot of variety of choices from international cuisine.  My aunt enjoys her sushi and sashimi and she also love the local specialties, especially the stewed mutton.  I can see that she is really enjoying the food, and she keeps coming back for more.  I asked one of the staff if they can prepare something for my aunt, so happen that she recently celebrated her birthday.  The staff gave my aunt a piece of cake with lighted candle decorated with berries and chocolate dressing.  My aunt was surprised to see the cake.  We and staff all greeted her.  So I would like to thank Beth, Maria and Wan Ching for arranging this and for the warm accommodation.  My aunt is truly overjoyed.   By the way, the hotel has its own shuttle service going to the airport.  So when the time when my aunt has to leave to catch her early flight, we took the shuttle service going to the airport.  It is so convenient and accessible.  Even in our 3 days‚Äô staycation, we were able to make memories with our aunt.  Thank you Changi Village Hotel.

Comfy room, fluffy pillows, firm mattress (very much Asian style in my experience). Good gym. Impressive buffet breakfast- cheaper if you pay at check in ($20 vs $26).
Quiet area compared to downtown Singapore, with lots of locals eating out at the hawkers market about 50m before the hotel. A fantastic slice of Singapore life to immerse yourself in briefly. Very safe. Changi doesn't appear as clean as other parts of Singapore. But it's still very clean compared to other cities.
The hawkers markets are open from 11am-4am and serve fresh food. So no matter what time you arrive you're pretty likely to get a good meal. 7/11 is also opposite the hawkers market. Very convenient location.
We took the free hotel shuttle back to the airport. But we just missed the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. Taxi cost is approx $20.

In fact, the mould that long adorned the bathroom is gone.  But with the hotel's shuttle bus running only every 90 minutes, transport to and from Changi Airport is very difficult, requiring very long waits.  So if you take a taxi, as I did, the cost is S$27 at night.  If you take a taxi to and from the hotel, you've added more than  $50 to the cost of the room, and that makes it about the same price as the Crowne Plaza, which is attached by walkway to the airport.  And the Crowne Plaza is a superior hotel, although to benefit of the Village Hotel, there are food courts in easy walking distance.

couple,,False,,"2 nights at Changi Village after Marine Bay Sands After 2 nights at the luxury and mayhem that is Marine Bay Sands, Changi Village was a peaceful revelation. It is hard to believe you are only 20kms out of Singapore CBD. The whole village feels like a Malay township rather than a suburb of SIngapore.

Tje hotel is generally very good. We had a Club Room on Level 6 and whilst the rooms are not huge, we didn't spend a lot of time in our room. The quilt is not too thick to make sleeping hot and the shower has great pressure. We had a minor incident with the toilet backing up but this was quickly resolved bu housekeeping.

Taking the Club Room option is well worth it as it covers breakfast as well as all-say refreshments and liquor and canapes from 6pm to 8pm. Given the price of alcohol in SG, this is a huge benefit.

As well as the hotel, there are plenty of dining options nearby in Changi Village from good quality but very cheap hawker markets through to restaurants. The L'Etoile cafe just a few doors from the hotel is excellent value with great service and tasty western food.

The hotel has a great rooftop pool with views over the Johor channel. It is great for planespooters too with excellent views of planes shortly before landing or shortly after takeoff. My only complaint is that the hotel advertises the rooftop pool as aan adult oasis whilst he ground floor Creek pool is more tailored for families. Unfortunately, this is not enforced so the rooftop pool can be quite noisy with kids squealing etc.

However, you can see wear and tear of the furniture and walls. The air conditioning is not as strong in the beginning but kind got going closer to the evening, there seems to be a little musky sense during the day.

There is a pool area on the top floor of the hotel and the view off it is really nice and relaxing. you can actually see planes landing on Changi RWY 02 direction which is nice. The gym on the 5th floor is pretty well equipped as well with a steam room in the toilet area.",2016-10-01,PreCovid,1

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Staycation 2D1N Solo Experience The front desk staff is professional. I expected a lower service since I am a local. However I was treated just the same as other overseas travellers. Much to my surprise, I was upgraded to a bigger room. A helpful staff just step forward to assist when my room card was giving problem to access to the guest room in the lift.

Staff at the Saltwater Cafe will direct you to a table and watch out for you that your table is not taken while you get your buffet breakfast. You need not worry that you will return with no seat. This is very helpful for solo traveller. I believed that despite being directed to a certain table, you could request to choose your desire place if the restaurant is not in full capacity.

Checkout was a breeze, since I just need to dial the operator to confirm my checkout and leave the room access cards in the room. I need not queue at the front desk to checkout. However I am not sure is this service applies to local only.

Room was spacious with the basic amenities. As to no mercy with time, any place will have some wear and tear. If you do not expect a newly furnished place, it is generally clean, comfortable and well-maintained. The new addition is the handy smartphone for use which should be much welcome by overseas travellers.

If you are in for a taste of local experience and away from the usual shopping city area, then this hotel may be the choice. There is a big Hawker Centre nearby with much varieties. If you are not use to local food, there are many mid-range restaurants within walking distance which are much cheaper than hotel food. A number of provision shops and 24-hours convenient shops around the place. If you are game for a nice tag-away place for food, just further down Netheravon Road (left side of the road in-front of hotel), there are a few hidden nice restaurants (e.g. Costal Settlement, Jubilee etc).

If you have a bit of time, you may want to take a walk at 2.2km Changi Broadwalk, Changi Beach Park or hop on the boat to Pulau Ubin. All these activities are just walking distance from the hotel.

When I arrived at the airport I was informed it runs every 90 minutes, which wasn't fitting into my arrival. I was told this hotel was ten minutes from airport.  Taxi driver said it was 15 minutes, it took 20 minutes with no traffic.  However on the early morning return to airport taxi went a different way and it did take 10 minutes but then although the meter showed $10.43 he insisted I pay $20 after arguing with him I eventually paid $15 so I could get my luggage out of the boot.   This being no fault of the hotel.The room I paid for included breakfast but as I had to leave at 6am I found out breakfast is not served until 6:30am!  I had booked a superior room as it was only for one night and was told it had single beds when I requested if they had a double bed was given an ""upgrade"" room, which I regretted.  It was the furtherest room from the lift so it was a real battle for me to get my own luggage to the room.The room itself was clean and comfort with a shower over the bath.  What I didn't like was it had wooden floors and would be more appealing with carpet and with a bit of decoration in the room.I checked out the buffet in the dining room but nothing appealed to me for the price and I found a terrific restaurant down the road for almost half the cost.  There are a large amount of ""hawker"" street food stalls close by, also a few other restaurants, a bakery, limited little supermarket type store.There is a ""beach"" nearby and a bike path where you can hire bikes to ride along the foreshore.  If you are looking for an isolated hotel this is for you but if you are looking to see Singapore stay in the city which is only a 20 minute drive by taxi as well.  More on the shuttle service, it leaves every 90 minutes with the first run starting at 5am (see photo ) and the first leaving the airport terminal 1 at 5:50am, terminal 2 at 6:00am and terminal 3 at 6:10am.

Check in was quick and fuss free and when we got to the room, we were glad to find it clean and pretty cozy. We were on the 7th floor so we loved the view of the sea. The bed was VERY comfortable!!! Overall i liked it very much. My only issue was the staff. We went for breakfast and the host at Salt Water was pleasant and smiled, showed us to the table. It wasn't very busy which was great. But i noticed the 2 guys on the floor never once greated the guests or had any interaction with them at all. Not once did they even crack a smile. Worse, the indian lady at the egg station was oblivious to the fact i was standing there to place an order and she too looked like she was having a really bad day. So our experience at the coffee house was not the best but overall we liked the hotel and will be back for sure.",2016-10-01,PreCovid,0
family,,False,,"Excellent location for catching Pokemons We booked 3 rooms (1 Deluxe and 2 Superiors) in Oct 2016. Our requests for interconnecting rooms and the other room to be on the same floor was honoured. The hotel staff had also kindly given us free upgrades to Deluxe rooms for the 2 Superior rooms that we booked. Knowing that we are there for the weekend to play PokemonGo, one of the rooms they gave us faces the main road which is close to 4 Pokestops. This is Room #323. The other rooms we had were #329 & #330 (interconnecting). According to the hotel, there are no interconnecting rooms that faces the main road where the Pokestops are. Nevertheless we are still able to play the game in the room though not as convenient as from Room #323. We noticed that if you are here to play PokemonGo, you should try to book room 307 to 310. These rooms faces the main road (n probably the sea) and close to the lift lobby. From these rooms you should be able to get all 4 Pokestops. Carpark is free ‚Äì 1 carpark lot per room (do ask for it when you make booking). Hotel interior is clean and nice. Staff are approachable and helpful.

friends,,False,,"Too noisy for a hotel..Disruption in sleep!! Had a good impression of the hotel in my previous stays and hence decided to do a 1-day staycation yesterday with a group of 8 (total 4 rooms booked).

Unfortunately it is not a very pleasant stay at all for me and my hubby!

Firstly, the service staff at Vue was not really helpful as he seemed reluctant to answer our questions about the different drinks, and took extremely long to prepare our order (even though there were not many customers).

What was most terrible was the disruption in sleep! Around 2 plus AM, the neighboring room was having a party with loud laughing and talking which woke the two of us up. Gave a call to the reception to report and was told that they will get Security to check. More than an hour later at 3.45am, the noisy situation still persisted and it was almost impossible to go back to sleep.

We gave the reception another call and was told that Security has informed them to lower down their volume. It was really frustrating as we could hear many different voices in the room. Would have thought that only 2 pax are allowed in the hotel room and if Security has visited them, wouldn't they have realised that there were more than 2 there? We told the front desk and got a response that they only see 2 guests registered for the noisy room.. (hmm, wondering what would they have expected me to do with this information???)

For a one night stay to rest and relax, it was disappointing that the management did not manage the noise problem well. Shouldn't there be guidance on how noise in the wee hours that disrupt other guests should be handled? It diminishes my impression of this as a hotel and more like a chalet?

I would have thought that my first call to the front desk would resolve things but it was not until my second call to the front desk to ""push for real action"" before the noise subside...

It was supposedly a relaxing event but both my hubby and I came back home even more tired than before..

It will take me a long while...before I will come back to this hotel for another staycation because we are really disappointed! :(",2016-10-01,PreCovid,1

family,,False,,"Wonderful stay that exceeded expectations:) So I wanted a change in location for my annual mother - daughter staycation (instead of having it again in Sentosa as with previous years), and I am so glad we did! I booked the room (3D/2N) with average expectation as the rate S$ offered via Agoda was low; plus I did read a few reviews that weren't too positive.

We arrived slightly before 2pm and was greeted by Shaik at the check in counter. He was warm, helpful, & checked us in immediately. We were upgraded to a sea view facing deluxe room so that made our day! The room was spacious, neat & clean. Had ALL of the essentials and more: toiletries, coffee/tea, bottled water, wifi, safe, mini fridge, slippers, iron/ironing board, hair dryer, etc - you name it. The bath tub was clean, had a rain shower, and the water pressure was strong & perfect!

We also took on the Club add-on at only $50 per night that included (for two): breakfast, cocktail and tapas (happy hour) from 6-8pm, full day free flow of beverages at the club lounge, and late check out at 4pm. At the club lounge, Sheda and her team pampered us with great service & friendly conversations!

The location of this hotel couldn't have been better! It's walking distance from hawker centre, cafes, eateries that served the best local favourites to other foreign cuisines. In the 3 days, besides enjoying the hotel stay & delicious food, we took nature walks, went Bowling, Cycling,... We skipped Ubin this round...

family,,False,,A great short staycation My house in Tampines was under renovation and so we need a short stay for the weekend together as a family.  We stayed in this hotel for 2 nites and we had requested for a deluxe room but were nicely upgraded to a Club House room for the nite with full benefits.  Room was just nice but wish it was bigger and air con was cold but still tolerable. the bed was so comfortable and the room was sound-proof.. good for light sleepers like me. Toilet was clean and we had the luxury of using thier Handy Phone for free on internet and calls and could be brought out of the hotel too. Food in the hotel was not much of an option as the hotel wasnt halal friendly except for a food dispenser machine located at the lobby but who wants to eat microwave food?  We however had many halal food options outside as this is Changi village and so Halal dining is not a problem.  Changi beach was jus a walk awayThe only think we dislike is the massive Pokemon Crowd right outside the hotel and some were convening in the hotel lobby while playing the game.

couple,,False,,"Serviceable Hotel with Indifferent Frontdesk The hotel gave me the vibes of a business hotel or for people needing a one or two nights stay in transit to somewhere else. Definitely not a hotel to stay long term and unwind. A few things the hotel can improve on - the front desk folks at check in were indifferent, acted like cashiers at a super market, any inquiries was met with suppressed undertone of having to do additional work. Once we settled in the room, calls to front desk went unanswered - and when we made it down to the front desk in person, it was not busy at all. Once we came back in a taxi, the valet couldn't wait to open the doors to unload us even though he can clearly see we were making payment to the taxi. Once we came out, saw why - it was a westerner. Irritating. The pool and the surrounding area looks great. But, the only way to get to it is through a sit down restaurant. Problematic - you don't want to go through a roomful of diners in your poolside clothes, once you are at the pool, everyone at the restaurant can see you. Not conducive to sun bathing or unwinding. The area is a bit out of the way - no immediate access to public transport. On the plus side, there are two hawker centers right next to the hotel and across the street. The size, layout and decor of the room is acceptable. The gym is well equipped with a hot steam room (though a bit smelly and you have to start it to use it which means a bit of wait time). I would have given the place a 3 stars but the staff weighs it down.",2016-10-01,PreCovid,0

solo,,False,,"Nice Hotel but shuttle not too functional. I was told at the time of booking in a message from the travel agent just call hotel from the luggage area and they will come and pick you up. I found that the shuttle from the airport to hotel only runs each 90 minutes and is hard to identify from all the other shuttles. After later seeing the shuttle I think it arrived at the pick up location and departed with out the driver getting out to look for customers. In any case just take the taxi to the hotel from the airport; the cost was SD$17 and SD$27 for the 2 times I took it. The shuttle from the hotel to the airport is much better. If you wish to try the shuttle from the airport call the hotel prior to going and ask them to email you the shuttle schedule and times, with pickup location and instructions noted on the airport map they have.  Also the airport has a travel assistance desk which was very helpful. If you have not been to the airport in Singapore it is incredible, but gigantic, and the taxi appears to be the easiest way to get out quickly.  There are 3 huge terminals so you need the map to know where the pickup location is if you try the shuttle.    The hotel was great, the location is good there is a food court very close by and the hawker center just across the street and a park also across the street.  I found the rooms to very nice and bed comfortable. The staff at the hotel were very good and check in was very efficient, also i needed new batteries in the in room safe and the person came to replace the batteries within 10 minutes, and test the safe for normal operation.    I used the pool on the roof which was outstanding, I was there at night, but in the heat of there day I bet it is even more refreshing and the view is great.     They have assorted dining at the hotel which also looked interesting, and a food vending machine in the lobby.    Also not too far from the hotel they have a transit center of some type.    So for a cost effective stay near the airport I would recommend this hotel, and I hope to use it again.    For anyone going to Singapore for vacation I would suggest to investigate all the rail, bus and other transportation options before going as they have assorted rail and multi use passes, some which can be purchased in Singapore and some which must be purchased in advance.

- Poor communication amongst staff. Usually need to follow up more than once on requests which seems not to be passed on properly.

- Lobby was overcrowded with Pokemon players and could not get even a place to sit while waiting for front desk or taxi. There is a Pokemon thingie going on opposite the hotel and the place is crowded especially at night and weekends.

- Can see that they have done some touch up to the rooms but it's really more patchwork than a rehaul.

- Free Parking

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Very good overall - some issues to be addressed THE GOOD:

Nice, pleasant staff.

The room was very clean, spacious and bright. I had no problems with mould as some of the other reviews mentioned. The bed was very comfortable.

I could see planes arriving over the sea, but couldn‚Äôt hear them. I think the glass was sound-proof. Couldn‚Äôt hear the road or any other noise for that matter, and I am a very, very light sleeper. I had two solid nights sleep here.

Very affordable and good food nearby, open at all hours. I don‚Äôt see the point of eating at the hotel. I didn‚Äôt miss out by not paying for the hotel buffet breakfast, which was too much food for me anyway ‚Äì I simply went outside and had a noodle soup for $5.

If you don‚Äôt want to leave the hotel to eat, they had a vending machine in the lobby that served hot food at reasonable prices ‚Äì I thought this was a good idea.

The cheap mobile phone provided in the room for local calls and internet was very useful. Great for when you don‚Äôt have access to internet outside of wifi areas.

There was a kettle and mugs in the room. Thought it would be nice if they provided a bowl, plate, spoon and fork too. I called room service and they delivered these items very promptly.

I took the shuttle to and from the airport. On arrival I waited an hour for the shuttle bus (it comes every 90 minutes). It was on time, and seeing as I was at T3, it only took 20 mins to get to the hotel. Leaving the hotel, the schedule worked perfectly for me as well, and my stop was the first. Again, only 20 mins.

The location is good for chilling out ‚Äì there is the East Coast park, the coastal walk and ferries to Pulau Ubin just across the road from the hotel.

THE BAD:

My overnight flight from the UK arrived at 7.30am, check-in was only at 2pm. I guess I didn‚Äôt help myself by booking accommodation on a Saturday night.. meaning that there were unlikely to be any available rooms due to people checking-out early. I didn‚Äôt see any point in forking out another $200 to book the room for Friday night as well, only to use it for a few hours. I would have really appreciated having somewhere quiet to lie down and rest while I waited for the room to become available. A lounge chair in a quiet and dark room would have been bliss. Alas, my choices were (a) sun lounger by the downstairs pool, in full view of the dining room (b) sun lounger by rooftop pool, full of screaming kids. When I couldn‚Äôt battle my exhaustion any longer, I went with (a) only to snooze and wake up 30 mins later being ravaged by mosquitoes. I quickly went inside and took a seat inside the busy lobby, keen not to become another victim of dengue/ zika.

I was assured at 12pm that my room would be cleaned as a priority, so I could check in sooner. This didn‚Äôt happen. I still had to wait till 2pm.

The shower had an issue, meaning that if I wanted a shower and not a bath, I had to keep one hand keeping a button pulled ‚Äì it wouldn‚Äôt stay there on its own. The water wasn‚Äôt particularly warm either‚Ä¶ but for a quick shower it was ok.

The hotel was pricey at $200 per night (for Friday & Saturday night). I guess this is the going rate in Singapore.

THE UGLY:

So outside the hotel has turned into a big gathering of Pok√©mon Go players. At first when I saw the crowd, I thought they were all waiting for a bus. Then when the crowds got even thicker in the evening, I realised what was going on. Imagine hoards of young people, faces glued to their phones , shuffling around like zombies. It was a little annoying getting in and out of the hotel as they were crowding the pavements. I was there on the weekend, so I guess the effect was amplified. Occasionally there would be a stampede from one location to another, as I guess some ‚Äòspecial‚Äô Pok√©mon appeared nearby. They were still hanging around at 2am (by which point I was too tired to look out the window). The lobby seemed to have a lot of people there as well, sitting on the sofas‚Ä¶ I guess they were taking a break. And a big crowd in the downstairs toilets. I know that it is hard for the hotel staff to distinguish between guests and Pok√©mon intruders, but I wish they did a little bit of active monitoring, or put some signs up. I don‚Äôt know if this Pok√©mon thing is a permanent fixture, or was just happening while I was there.

I noticed on my second night that there were a lot of families in the pool area. I know families do come here for a staycation, and not to sound like a snob, but I noticed some of the crowd looked like they may not be able to afford the hotel. When coming down from the pool to the lobby, I was accompanied by a family with kids. They were dripping wet from the pool, wrapped up in hotel towels. They walked straight out of the lift (leaving behind a puddle), through the lobby, and out to the parking lot. I‚Äôm quite certain that they weren‚Äôt guests. In fact if you are not a guest, it‚Äôs very easy to come directly into the hotel, take the lift to the top floor (no access card required) and use the pool. There are no security checks.",2016-09-01,PreCovid,0

There are shuttles from the airport going here, but they leave every 60-90 minutes. Arriving late at night, I just took a taxi, which cost me around S$10. Check in was perfunctory, and I got an upgrade to a Club Floor room on the 6th floor.

The Club floor had a lounge, which served some snacks and drinks, but these were not available when I checked, as they only provide these until 9 PM. Made do with coffee.

The room itself was pretty large for Singapore standards, with modern, no-frills furnishing. Nothing jaw-dropping, but the bed was large and comfortable, and the bathroom had a tub and shower, which were all I need after a long flight.

They have a shuttle to the airport, the earliest of which leaves at 6 AM. Unfortunately, the breakfast buffet opens at 6:30, so was unable to try it. However, I was able to request for a takeaway box that I ate at the airport, which included fruit and some pastries.

I booked a club room and requested One with seaview because my husband absolutely loves that sort of view. We were given a room on the club room level, and I believe is partially facing the sea. We were turned off by the smokiness if the room. That was a disappointment because we lost the view we wanted. The staff at the reception upgraded us to a Jr. Suite room, which has a decent size. We expected the fridge to be filled with refreshments, but was told to proceed to club lounge. Bathroom amenities were basic, nothing value added for a club room. There was a toothbrush left behind on top on the silver looking glass, and these glasses are wet on the inside. That fell short of our expectation.

We had plan to have breakfast at the club lounge but the selection was poor. Scrambled egg was runny, waffles and Madeline was cold... The only nice thing at the lounge was the coffee and warmth service of the staff. We headed down to the Saltwater Cafe for breakfast to reconcile our disappointment. While we were there, we were surprised that several over club guests encountered the same disappointment at the lounge. The spread was better here, but the staff needs to attention to the dishes they have collected from the guests. They should consider placing it away from the sight of the guests.

The fire alarm went off about three times during bedtime. There were no proper announcement for the guests and we were in the room wondering if we should head out. When the announcement came, it mentioned there was a fire alarm and we need to gather at the lobby m, and three seconds later saying it was a false alarm. The fire alarm went off once more the next morning during breakfast. This was quite annoying because it seemed like the alarm went off because it was faulty.

couple,,False,,"Staycation ruined  Disappointment for my first staycation at Village Hotel. Here is my honest review

1) Food: no worries on food as it is nearby Changi Village- a place with good cafe, restaurant, bar and hawker foods. 4/5

When we first enter,

2) Area Location: good, but in a mess as places are filled with pokestops- advise not to head there if you are looking for quiet place. Place is right in front of major spawn area. Hence from early morning till morning (yes- from 7am to 4am) this place will be filled with crowds.)
Crowd control fails as it allows people to enter the hotel lobby and makemit so crowded and irritating.

- 1/5 for quiet staycation

3) In Hotel Services : Service staff abruptly hangup our phone when we try to ask nicely to get crowd away from hotel area as we need rest. The staff must be a pokemon player as well. Even if the staff can control area, they should at least stop pple from entering the hotel.
Players are entering Hotel through lift lobby even the lift requires card access. Unfortunately, once we swipe in the card, the people will hop on together and head to the infinity pool on the last level. In which it brings me to...

- 1/5 Privacy of hotel guest is compromised.

Nevertheless, we didnt get to enjoy pool because of the players, ended up staying within our room.

4) Room Service: food are not that bad.. probably on a higher side since nearby restaurant are slightly cheaper.

-3/5

Overall experience : never head down over the weekends. Unless u r playing pokemon and not relaxing.

SUGGESTIONS to hotel since staff didnt listen to us:

1) crowd control - avoid allowing no hotel visitors to come in and enjoy free aircon and hog lobby. Or even head up to guestpools.

2) treat hotel guest more politely, even when staff are busy.

Firstly, we didnt have to wait very long for the bus to the hotel where we were greeted by a lovely, warm and friendly receptionist (Liah? Leah? think her name was?) She was so helpful and informative and immediately we knew this hotel was a good choice!  We had a 'special' offer which was certainly well and truly worth it!  Our room was an executive club room, b/fast included, free bus tour, access to the lounge any time with complimentary snacks and hot/cold drinks, early room check in, airport lounge access.  In fact there were other complimentary things provided too which I cant remember now except to say we were pleasantly surprised at all the 'extras' included in our rate.  Breakfast in the lounge was very nice and we certainly would not have wanted more than was on offer.  We decided to have lunch in the main eating area that had a number of tasy dishes provided although most foods I tried in the bain-marie unfortunately were barely warm which was not great.  We did arrive fairly late for lunch but keeping food hot/above a certain temp is important in a bain-marie - not to mention enjoyment of the food itself?The staff, including Jyzrl and Fazuan, were all very helpful and accommodating in the lounge.We had a very nice view from our room where we could see the water beyond and certainly everything was clean, comfortable and noise not a problem.It is not as close to airport as some hotels being about 20 mins or so away.  However its location made me feel it had more of a holiday/resort atmosphere rather than if we'd just stayed in a room in the city or airport without the attractive surrounds that this hotel has.  Would certainly stay here again - in fact we wished we had a few nights here!

The hotel is only about 15 minutes from the airport but the bus leaves Terminal 1 and makes stops at Terminals 2 and 3 so it takes 25 minutes just to get out of the airport.  Also, the bus runs at 90 minute intervals so if you miss the bus, it could be be over 2 hours before you get to the hotel..or you can take a taxi which may be worth the cost if you are leaving from Terminal 1.  And returning to the airport, you may need to leave earlier than you would want or have a less time to check in.We also had to wait in line to check in because there was a large group that had just arrived.  But after we got to our room, it was very nice with a comfortable bed, hot water and water pressure, very good free wifi, and all the amenities we needed.It is also in a nice location where we went for a walk along the beach.

The room was clean and modern with a decent bathroom. Check-in was easy and they even gave cash to pay my taxi driver (whose credit card machine was broken) and added it to my bill, without any fuss whatsoever. 2 lovely pools - the rooftop one is fun as you can see planes descend into the nearby airport as you swim, as well as look out to sea. Buffet breakfast was more than adequate and all the staff members we came into contact with were lovely - a special thanks to Seraphina, who helped us out on a number of occasions. They also offer a couple of free shuttles each day into the city, which will save you a taxi fare, although we caught one back to the hotel outside of rush hour and it was only $20. I really liked the free mobile phone in each room, which allows you to make free international calls to certain countries as well as access the internet and which we used for local info when sightseeing in the city - what a great idea. We did hear some noise through the night from plane activity but we were jetlagged and on a different timezone, so were finding it difficult to sleep anyway. Beds were comfortable and the pillows were decent - when I did sleep, it was great. The hotel is located 5 minutes away from a food hawkers market - great fun and excellent value (both for food and beer!). There are also many other restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.

The staff are friendly the pools are both beautiful. My flight arrived very early (7am), however the staff still allowed me to check in upon my arrival. Super nice!

My only major complaint is the extremely slow and untimely shuttle service from the airport to the hotel that is not well marked or advertised at all. Upon arrival at Changi airport, I wandered around trying to find the shuttle pickup zone which was not marked. I then asked at an airport transportation kiosk (appeared to be for taxis only, which is not the case), and received a sticker identifying my hotel destination, and was told to go sit outside, where it was scheduled to stop in 15 minutes. I waited approximately 40 minutes until it arrived, and had the same issue later in the day when I attempted to take the shuttle back from the airport again, after a day exploring downtown Singapore.

The other direction (hotel to airport) worked well for me, and it seems they tightly schedule shuttle departures from the hotel to the airport, so at least you shouldn't miss your flight.

Overall, would return, but if time is tight and you don't like waiting in the heat outside an airport for an hour, you should probably just take a taxi.",2016-07-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel was fully booked but Shaik took the trouble to arrange for all of us to be on the same floor/wing at his own discretion.

The rooms are not spanking new but decent. The Executive Suite has a funny layout though and we didn't really like it.

While the hotel has two pools, we only used the one on the 8th floor. The view was spectacular and definitely one of the best things this hotel offers.

Another plus is its proximity to the laid-back Changi Village hawker centre. Everything seems to move at a slower pace there. The shops has a natural, organic retro feel to it.

The Village Hotel Changi was excellent in keeping our conference participants of 25, happy in many ways.

The gym was a highlight, with well stocked weights and elyptical machines.The dining experience in many ways, was a delight.  Under the able leadership of Head Server, Paul, the service was quick and cheerful.  Large and noisy tourist groups were directed to a private corner of the breakfast room, giving us conference participants more room to enjoy a less hurried pace of breakfast.  The variety of food available was much appreciated from Asian to European fare. Lunch was always well prepared; for starters chilled langoustines, mussels, prawns, and Alaskan crabs could be bathed in some great sauces. A small salad spread didn't leave behind the asian rojak.   The soups were well balanced with both creamy ones and Chinese clear soups.  Both soups more than passed the test.  However, the beef cheeks were the clear winner for most of us in my team, and the braised frog legs were a close hop behind that. The only criticism was what seemed to be a rehashed dish over two mealtimes - steamed glutenous rice parcels.. which were dry and rather disappointing. Desserts made all of us grown ups into kids once more, with no less than 9 toppings for ice cream, cream cakes, and petite fours.. all made the triumphant end to a meal... and how else to remain awake for the conference?

The location is actually very handy for Changi but a bit out of the way for downtown Singapore. We found the best way to access the city was to take the free shuttle to the airport and the the MRT (subway). We actually transited to the cruise ship terminal with baggage the following morning without difficulty.
The hotel building is somewhat off-putting resembling an old office block but do not be put off!

We did use the free shuttle to return to the airport. The hotel is situated in suburban Singapore so there is not much to do in the way of sight seeing. We appreciated being upgraded to a suite. The room was large and the bathroom was even larger. The room had all the necessities but was a bit ""tired"". Breakfast offered the usual of cereals plus omletes made to order. Staff were all very friendly and efficient. We didn't use the rooftop pool which looked very appealing apart from the fact there is no shade.

solo,,False,,"Very good hotel with excellent service I stayed here as a solo traveller for one night in June this year (2016).

Everything met my expectations, essentially. What you get is as advertised. The staff at the service counter were very helpful.

The only negative was that the free WiFi signal was quite weak in the room I stayed in to the point that it would drop out, so I needed to use it in central areas of the hotel. To be fair, I didn't address this with the hotel at the time, as my stay was very short and I was content to make do with accessing the WiFi in central areas - so there may have been a simple fix for all I know.

This is my fifth visit to Singapore - I visit frequently to catch up with friends, or as a stopover before seeing other parts of the world. In terms of location, Changi Village is admittedly a bit out of the way, and does not make for the best base if you are interested in exploring the rest of Singapore - if relying on public transport, you need to take a bus to the nearest MRT (train station), which opens up a lot more of the country to you - and even then, you need to travel at least ~20-30 mins West before you reach central areas. That said, there is a free shuttle service from the airport, and Changi Village is a worthwhile area to visit. The Changi Village Hawker Centre (a short walk from the hotel) is well worth checking out, including for the famous nasi lemak (MIzzy's Corner seems to be the popular one, judging by the queue), and also for the more adventurous, the hotel is close to Changi Point Ferry Terminal, where you can catch a tugboat to Pulau Ubin for a bike ride by the kampong.",2016-06-01,PreCovid,0

family,,False,,"Relaxing getaway  Spent 2 nights at the hotel for a quick get away with the family. We chose to stay at Changi as it is away from the bustle of the city and it felt like a real holiday. The hotel is located close to lots of eateries just 2 minutes walk away. There was so much to choose from that exploring them was an adventure in itself.

It's an old hotel but efforts have been made to refurbish it. It's clean, comfortable, with lovely staff. When we first arrived, the car park looked old but efforts have been made at energy-saving. Lights came on as we drove through looking for a lot.

Check-in was quick. We didn't have much of a view outside our room window but that's fine as we spent most our time outdoors. The beds were comfortable. The rooms were very cold and we slept with the aircon turned off. Perhaps it was the rainy season that contributed to the low temperature.

The swimming pool by Saltwater cafe on level one was quiet with ample outdoor furniture to relax on. You can swim here if you don't mind patrons at the restaurant watching you. Pool on level 8 was crowded, with very little space for seating. But it had a good view of the sea, nearby islands and aircraft flying overhead. The pools had ample amounts of warm fluffy towels for guests to use.

Buffet breakfast was lovely, with the usual salad, fruit, pastries, egg station, some local dishes like fishball noodles, congee, fried noodles. The pancakes & waffles were hard though.

We booked our hotel with a package to Pulau Ubin, which is only 10mins boat ride away. The package included a 3 hour bicycle rental. But the shop owner told us we could have the bicycles for the whole day. The island had rustic charm,with its old kampong type houses, stray dogs wandering around. Unfortunately it was the rainy season and we were swarmed by mosquitoes as we rode along the trail. We left the island within an hour and did not explore much at all.

We had a pleasant surprise on check out day. As my children loved the pool so much we called concierge to check if we could have a slightly later check-out. We were told that as we had bought the Ubin package we could in fact stay till 3pm.",2016-06-01,PreCovid,1

The other room next door, without balcony, had cigarette smell although it was a non-smoking level. Concierge promptly changed our room, with a staffer spraying air freshener while we were waiting for the room. Appreciate that. Changed into a room that overlooks the courtyard, which perhaps due to low occupancy, we found it slightly dustier than the one with seaview, but bearable.

Infinity pool had a pungent smell (not from the water, but probably the nearby water tanks). Pretty amazing when the planes fly past but expect it to be crowded at sunset.

Managed to get early check-in and late check-out. Pretty pleased with the service of hotel. Good for 1-2 nights' staycation away from the buzzling town and marina staycation most of us would go to.

family,,False,,"Don't use it as a day hotel I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past 3 years. Both have been very different experiences. The first time was an overnight stopover and the shuttle was excellent (run every hour) and the room was clean and fresh, if a little old.  The bed was comfortable and the location is great for a quiet stopover.So I was happy to go there again when needing a day hotel for a sleep and rest before the final leg of my journey from Europe to Australia with my adult daughter.  Our travel agent gave us a list of hotels that offered a day rate (ie 9am - 9pm) and as I had stayed there before I chose the Village Hotel Changi and the requirement for twin beds was clearly stated on the booking form.When we arrived just after 9am we were told that the only room available had a double bed.  I explained that I was travelling with my adult daughter and we had specifically booked a room with twin beds.  The receptionist just repeatedly told me that they were fully booked overnight and as check in time was 2pm they had no room with a double bed for us until then.  I then explained that we had a day room booking, from 9am to 9pm and that we had already booked and paid for a twin day room.  I ended up asking to speak to the manager.  He explained that the cleaning staff do not start until 9am and he would get us a room a soon as they had one cleaned.So I am wondering why Village Hotel Changi offer a day room from 9am when they cannot guarantee that you can get into your room at that time??We did get a room with twin beds half an hour later, but this would not have happened if I had not have been assertive and asked to see the manager.  I felt very uncomfortable during the whole episode.  When we did get to the room it was certainly of a lower standard that I remember from 3 years ago.  There was mould in the bathroom, lots of dirty marks on the walls and the floor was not very clean.  They were changing the lock system so we had to get the manager to let us back into the room whenever we went out.  Thank heavens we only wanted to sleep and have a shower before our next flight.   Not sure if I would want that room if we wanted to go out and about a couple of times.  So, I don't think I will be returning to this hotel.",2016-05-01,PreCovid,0

My family and I did not manage to secure a good night's rest as we were subjected to the multiple commotions that happen throughout the night coming from our neighbors' rooms. There are people shouting/talking loudly even while doing a simple task like walking along the corridors. This is not taking into the fact that loud sounds, similar to a giant stamping his foot, greets us periodically throughout the night from level 8.

There is a lack of control on the visitor numbers at the infinity pool on level 8. This makes for a much less than perfect enjoyment during our 1st visit (evening of 12 March around 5pm) when we counted there are at least 30 persons crowded in and around the pool.

Many aspects of the infinity pool were poorly managed, for e.g. tiles around the pool were popping out (safety hazard), one of the lamps at the Jacuzzi area was even dislodged from it holding position (electrical hazard). Many a times I have seen swimmers busily removing dead leaves and flowers which fell into the pool, instead of enjoying themselves.

The sliding door to the superficial balcony would not close properly. I specifically asked for s quiet room, and it was anything but: road noise, noise from neighbouring rooms and noise from aircraft taking off from nearby Changi Airport all contributed to every night's being disturbed. That said the room was functionally ok and the bed was comfortable. The other main problem was the WiFi - painfully slow and needing continual re-entry of logon data.

On the plus side, all of the staff were helpful and friendly to a person. Had they not been, this would probably have been a 2. The fitness centre was good and the floor-8 pool boasts a lovely view to the north.

The rooms are not very well soundproofed, which is ridiculous as the location is right under the airport approach path. Also noise from neighboring rooms like walking, talking or closing doors can clearly be heard. The overall condition of rooms and hallways looks tired and in need of a major overhaul.

I landed at the airport and found my way to the shuttle departure area and asked after The Village Shuttle, that had just departed.    I was up the front of the plane and one of the first off so I wasn‚Äôt late.   I thought that was silly of it not to board all registered guests.A little disgruntled I took a taxi at about a $20 cost.   At the hotel the shuttle was still running in the driveway, those guests somehow ahead of me had just arrived and I waited for them to complete check in.I checked in and I was first given a scruffy box of a room half a mile down the hall.   It was small, tatty and a long way from everything.   I asked for a room worthy of the $190 odd dollars I was paying, and then I was given the room I should have been given in the first place.

No signing back in whenever you move around the hotel.It was good to see them scrubbing the lobby seats hard with a strong vacuum at night.  I wanted a drink like a red wine but, the lobby bar was closed and the room did not feature as such.    Drinks are hideously expensive and I don‚Äôt just mean alcohol.   $9 was the asking price on water, and $13 for Corona that is a very cheap Mexican beer being sold touted like a premium beer from Belgium.  Not the best start‚Ä¶ they tried to put me in a very sub-standard room, nothing to drink and no internet. 'Oh no‚Äô I think as I find the ‚Äòover-the-bath shower‚Äô complete with a curtain.

The pools upstairs were quite nice and had a very nice view.On departure I was told the shuttle was 30 minutes away.  Concierge set my bags beside the door after check-out.  I paced up and down the lobby chatting to staff explaining I was waiting for the shuttle.   After 45 minutes I asked after it and was told to wait because it was 'coming soon'.  At about an hour I explained to staff I was going to the bathroom and to hold the shuttle if it came.    I came out from the bathroom and waited another 45 minutes.   I asked again and was told I had missed the shuttle, despite the whole staff knowing I had been waiting the whole time.   I spotted a man who looked like the boss and he was.  I approached him and explained this whole experience to him.  He was busy, he was preoccupied.

And so, I booked a Deluxe room under their 'Birthday Treat' promotion, and got a complimentary upgrade to Club room with Club access and breakfast. On the arrival day, we were allowed to check-in early as the room had been blocked for us.  However, I was rather disappointed to find the Club room located on club floor (level 6) to be of equal or smaller size than Deluxe and/or Superior room. The bed configuration which I requested for, has been mixed up too. I stayed in a Superior room previously, and it was much bigger.  Nevertheless, I approached the front desk for a change of room.  The duty manager was attentive and offered a roll-away bed free of charge. Another front desk lady looked into our request for a room with balcony, and after 2 rooms viewing, we decided to take the Deluxe room on level 7 with an enclosed balcony.  Frankly speaking, there is no difference in room size or amenities in Club room compared to Deluxe.  I prefer Deluxe as it is on higher floor than Club. Under this 'Birthday Treat' promotion, we were entitled to club access, so we didn't mind the actual room category. The club experience was very nice, with its attentive waitress and waiter, free flow of beverages and nespresso coffee.  There was a limited selection of nespresso capsules, but good enough for non hardcore coffee drinker like me. They also provided light pastries in early afternoon. However, the pastries were not refilled.  It would be nice, if they were refillable. From 6 - 8pm, canapes were served with both alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Club is opened till 11pm, so we chilled out there after our dinner.        The bed was very comfortable, and the temperature was just nice.  The bathroom design is rather out-dated.  There is no standing shower, only a bathtub, which you have to leap over every time you want to shower.  Although there is a rubber floor mat, it still gets very slippery, and inconvenience for kids or old folks to leap over. In most of the newer hotel chains, bathtub has given way to enclosed standing shower, which takes up lesser space and save more water. I think V hotel needs to refurbish the room and bathroom to keep up with the competition from no-frail hotel chains in downtown. Seriously, without the complimentary upgrade, I would not have paid so much more for club room with same (or even smaller) size and club access.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,1

As when we arrived we had the pleasure of making our check-in with Ms Sherlina, who gave us not only useful tips but made us feel really welcome. Eastern hospitality indeed. We got an upgrade to a big and very comfortable suite. The only thing missing was a plug for our big bathtub. We had to use our creativity to keep the water from running away...
The hotel is very well located near the main street of Changi Village, which has kept the feel of a small town, with restaurants full of local people and a typical market where you can eat breakfast or any other meal. At walking distance, there is a nice promenade along the seaside (it‚Äôs part of a National Park) and you can take one of the small ferries to visit other places around. Nothing touristic, but real. Singapore is an extremely well kept and clean city and it is really pleasant to take a walk.
The free airport shuttle runs every 90 minutes. In fact, we waited more than 2 hours to start the tour along the terminals and finally to the hotel. The trip back to the airport the next day went much smoother because a friendly employee let us know when it would depart and we were called when it was ready to leave.

family,,False,,"Short school holidays where to go? A friend contacted me few weeks ago.""Are you going changi this March holidays?,"" asked my friend. ""How do you know?"" was my reply.. By now most of my good friends know that I am a regular in this hotel because this is indeed a family friendly, value added hotel.

My friend was deciding between Sentosa hotel and Changi and I managed to convince her this is the ideal place if you are not getting out of Singapore.

I have mentioned about the complimentary bowling and cycling so many times but let me tell you the club house. It serves free flow of drinks and fruits throughout the day. The best part is the cocktail from 6-8pm. Wine is served and kids above 12 can join the parents to eat inside the club house. However, parents are allowed to bring the food to the younger kids outside. The staff at the club lounge are super friendly making sure that your kids' dining needs are well taken care too.

I would definitely want to thank Yazid and the team. I wish I didn't miss out on the staff names but there goes the list.

The lovely reception and club staffs are sherlina,Gian, christine, fazlon, Fazuan, Nia, Loreen and Fahmi.

They went the extra mile from ensuring early check in, right to balloons in the rooms for the young ones and even to helping me charge my hand phone.

I know it might be cheaper going over the causeway but forget about the hassle of bringing a passport and travelling so far.. With the beach at your doorsteps and such warm services provided, you sure will want to come back again and again.

solo,,False,,"Very disspaointing experiance. With a 1 AM arrival and a late check out the next day I was only here for 15 hours.
I paid top dollar for the room 5 months in advance based on reviews I had read.
I ordered the Buffet Breakfast on arrival and with that i had paid just under $300 Singapore dollars for my 15 hour stopover.
My room number 408 was a good size, a bit bland but ok. No real wow factor.
The surprises where sprung on me the next morning. I woke up with the sniffles and sneezing. I soon discovered the issue. Thick dust around most of the skirting boards and other areas. The main bench areas had been dusted but the rest of the room had not seen a dust cloth in some time. i'm allergic to dust mite.
The worst was the Bathroom area. A putrid old non slip bath mat covered in mould spores, Yuck. Ample mould in the tile grouting around the shower/bathtub area. Even the shower curtain had started sprouting mould spores it was just sickening. Please see attached pictures.
Upon showing the pictures to the duty manager on check out I was quickly refunded my Breakfast cost which was nice of them and then oddly informed that I had been upgraded at no additional charge, really a upgrade to a dirty room, gee thanks.
The duty manager was not keen on coming up and seeing the room as I suggested. I think the pictures where more than enough.
Based on other reviews i'm hoping my experience here is the exception and not the rule .
Even the area where I was asked to sit and wait for the duty manager in the bar/dinning area had filthy stained chairs that had not seen a fabric cleaner or stain remover in some time.
Some positives. The staff where friendly.The hotel has a nice roof top pool with great views. The Wi-Fi was strong and the buffet Breakfast was fine. A free shuttle service is available to and from the airport. or about $15-$20 by taxi.
Its a shame that my biggest memory will be how dirty it was and how I now have my first terrible review on Trip advisor.
Im sorry but for nearly $300 Singapore dollars per night I expect a clean room. A little bit of dust and mould I can understand but this was excessive and disgusting in every aspect.
Better value can be found anywhere else in Singapore for sure.",2016-01-01,PreCovid,0

I am just an average person and havent done anything then to be remembered after...

The staff are very pleasant and classy, not overdoing in presence, and they will pop up exactly when you need them. Not pushy or overdoing in anything or any way.
Just natural, and for sure not artificial smile. Especially Sheda and Fazuan are the outstanding ones, but the rest too, i just dont remember all the names.

The location is not very convenient but is well surrounded by various eateries. As it is located away from the bustling area, hence it is quiet and peaceful. 10 minutes walk to the beach and situated right in front of the ferry terminal to Palau Ubin. Upon check-in, we saw that late check out at 4pm is available for club member. But the reception told us as a matter of fact that it is not available when we request for it. Not a good start. The room is spacious, decently clean and comfortable but you can see the very obvious mold at the aircon area. Bathroom is okay, however the bathtub is stained with dirty yellow marks. Don't even feel like standing there to bath. Breakfast at the club area have limited varieties. When we enter into the club area, no one bother to serve or greet us. But I do see them greeting and serving other guests. We went there an hour before the end of breakfast time and the food is not replenished, so I guess you have to go really early for breakfast.

Concierge/Bell man: Waited around 15 mins for my luggage and it didn't arrive. I walked back down to the lobby to get them to assist with bringing the luggage up. Bell man was really friendly though.

Room was nice, modern and clean.
Bed was very comfortable. Toilet was also very good. Amenities in the room was adequate.

Service center takes a really long time to answer calls. Requested for 2 additional blankets as my kids were feeling extremely cold, a male svc agent questioned me 'how many people are there in my room' I said 3. He responded 'are you sure?' He claimed that he could only send one and slammed the phone. I am sure these calls are being recorded. Please go ahead and retrieve the calls.

Facilities / Ambiance in the hotel: Hotel lobby was packed and I could easily tell people were checking in due to flight delays. Even then, reception did a good job at having group check-in in one counter and the other individual check-in in another.

Pool was really nice. Pool was on the 8th floor and had a really good ambiance. Pool towels were readily available.
I need to highlight an incident that took place. I booked a room in this hotel to celebrate my nephew's bday. After the celebration my family and I went up to the 8th floor by the pool area. The wooden planks on the floor was not even and that caused my grandma to trip and she had a really bad fall.

Spoke to the night duty manager about the incident as I didn't want anyone else to be a victim of the uneven flooring on the 8th floor. He took down the details of the incident.

Asked for ice cubes. It was shoved to us by the staff who seems really unhappy to be sending ice lol.

Basically if you are looking for a nice stay with good perks because it's a special weekend, try other hotels. This one seems to go by the book and doesn't want to make the effort of going the extra mile.

If you are intending to do some sight-seeing in the city centre then I would not recommend this hotel as quite a faff to access public transport. The nearest MRT station is a twenty minute bus ride away (the bus stop is right outside the hotel and you will require the exact bus fare, as no change given). When you reach the bus station, you then have a half an hour journey by MRT to the city centre. Otherwise, you can catch a taxi, which takes about 25-30 minutes, which could be pricey(?)

First and foremost, the hotel offers airport shuttle service approximately every 90 minutes. The shuttle ride was about 10 minutes in each direction, although it can be longer depending on which of the 3 terminals you are traveling to or from, as the shuttle stops at each terminal. To catch the free shuttle from the airport, stop by the Ground Transportation Desk in any terminal for pick-up instructions. Check-in and check-out was flawless, and the staff was friendly and professional.  Oddly there is also a once-daily one way shuttle service to the Village Hotel Bugis in central Singapore departing at 10:30 a.m., but it does not offer return service. The lobby is a nice size with plenty of space, but lacks adequate seating.  My king room on the 4th floor of this large mid-rise atrium style hotel was spacious, with a mini-fridge, hot water pot, coffee and tea service, and a large work desk with a comfortable ergonomic chair. The free Wi-Fi connection speed was adequate, albeit a little slow at times.  The bed was comfortable, and the room was dark and quiet for sleeping.  The bathroom had a full size tub with a glass wall and the shower had good pressure with plenty of hot water. Although the basin was large, the vanity was small.  The large closet included a terry robe and slippers.  The average sized LCD TV had plenty of international channels.  The hotel gym on the 5th floor is very well equipped with a complete assortment of both weight-training and cardio equipment. The infinity style edgeless design swimming pool on the 8th Floor is small, but does offer great views of Singapore.  The area surrounding the hotel (‚ÄúChangi Village‚Äù) has numerous small shops and eating establishments to serve any budget or taste all within close walking distance. While not quite as nice as the Crowne Plaza which has the advantage of being located within Singapore‚Äôs airport, this hotel is still highly recommended for an airport stay in Singapore.  My only caveat is that if the Crowne Plaza and this hotel are the same price, the Crowne Plaza should be your first choice due to its superior location and nominally higher quality, but this hotel is still a very good option.",2016-01-01,PreCovid,0

,,False,,"Staycation was abit disappointed from what I was promised via email.
room facing & arrangement was totally different as told. breakfast was so so even I had paid for the 2 days of stay. fried kway tio, egg, hash brown. etc. more on a simply food. personally feel not worth pay S$20 for that.
Room condition was average. nothing much to mention fo rthe room.
I am thankful that I was given free access to the club.
I cant complain much as I need not pay for the access. staff at the club & hotel are nice & friendly.
however i feel that the hotel can do more for those that pay to access the club, i went up at about 9pm as i need a winer opener. i was told that they dont have any. also when i ask if i can have an re apple, they to me no more... .. my next staycatiion will be somewhere else....",2015-12-01,PreCovid,1
family,,False,,"Loads of activity and great location We checked in very quickly. We notice that this hotel is catered mainly for large families and guest on a stopover.

Despite it was a pleasant stay and great location. Its by Changi beach and the Changi coastal walk is a must for anyone. We decided to test the food @ Saltwater. We had Christmas lunch and breakfast. The pastries were good and kudos to the pastry chef. Chef Steven was very helpful guiding me on food items that I can eat since I have loads of allergies.

The room was spacious but the drainage can be improved. It takes a long time for the water to be drained from the shower room as well as from the double vanities.

If one has no patience to wait for lifts its your dream hotel as at any one time a guest waits no more than 2 minutes.

family,,False,,"Excellent stay, small lapses in service This is our 5th stay at this hotel. Location is excellent, with close proximity to rustic Pulau Ubin and the famous hawker centre. Christine at the concierge offered us an upgrade to Executive Suite for $140++ (incl breakfast for 4, additional bed, sofa bed, 2 free pc of laundry and access to Club Lounge) which we couldn't get online / via phone. I just wonder why this room has never been offered to us! It's excellent for a family of 4 and I no longer have to endure lack of sleep thru sharing a bed with my fast-growing boys. The extra large bathtub, separate shower, extra living room and 2 huge TV screens made our stay feel so luxurious. Staff at the Concierge, Club Lounge and Housekeeping were also helpful and service oriented. TIPS: (a) Ask for food to feed the Koi at the Koi Pond. We got 2 packets free when we quoted our room number (2) Get the complimentary bike rental. It's really relaxing to bike around Changi Beach. Suggestions for improvement: 1) Ventilation was not good. When we turned off the room air-conditioning as it got too cold, the room smelt terribly of cigarette smoke! We asked Housekeeping for help and they brought an anti-odour spray, which wasn't any help at all. What we needed was an aircon technician! 2) the wooden cover under the sink fell out! 3) Bathtub area needs a shower screen else the floor (which is quite slippery) got all wet 4) egg counter staff at Saltwater Lounge were overwhelmed on Sunday and did not want to take orders from guests. Asked me to take the scrambled eggs from the buffet line instead, which I couldn't as I don't take diary products (eggs looked very milky). Had to make 2 trips back before they were ""free"" to take orders from my omelette, which was also overcooked and pathetic in terms of ingredients. When we asked for extra mushrooms, basically the chef scooped up air to dunk into the omelette. Service on Monday (21/12) was better by the same chef when there were fewer people. 4) I understand the Club Lounge is mainly for executives, but it was disappointing that my younger boy couldn't go in as he is under 12 (he's 9), even though he's mature and keeps quiet. Couldn't make use of the lounge to relax at all, but at least the staff were nice to let us bring some snacks and drinks to our room. 5) Shower area needs a shampoo/ shower gel holder or shelf. 6) Our plates were not cleared even though we left them outside the room for 2 days! Plus there was a dead moth on the corridor window ledge there through our entire stay that wasn't cleared. Otherwise, mostly, housekeeping was good, helping us set up the sofa bed and extra bed in a jiffy and prompt with requests on towels etc. Overall, keep up the good work Changi Village Hotel!

1. Changi Point Jetty - Boat Trip to Pulau Ubin
2. Changi Beach - Laze around on the Beach
3. Changi Hawker Center - Lots of local food
4. Restaurants - Western / Japanese / Malay / Indian / Middle Eastern etc dishes.

Morning breakfast was decent, enough spread to keep it interesting. There are 2 pools in the hotel, one @ level 8 which gives quite a good view of the surrounding areas (we spotted quite a few eagle flying overhead, and another just outside the restaurant.

Together with the junior suite, we are also able to access the lounge @ lvl 6, which is quite nice for a quiet coffee.

,,False,,Comfortable stay Stayed 1 night for a stopover. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room we stayed in was fairly nice. It was tidy but attention to detail wasn't had. For example there was hair in our bathroom and some stains on the carpet. It was a comfortable stay though and would definitely go back.,2015-12-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Oh my days-what a disappointment. The hotel looks very impressive when you first walk in.
Check in was simple and efficient but we were not really given much information about how to get to our room, how to work the lifts, where things were etc.
When we eventually found our room on the 4th floor, the first thing that hit us when we walked in was the over powering smell of urine. The room was small and there was no balcony and we were in a corner in a triangle shaped building so the shape of the room reflected that and our view was of a wall in another part of the triangle.
The plus point is it was quite close to the lift.

When the room had been booked for us, we were led to believe we were getting a ""superior"" room and what we got looked nothing like the pictures on the web. I guess we could have lived with that if it was not for the strong smell of urine.

I went downstairs back to reception and told the young lad that our room was not acceptable because of this. His initial answer was ""but madam this is a deluxe room"" which was probably not the best thing to say. I said it was not acceptable to have a room smelling of urine in a room of any standard anywhere in the world. To be fair to the lad, he offered me the chance to look at another room on the same floor and gave me a pass key. I went back upstairs to find it did not work. I came back downstairs to him to tell him and he told me to go back and have another go. I went back upstairs and it still did not work..so I went back downstairs again. By this time, I was not amused. When he insisted I go back a 3rd time, I said for him to come with me. He was not amused either when his pass key did not work either and he had to key in some code so we could gain access to the room.

The room was a little better as the cigarette smoke was more appealing than the urine. We changed rooms just glad to settle and try and get some sleep after a very long flight.

We then discovered that the bathroom was filthy, littered with hair and pubic hair and my partner got bit by some sort of bed bug. When I put the TV on, I got the message ""this service is currently unavailable""..as there was no signal. All those free channels and I couldn't see any of them.
Even more bizarrely, the room lights switched themselves all off at 9.30pm even with the card thing in the slot and we had to switch everything back on again manually.
In reverse, at half past midnight when we were asleep, every light in the room, including cupboards lights, shaving lights, bathroom lights etc switched themselves on waking us up and had to be manually switch off. This happened again at 3.30am, at which point I abandoned the idea of any sleep.

The salvation for me, laid awake, was that we had free wifi and I was able to post plenty of pictures and updates online about the state of the room!

We left the hotel at 6am, unable to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast they offered us by way of apology over the room and quite frankly, I have never been so relieved to get out of any hotel.

The plus point for us what that the staff we did deal with were as helpful as they could possibly be but our experience was hugely disappointing. I would not recommend and I would not return based on our one and only poor experience although I am sure this is a good hotel for the transit traveler or someone on a business visit.",2015-11-01,PreCovid,0
family,,False,,"Convenient location Great for a 2 night stopover in Singapore where one want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the city area. Had western breakfast across the road in a cafe, very expensive! Breakfast for 2 came to over 35 dollars! Shocking.

couple,,False,,"Was Average & Still Average Had spent a few weekends of staycation at this establishment over the last few years what attracted us was the charm of the locality, Changi Village known to be a lay back seaside destination for locals for relaxation & highly rated food choices at the hawker center & surrounding shops/restaurants.

Appreciating the reservation department invitation to stay & receive a free upgrade to the executive club room on my birthday month we decided to spend a day at the place & to check out on the latest developments around the vicinity, having adjusted my schedule & with the kind assistance from Ms Diana from the reservation center we extended another day stay at the hotel within the promotion rate.

En-route to the hotel we noticed quite a fair bit of changes within the place, the club house building opposite the hotel is fully completed since our last visit & so is the renovation at the popular hawker center & some newly operating outlets which excite us to look forward to seeing more new & improved developments in the village.

Our anticipation on arrival at the hotel was a bit disappointed as obviously visually nothing was change or improve since our last visit.

From a guest opinion, a major renovation may not be necessary in the pipeline management but replacing those dim & flickering light fittings at the car park, the stained carpet, chipped sanitary wares in the rooms & having a bold front desk reception counter instead of 2 small counters that looks like ticket collecting stands will definitely play a main factor in welcoming guests.

No comments on the breakfast spreads which is generous even though the choices remained the same & is fine to change from table serving to self help serving on hot beverages but do monitor on the frequency of refilling the pots.

The proximity advantages of the hotel location is perfect when use for promoting staycation packages & am very sure if details are consider the rating of the property will increase for the delight of your all guests.

Thank you for the hospitality rendered during our stays & looking forward to our next visit & hopefully with some changes to entice us & others guests a more frequencies of patronage to your staycation packages.",2015-12-01,PreCovid,1

Mr Ridzan came immediately and efficiently restored the power .Twice. He was very helpful even provided a new kettle on the spot. I would recommend this hotel. Good staff, friendly, no sour faces.

couple,,False,,"Good room, good location, disruptive housecleaning We decided to have a staycation and wanted a place far in the east side of Singapore, and half-stumbled onto Village Hotel Changi thanks to TripAdvisor's location search. As compared to the rest of the accommodation in the area, the reviews seemed most favourable.

When we arrived to check in around 4 pm, the lobby was empty and serene. Excellent and clean decor, if a little spartan. The helpful receptionist promptly confirmed our booking. We could even upgrade our package to include buffet breakfast, but decided to stick to our original decision of looking for food at the very nearby Changi Village Food Centre.

The 7th storey rooms corridor was not air-conditioned, which may not be a bad thing if you're environmentally-minded. Room air-conditioning was nice and cold, in fact, too cold for us skinny souls even when turned to the highest temperature. We slept with air-conditioning on only for the first night, as a result.

Room furnishings were spartan too, though standard and exuded class. Soft and warm colours, including the standard wood decor. There was a standard work table and an ergonomic chair for the business traveller to get work done. For a hotel room for 2, it was big, however, I would not really deem it Deluxe big.

Our sleep experience was eventful.. very eventful, and negative overall. On the first night things were alright except for the usual 1st-night-unfamiliar-bed syndrome. On the second night we experienced issues with the controlled switching system of the master switch. It did not seem to turn off all the lights consistently, leaving 1 on at the end of the switching sequence. That may be the wardrobe light, or the corner lampstand. What made it a little spooky was that ALL the lights turned themselves on after about 10 to 15 seconds. My poor dear was quite alarmed that this happened 3 times in a row without fail. Thankfully, I apparently solved the matter by toggling the shower heater switch off (this switch does not have an LED light to indicate operational state). The following morning, we slept in and were constantly awakened by the house-cleaning personnel knocking things around in the neighbouring rooms. That was a very unpleasant experience because we expected a quiet getaway from the usual shenanigans of our HDB neighbours. The randomly-timed thuds went on for at least half an hour on top of the renovation being done to the rooftop meeting rooms.

The 3rd night's sleep was marred by thuds and noises made apparently by fellow hotel guests, and it seemed like the intervening walls are not built thickly or solidly enough. Also (being a Friday night), it seemed that people were using the rooftop pool and the filtration system's hum (or perhaps the jacuzzi's pump) could be heard even till midnight.

If you're a deep sleeper, all these will not get you down at all. In fact, you will find it remarkable that a hotel with this level of luxury and amenities exists in the eastern corner of the island. Otherwise, do indicate that you want to avoid the 7th floor, and want a room far from the lifts so that you won't hear kids stomping their way past your door.

The gym has an excellent array of weights and aerobics machines, of the type you see at serious sports and physical training institutions. There is an attached toilet with showers. There is ample supply of bottled water and towels. However, we never actually saw anybody working out, and also didn't get to try it out for ourselves.

There is actually a ground-level pool behind the dining areas, seems like it can only be accessed by walking past all the tables? The rooftop pool, on the other hand, is small but provides a great view and has a good number of deck chairs. No infinity concept though.

There is a rooftop garden on the 6th floor with a koi pond that is currently struggling with enthusiastic algal growth. The koi are healthy and lively, and while we were there, the lotus plants actually bloomed. Mynahs (all of the plump and juicy variety) will congregate on the rooftop water tank fencing or hunt for food in this garden.",2015-12-01,PreCovid,1

We called housekeeping TWICE to ask them to come with air freshener. The person who came just sprayed at the 4 corners of the room and left without saying a word.
The cigarette smell didn't go away at all.
I saw a disclaimer on my booking paper that says, a $200 fine will be imposed on those who are caught smoking in the rooms.

family,,False,,"Quiet and peaceful place, lots of place to eat Stayed here for two nights during a family vacation.

We had two Superior Rooms (which was probably the cheapest rooms available).

The hotel is located far away from major business area and residential area, but they do provide shuttles to/from the airport and from other properties managed by the same group. You can get here easily by cab, though.

The hotel was well maintained. The interior spaces were well lit, spacious, and clean. The staff we encountered were friendly.

The rooms were quite spacious too, and clean and well maintained. Our only disappointment was that we were given rooms looking out into the courtyard (which was quite a boring place to look at), and directly opposite the hotel's gym. In other words, people using the gym can see into our rooms. If we ever stay here again, we would request rooms not looking into the courtyard or, if all their Superior Rooms face the courtyard, pay more to get better rooms. On a positive note, though, we didn't hear any traffic noise; not that there were lots of traffic around the hotel to begin with.

The hotel has two swimming pool, the Creek Pool on the ground floor and the Infinity Pool on the eighth.

The Creek Pool was virtually deserted during our two days' stay. To get to the pool, you literally have to walk through the restaurant (Saltwater Cafe). While you swim, patrons at the restaurant would be staring at you. Not very conducive for a relaxed swim. This was probably the reason why no one used the pool.

The Infinity Pool was quite nice. We visited the pool several times and most times there were other people using it. Being on the eighth floor gives you a nice view of the surrounding area. The pool is also larger than the one on the ground floor, and offers a more conducive environment for relaxation. The pool opens late into the night too, so we were able to enjoy a swim here after dinner.

Wifi in the room and in the hotel was adequate. We did not encounter any connectivity issue.

The prices at the restaurants were comparable to similar hotel restaurants downtown, which is a little high considering the location of the hotel. Fortunately, eating places are aplenty at Changi Village, which is literally just across the road from the hotel. We enjoyed good meals during our stay here, at less than a third of what we would have to pay if we had eaten at the hotel.

If you are looking for activities, there are plenty of activities available in the area. The hotel provides complimentary bicycle rental, an hour per person per day. So you could just ride the bike and explore the area; which we did. Unfortunately, the company that the hotel used for the bicycles provided bikes that were not well maintained: they look dated and dirty compared to those offered by some other bicycle rental shops in the area. They had limited bikes available too.

Alternatively, you could either spend time at the nearby beach, or just take a stroll along the Changi Point Boardwalk. For the more adventurous, you could take a ferry over to Ubin Island.

This area has a relaxed atmosphere, so the idea is to just enjoy the day away from the hustles and bustles of city life.

We had an exhausting two flights from NZ and needed to sleep and stay for 12 hours until our flight to South Africa.

It's located near to a market with local food as well as fast foods like Subway. The boats to the nearby island costs S$2 and there are more restaurants there too.

The hotel was having a bit of a refresh with works going on on the top level but they didn't encroach on the pool or outdoor space. The gym was functional but air-conditioned in the floor room would be a nice addition.  My only real disappointment was the breakfast : a real let down and thought it was all high carb muffins and cakes things  or processed meats like luncheon or spam.

It might not be in the middle of the city but it is quite close to the airport. I was there with my wife and 2 boys in September 2015 and thought we would have to get 2 rooms but with the kind management, we were upgraded to a suite that takes four people saving us money on getting 2 rooms plus we could all be together and not in separate rooms.The first time i stayed at this hotel it was with my wife and that was back in November 2014 and we loved it back then as well.  This time it was even better as we had the benefit of the club lounge and it was fantastic.  The staff were so friendly and the lady who cooks the eggs for you in the breakfast dinning room on the ground floor was fantastic.I didn't get her name but by the second morning she new what i would order eggs sunny side up with the bacon.  she was there working when we were there back in November last year and i think she remembered me. as soon as she noticed me approaching the Bacon and egg servery every morning  i was there she had the eggs and Bacon on. Brilliant.The staff were everywhere to help you even to get out of the taxi or to get a taxi.My wife had asked the lady cleaning the rooms as we were passing her if she could get us an extra pillow which she said no problem, now i have stayed in other hotels and asked for things from house keeping and it has never arrived and i have had to ask a number of times for it to be delivered but with Village Changi Hotel Singapore it was there when we got back to the room.  i found every staff member from house keeping to reception and concierge to restaurant staff were very friendly and very helpful and only have to ask once for an extra pillow or an extra towel and when you get back it's there.  the pool on the roof is beautiful and very refreshing pity about the view as the whole of Singapore was under thick smoke from the fires in Indonesia. Apparently Singapore gets hit with the smoke from Indonesia every 2 years but i was told this was the worst 400 on the pollution count, very bad.  I feel sorry for the people of Singapore as they have to breathe this pollutant every 2 years. stop your polluting Indonesia it is ruining the planet. Apparently what i was told is Indonesia burns the forests to clear the land for agriculture. Bad very bad.   Back to the fine hotel, there is even a pool next to the restaurant down stairs with glass sides and the gardens there are fantastic well manicured and well maintained. If you do decide to stay at this hotel i highly recommend paying that little bit extra and get the club room as we found it great after a day out to drop into the lounge and get a snack and a cold soft drink or fruit juice and it was included in the club room grade. then there was free cocktails after 6pm i think it was. i have stayed at a lot of hotel around the world and even the top 5 star hotel don't give this type of service.  The top 5 star hotels i find are too big and too many guests to be able to give this type of service.  This Hotel might not be in the middle of the city but it makes up for it in fantastic friendly service and very clean and very fresh hotel.  nothing is too much problem. you also have a hawker food market right next door very nice and very busy.

Hotel amenities that we did try out were fantastic. The pools were utterly enjoyable (on the days the haze cleared enough) and my daughter had great fun plane spotting at the infinity pool. Breakfast variety was limited but still acceptable. I was delighted to find that the breakfast menu did change unlike other hotels who tend to serve the same fare everyday. The koi pond was also an easy way to keep the children entertained and we enjoyed the tranquility there.

The best part about this hotel is its location right smack in Changi Village. Just a few steps out and you can experience some of the best hawker fare the nation offers. Grab the complimentary bike ride and cycle over to Changi coast for a day at the beach and end it chilling out at nearby bars. The huge number of convenience stores nearby and availability of ATMs from the 3 major savings banks in SG also means you will always be able to buy whatever you forgot to pack!

Pros:
- Location is nearer to my job location i.e. Changi Business Park
- Location is very nice lush green with with presence of a veriety of birds such as Pied Hornbill, (White) Kokatu and many more
- Location is on the sea shore.. so frequently I go for a sea shore walk
- Complimentary breakfast is good
- Few Indian food outlets including vegetarian options are available nearby
- Rooms are specious and very nicely designed
- Service staff is very efficient and courteous. I would like to make a special mention Ms. Aisha, room attendant who is very good in room cleaning
- Two pools are great for relaxation in the evening after hectic day schedule
- Airport is nearer. Hotel runs a free shuttle service for Pick-up drop
- Old Singapore village like place to visit from the fairy terminal at walking distance. SGD 3 for one way boat trip. Hire bicycle for 4 hours there to visit places there. Sea walk trail is very good.

Cons:
- Away from City if one is required to visit city frequently. It will take around 2 hours to reach city using Bus. No adjoining train station. Cab will charge around SGD 30 to 40 depending on place and traffic conditions.

If you're doing a staycation, consider getting the Club room upgrade. It gives you access to the club lounge, and gives you the option to check in early or check out late by 4 hours. The breakfast spread at the club lounge is a less varied but all the essentials are there. The lounge also has drinks and pastries available through the day.

If you don't mind spending more, you can consider getting the Junior suite upgrade. Beside the room upgrade, the other perks are similar to the club upgrade. The room has an oversized tub for those who really love soaking, a separate standing shower, and even a bidet! However, do note that the TVs in the junior suites are slightly angled away from the bed, so if you have an OCD problem or dislike watching tv at an angle, this is going to be a bother.

We were given the exec lounge room on 662 and once we entered the room it seemed good enough only to realise when we went to the bathroom that I don't think it was cleaned prior to our arrival. There was hair all over the bath and mould on ceiling sealant and looked very dirty.

The main reason I chose this hotel was because I only had a short stop over and was not going to be exploring Singapore. If you have more than one night, I would highly recommend staying in the centre of Singapore city. This hotel is very near the airport but it is not noisy. It is adequate as a functional fairly basic luxury hotel. It has a pool which is always a plus for the jet lagged body.
But the decor is tired with lots of marks and scuffs. Also one of the beds did not appear to be that clean, there was a black hair and marks on the sheets. Fortunately, there were 2 beds so I chose the other one. There were a few 'luxuries' missing which can make the short stay more enjoyable such as absolutely nothing in the fridge despite a list indicating that clearly there are drinks kept in the fridge at times. I didn't explore this as I arrived early and had time to wander down the road and buy my own supplies.
The most annoying omission from my point of view was very limited bathroom supplies with no moisturiser and no face cloth. This meant I had to scrabble around in my luggage to find said items. Ideally, these should be supplied especially as this is not a budget hotel.
Also when making a much- needed cup of tea on arrival, I couldn't find a single teaspoon, just 2 throw- away plastic sticks. Surely a couple of proper teaspoons is not too much to ask for, is it?

This is a good reminder that it is an airport hotel. The pool area is immaculate. The adult pool is shallow. But, the sides are a bit slippery.

On the downside, the airport shuttle, one of the reasons to stay at this property rather than in central Singapore, which is quite close, now runs every 90 minutes. That is crazy. I just missed one on arrival and had to wait. The shuttle bus has no name on the side so we wore stickers with the hotel name and hoped the driver would see us.

The hotel is also located near the jetty where you can take a boat ride to pulau ubin. The hotel provides free shuttle bus that runs on a 90 minute interval to the airport; it's great for those on a transit or a short stopover since the hotel is a 25 minute bus ride from the airport.

Cons: The room I was staying in needed some maintenance. Was given a free upgrade to the deluxe room which I'm thankful for. However, there were parts of the skirting near the door which were falling off and there was also a small hole near the wardrobe area which needs to be patched up.

Unfortunately we just missed the transfer upon arrival so had to get a cab as the next pick up was an hour away (even though there website claimed pickups every 25min!!). We hadn't booked but had enquired about rates earlier in the week by email. The day rates for the room were from 12.00pm - 6.00pm. We arrived at 2.00pm but wanted to leave at 7.00pm. Upon check in, the lady was quite rude, saying there day rates are till 6.00pm only and we would need to pay a full night ( to stay 5 hours) if we wanted to stay till 7.00pm. She also said we should have booked online before arriving. We hadn't booked earlier as we had spoken to reservations by phone and they said there was plenty of availability. After a bit of begging, she check us in at the day rate till 7.00pm, a good outcome after some hesitation.

After this check in drama, our room was perfect for what we wanted, we order lunch and all went to bed. After a few hours sleep, we went to the rooftop pool, which our son loved, as well as plane spotting from the roof.

We booked & prepaid for an exec room & on arriving off an early morning flight from Dubai, we were given room straight away (thank you for that) but it was at the back of the building & the outlook & room itself were unattractive, so we asked to be moved to a sea facing room. We had stayed in one of these rooms previously & also the website states that the exec rooms ""have expansive sea views"", so that is what we wanted!

The access to the executive club lounge just doors away was a boon. My wife and I had access to fruits, snacks and drinks throughout the day, and I could get my coffee fix readily. The lounge was also a place to relax, whether one prefers the open-air terrace or the air-conditioned area.

The Junior Suite was very very nice. Good views of the sea, soft and comfy King bed, spacious, and the super-size bathroom was another room in itself. There are two wash basins, a separate large bathtub and a large shower area. One could almost sleep on the floor, so large was the bathroom. My baby son also had so much playing in the large bathtub.

While the suite was certainly spacious, perhaps some of the white space could be better utilised for further customer comfort. For example, a mini recliner or lounge chair near the windows, a mini shoe cabinet below the mirror just inside the main door. The wall opposite the door (beside the wardrobe) was a little bare as well.

The room wifi works well. Logging in is hassle free, and the data speeds are comfortably fast for surfing the net and playing the occasional game.

Strangely, I could not find any information pertaining to the location and operating hours of the hotel amenities. Wanted to visit the gym the next morning, but there wasn‚Äôt any information sheet/file/dossier in the room.

For the first time I could sleep every night without any problem, good insulation between the rooms and the bed was perfect too.
The breakfast was good and you could find something for everyone, the soup is to die for, a must try.

family,,False,,"Everything was excellent!! We stayed as a family in June 15. This was a different part of Singapore to what we had stayed in before. We normally stay in the city area. We found it to be approx $20-30 cab ride in to the city. We found the hotel to be extremely clean and staffed very well. Staff in all areas were incredibly friendly and always helpful with our requests. Nothing was to difficult or a bother for them. Our room (669) was on the exec floor and very close to the executive level room and the great amenities it had to offer. I would recommend paying the extra for the exec rooms so you can enjoy the amenities such as all day drinks (non-alcoholic) and nibbles and the happy hour (basic alcoholic drinks and nibbly type hot and cold dishes). I would recommend getting to happy hour early though as it can fill up fast and the nibbles can disappear quickly. Every day during our stay, we had a fabulous host in the exec room- I just can not remember his name :( we joked with him about him being at work all the time. He was great. Always cheerful and wearing a lovely smile. Always wanting to help and provide fabulous service. At check out I told him I would write this review, so if your reading this, thank-you for everything during our stay. Your smiling face was a welcome sight every day! We wish you every success in your career!

The food in the hotel is nice, though a little over priced for what it is. There are some amazing eats in the Changi village hawker centre too, which is just a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel. The food is amazing and cheap! With tastes to suit just about everyone. There is also subway too!

The roof top pool was great, though during our stay it was busy with young families, so we only used it once. We didn't patronise the roof top restaurant (adjacent to the pool) so I can't comment on that, but the view is lovely.",2015-06-01,PreCovid,0

This time round, I had stayed as a guest and am pleasantly served well. The gym was the only amenity that I had used during my stay and I'm impressed by it considering I've been to a couple of gyms in hotels locally and overseas. The gym has good equipments and it provides a good stock of water bottles and towels. There's even a shower facility inside the gym.
The room was spacious and well designed and organised however I wasn't too pleased with what I discovered under the bed. I had dropped some coins and it rolled underneath the bed. As I looked under to retrieved my coins, I was rather shock to see the amount of dust gathered underneath it. (it was probably months since it was last cleaned) cos there were dust clumps.
Tedious as it is to move the beds to clean it, it still should be clean regardless as accumulated dust even when hidden can cause respiratory problems and you just won't know which guests in future has them.",2015-06-01,PreCovid,1

I considered the hotel because I wanted getting from the hotel to the airport to be as convenient as possible knowing I will be transporting bulk luggage.The hotel staff were very hospitable and accommodating. I could say this because we arrived at dawn and checked out late at night. Even after you've checked out they let you leave your stuff and have showers with lockers for you to freshen up which you can use for free. The location is great if you want to relax because it's by the beach and the park. There are restaurants all over the place that don't close til 1 or 2AM then open at around 6AM. I really enjoyed my stay here because the main purpose of my trip was to buy a bike and actually ride it so I can test it. They have a huge park near the hotel that you could do loops in. It's about 5-7km per loop.The only downside I believe is that the hotel's location is far away from the city. There are no MRT stations in the area.

The Infinity Sky Pool on the Level 8 is excellent with great view overlooking the sea horizon of Changi. Location is ideal for Staycation for family, as there are many food outlets and good food at the Hawker centre.

The room is clean and pleasant. We really enjoyed the stay here. They even provide bicycle complimentary to guests for an hour.

couple,,False,,"""Second time unlucky"". Picked this hotel hotel as it is close to the airport and Restaurants close by and ideal for a overnight stay on route back to Australia.
Please note shuttle bus does not pick up or deliver to Terminal 3 where Singapore Airline flights come into from Amsterdam and leave from to Australia so taxi is you only option unless you want a long walk with luggage.
Arrived from Amsterdam after a 12 hour flight knowing this hotel has many rooms and it was mid week I had requested an early check in when booking and paying back in November 2014 (7 months ago).
The service desk staff were polite but advised me that as I had booked a certain category of room and that none where available at the moment but if I wanted to pay extra I could update right away. There was no indication of a free upgrade only pay or wait.I do realise the check in time is 2:00pm but had no issue on my previous visit with so many rooms in the hotel.Also not sure if I got an upgrade or what.
I declined the upgrade room payment as most of the facilities included in the upgrade we would not have used. I was advised the room would be ready in about 1 hour so we just sat in the foyer and waited for a room to be cleaned for us so they said..
Once provided (it was an hour) with a room everything was in order in the room. Large comfortable bed,great sheets and pillows,shower in bath and 2 small free bottles of water.
On checking the tea and coffee facilities I found that the hotel had only provided powdered milk and rang room service and asked if I could get some fresh milk for the coffee and was advised it could be provided at a COST OF 6 EUROS. Of course I was taken back by this and promply declined and went up the street to the 7 eleven store and bought a bottle for TWO EUROS. Never before have I been charged for milk at any hotels I have stayed in even here last time I was here so not sure if it has changed owners.. So beware of this if you use the Tea/Coffee making facilities and don't like the creamer powdered milk they provide..
Of course the rating would have been higher but for the few things that spoilt the stay mainly up front but all in all the hotel staff all seem happy to work there.
PS There is a small poolside cafe with very reasonable prices in the complex across the road open to the general public till 8:30pm.which is available to all with great views over the water.

couple,,False,,"Very disappointed, this time. I can't remember how many times I've been here and I've always had a good experience here, such that I often recommend my friends to come here. In fact, I bumped into two of my friends who were staying here at the same time as us!

So, it's with some sadness that I note a drop in service in the club lounge. First, I was in the lounge at about 2:30pm and the air-con was not turned on. The staff explained that the air-con would come on again at 3pm as it was on 'rotation mode', whatever that meant. However, it was still warm and stuffy even at 4pm.

Then, the cold water container was empty, the hot water dispenser also needed refilling, and the cookie jar was empty. No refilling occurred until around 4pm or so when another staff came on duty (changed shift?). Even if there was a change of shift, I'm sure it would not be a Herculean task to do some refills of plain water and some cookies BEFORE handing the duty over.

Next, what made me very unhappy was the hotel not honouring its contract. I had an upgrade to a club room under a membership promotion. It is written in black and white in posters all over the hotel that club room guests have a guaranteed early check-in or late check-out at 4pm. Since I didn't check-in earlier, the usual practice would be to check-out later, as has been the practice so far in all my stays at various Far East hotels the last few years. It was therefore confusing to be told that check-out was the usual 12pm. What I don't understand is how they could give all the other benefits of the club room except the late check-out. And when I asked further, the staff at the reception called Central Reservation and he then told me that late check-out was not included.

I have checked. Nowhere in the email sent to me or the website page to book the accommodation is it stated that early check-in or late check-out is excluded.

To me, a contract is a contract. The promotion states, ""receive a complimentary upgrade to a Club Room with Club benefits."" I accept that a hotel has every right to have exclusions in its promotions, but such exclusions should have been made in writing very clearly. My question now is, would I have encountered such a problem if I had gone to another Far East hotel, or is Village Hotel Changi the problem?

And what is more unbelievable? Late check-outs for club room guests have been around for a few years at least, but the person I spoke to when I called the operator didn't know about such a benefit, and the person I spoke to at the reception had to check the poster to confirm that there was such a benefit.

There is one other unhappy incident but I shall not elaborate further.

Because of this request, they upgraded us to a junior suite. The hotel staff at all times were polite and helpful. The room was spacious but basic maintenance is lacking. Broken tiles and mould under grout should not happen if a maintenance program is in place. The bed was very firm but linens were good. Toiletries included toothbrushes , razor, shoe shine and the usual shampoo etc. The club lounge had an outside area as well. Computers available
for use in the lounge. Staff were a bit eager to start cleaning up and removing drinks before the allocated time of 8pm which was annoying but I saw someone go and ask for a spirit and they happily obliged.

The infinity pool on the 8th floor offers one of the nicest places to laze and look out to the water and watch the planes come it.  Its exciting when a storm is brewing.

A neat place, quite well maintained from my experience. However the same cannot be said with my colleagues so it is more on the room you get. Was put up on the 7th floor, the room was bright, very spacious and provided with good amenities...tea coffee machine....iron and ironing board....mini fridge..toiletries well stocked and refilled....bath robes....slippers..all that you can find in a good hotel. Quality of the bed was something which my colleagues were complaining of...not so much in my case. Sad part was the seating provided...very low class and uncomfortable. The side seating not worth sitting as it not ergonomic nor comfortable. The chair more a low cost office furniture.

The staff is very helpful. Special mention of the front office staff Christina and the mntc staff Rozleun (hope i got the spelling right ). Had a chance to deal with both of them and throughly very helpful in ensuring the guests are taken care of.

The property is situated near the beach so a very quite place. A walk on the board front and the beach is desirable. Good eating joints in and around the place. However if you desire to visit downtown ....so starts your problems. Two options...take the hourly hotel to airport shuttle and then take a MRT from Changi (North East line)...problem frequency of the trains to Changi. Option 2...take the bus 29 from the bus interchange near the hotel to Tampinies and then take a MRT same North East line. Good frequency but the sad part the bus ride will take 30 mins at least add to this another 30 to 40 mins to the center of town. One more option provided by the hotel....a drop to Bugis and Orchard road at 10:30 am every morning only not return. Management could look at providing better connectivity for the guests.

Bfast was good, more trending towards local food with a good mix of regular international selection. Tried the dinner buffet, good choice but the nearby food joints have a much better option and certainly not worth the price.

For the cost of the rooms surely there are better options in the center of the city so it is more a matter of your preference and need to decide on this property. For me surely not a place i would revisit as spending time in traveling did not do any good for my sightseeing.

Overall....very far away from city...but very near to the airport...average hotel for the price better options available in the city. You can also try their Village Changi at Bugis...surely in the middle of all the action.",2015-05-01,PreCovid,0

Beside the transportation issue, the surrounding area is very good. The beach walk, the food court, the tour boat, they are all for a nice and relax vacation in Singapore.
The hotel itself is very good. Room size is big, good for family trip. View is good, either facing to the beach or the golf course. Front desk service is also very good. They did provide me a lot of useful information for my trip this time.

couple,,False,,"Nice hotel close to the airport We have booked the hotel as reviews on a lot of pages seem to be very positive as well as the location to the airport as we were in Singapore for only on night on our way to Bali.

The hotel is a standard 4 star hotel with efficient check in and good service. Rooms are nice and clean and spacious for a couple. The location was a bit further down as expected (20 min by shuttle bus), but the shuttle bus to and from the airport was complimentary. The bus itself is scheduled for every hour starting from 5am to midnight or so, hence it might be a bit inconvenient to have the right time at the airport. Still, it is for free.

Changi itself might be an interesting place, but we did not really have the time to check it out. I‚Äôm sure Singapore city is way more interesting.

All in all, I would recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a layover/ stopover hotel close to the airport as it was cheaper than the Crown Plaza located directly in the airport.

Breakfast was included and the staff were quite friendly, but business like. We asked the if there were any restaurants. and shops nearby. The answer by receptionist was ""10 minutes away by taxi"", so we ate in the hotel (the wine factory. Not a good place, they could not supply any of their advertised special wines. Not tonight sir). Then we found that there were many many restaurants and shops just 1 minute walking away. Unbelievable.

The second time we stayed was 12 May. This time we apparently would not have free breakfast. Why? Who knows.
We did eat dinner just around the corner and it was nice, much nicer than what we had in the hotel.
We stayed in room 736 which had a very very noisy air conditioner. The rooms are very basic, not even a picture on the wall. Yes it is clean enough, but just not a nice place.

It is also not all that conveniently located. Yes there is a shuttle (not all the drivers are friendly. The driver we had this morning13/5/15 at 8am was particularly grouchy) but they only go once an hour. And the ride takes about 17minutes.

Next time we will stay in the hotel at the airport. This maybe dearer it is also much ore convenient.

One more thing about the people in the hotel. We have just come back for. Vietnam where the people in our hotel could not do more for you, and always with a smile. You had a cup of coffee in front of you before you even knew you wanted coffee.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Lovely alternative to downtown Singapore. Other reviewers have covered the hotel's many excellent features so there is no need for me to reiterate them. This review is more for those looking for an alternative to downtown Singapore in a relaxed and small scale environment.
We chose this hotel for a two night stopover because of its proximity to the airport and because we had already visited most of Singapore's tourist attractions on previous trips.
We really enjoyed the ambience and outdoor eating venues of Changi village. We had breakfast at one of the many hawker style places across the road from the hotel for only a few dollars and ate lunch and dinner there too. So much to choose from only a minutes walk from the hotel and there was the bonus of feeling like you were in a completely different, more old style Singapore.
The park and beach were also welcome changes to the hustle and bustle of downtown but there were buses as well as a hotel shuttle for those who wanted to go beyond Changi.We used the Hotel's proximity to take one of the local buses ($1.70) to visit the excellent Changi POW museum which is a long way from Orchard road but only 15 minutes from right outside the hotel and we were helped in this by the staff's knowledge of which bus to catch.

It also has a stunning view, good place to watch the aeroplanes go by.

The cafe where breakfast is served is comfortable albeit small, we kept getting groups of guests hanging near us while they were waiting for a table.
The room looks impressive however our sleep was compromised. The bed was very soft, it was so soft that it was uncomfortable We could hear every word guests passing by outside were saying. There is a glass panel on the wall between the bathroom and the bed. Even with the blinds down, switching on the bathroom light illuminated the bedroom. Didn't help that it was so cold in the room, we kept going to the bathroom and the light woke the one in bed. The coldness in the room was the main issue. It was very cold when we got into the room in the afternoon so we turned off the air conditioning. It got stuffy later so we turned it on at 25 degrees.

The counter at the entrance near the car park was unmanned, so i joined the queue at the check-in counter to enquire. The staff at the counter asked if we'd tried the side road that leads to the back. What side road and what back? I asked a few more questions before finally learning how to get there.

At breakfast, the entrance to the dining hall was also unmanned. We hung around and waited. Then we decided to walk in and a staff

family,,False,,"Just wonderful! The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Shuttle services to and from Changi International Airport is a bonus, considering the location of the hotel is a little bit out of the way from a normal Singapore commute. I have to say, I don't fancy the hotel location despite the plentiful variety of food nearby, it is quite hard to get to. Taxi from nearby like Changi Airport or Pasir Ris cost approximately $10, let alone from the city. Buses would take a little bit more time and you have to know where to take the bus from and the most convenient way is to travel to the airport on shuttle and go downtown from there.

The stay is very pleasant however. Not in the bustling heart of Singapore is a nice change. It is a peaceful and quite place to be. The hotel has a lot of food options in-house. The breakfast is alright, but could be better.

On days where you don't go out and just decide to have a relaxing day in the hotel, if you're lucky, you'd be on the 3rd floor, you'll meet a housekeeper by the name of Maria, she is friendly and generally a great person, she'll engage you in conversations, not small talk, conversation and will make sure your stay is as blissful as can be.

The rooms were fairly basic but comfortable, air-conditioning worked well along with the TV and channel selection appeared to be to a good standing, and the rooms appeared clean and sleep comfort and quality was good.

business,,False,,"Decent Transit Hotel but.... This is actually pretty good for what is essentially a transit hotel; staff are pleasant, the rooms have been renovated recently, adequate restaurant (as ever in Singapore, there is a decent hawker centre a few minutes walk away).

But...unless you've got business at the Loyang Supply Base, I don't really get the point. Unless you arrive between 4:00 - 7:00 pm and catch the rush hour, downtown Singapore is only a 25 minute taxi ride away - because Changi's so big, it took 15 minutes to reach this hotel so you're not saving much time. The advertised shuttle bus only runs once an hour versus a S$15 taxi ride - at 1:00 am, I'm not that keen on saving money.

Yes it's cheap and yes it's near a less visited part of the island but let's be honest, if you've got one night in Singapore, visiting the beaches isn't top of the list for most visitors. And there are other, more interesting places (Botanical Gardens, MacRitchie Reservoir etc) if that's your thing.",2015-04-01,PreCovid,0

**The only downside to this hotel is if you want to use the free shuttle bus from the airport....having done it the first time we remembered what we had to do however the first time it was very stressful (especially after a long haul flight with little sleep!) as there were no clear directions to find the location to catch the bus at the airport.
On arrival at the hotel you will find the staff are friendly & helpful, the rooms are comfortable and very clean. Food is great with good variety. The rooftop pool is great-we spent quite a lot of time there as it was sooo hot!! We upgraded to a club room which was total luxery after a long flight. We also had use of the 'executive' room so drinks & food were available throughout the day/night. The room was fab! Huge bathroom, sea views....definately worth it!
The hotel is close to the beach (with coastal path so easy to walk along), hawker market & plenty of food outlets so there's always something to do/place to go.

,,False,,"Unbelievable poor customer service Dear Mr Walker (General Manager),

This is to bring to your attention over the unbelievably poor customer service that I have received at the Village Hotel Changi on the 3 April 2015. I had make 2 following reservation bookings under my name :
Reservation #1 by using Maybe Baby voucher serial no. 0038-15
Reservation #2 Weekend Saver Promo which is chargeable to me
I fully understand that the check-in time is at 2pm and my specific request of king bed, balcony, high floor, connecting rooms are subject to availability upon check in Village Hotel Changi. I am traveling with 3 adults and 2 young kids and hence I do specific requested for connecting rooms which is my top priority and this request had been reminded to the Reservation dept. (Kim Hong) to take note of it.

Below are the following event logs :

3 April 2015
12.00pm : We have arrived early (estimated 12 noon) on the 3 April 2015 at Village Hotel Changi for check-in and was attended by the Duty Manager, Ms Halinah. We were informed that the 2 x rooms that were reserved under my name were not ready for check-in and were told specifically to come back at 2pm for my check-in instead. This was confirmed NOT ONCE but TWICE by the Duty Manager, Ms Halinah on the 2pm check-in. I did mentioned that there were specific request for the rooms under my reservations and she hereby did confirmed that these requests are already in the system which she is aware of and she will call me back once both rooms are ready. We need 2 x connecting rooms as I have a helper coming along with me, hence is 3 adults and 2 kids, at least with connecting rooms, the helper and 2 kids can share the king bed and are within my sight. Since both rooms are not ready, my family proceed for lunch as we have 2 young kids traveling with us.

12.56pm : I have received a phone call from Village Hotel Changi. I was told and given a choice that there are available connecting 2 x rooms (w/o balcony) at this moment (12.56pm) and for connecting 2 x rooms (w/ balcony) will only be available at 3pm (instead of 2pm). I therefore reverted back that I will stick to the connecting 2 x rooms (w/ balcony) and do not mind waiting for the additional 1 hour and check-in at 3pm.

2.01pm : I have received another phone call from Village Hotel Changi. I was informed by Duty Manager, Ms Halinah that there are NO MORE connecting rooms available for me. We ended our lunch in a rush and went back to the hotel to check.

2.15pm : Both me and my spouse went to the check-in counter and spoke with the Duty Manager, Ms Halinah. We were informed that the connecting rooms were no longer available, to our upmost surprise! What were left are rooms next to each other but not connecting internally. And the reason why our reservations were messed up is due to the current guest that did not check out as there flights are in the night time (or any other hidden reasons that were not told to us?). We have rejected an offer by upgrading to the suite offer by Duty Manager, Ms Halinah, simply that the suite can only accommodate 4 pax and we have 3 adults and 2 kids with us. The space and privacy will be a constraint as well as the biggest suite you have is only at 51 sqm.

In order to solve Duty Manager, Ms Halinah's problem of finding us the appropriate rooms (which is 100% impossible), we decided to let go and cancel our reservations. It was a very upsetting situation where we spent our precious time arguing with someone who is not meticulous enough to handle our reservations and try to solve the guest-to-be problems.

Before we ended our conversation, we specifically requested that the Duty Manager, Ms Halinah to revert back to us on what can be done for our future stays (e.g. In June 2015 period) as our voucher would have expired by then. FYI, the voucher was not returned to us as well.

7 April 2015
Today is the 7 April 2015, it has been 4 days since then, I did not receive any phone calls nor emails from any representative from Village Hotel Changi. I have been waiting patiently and unfortunately my patience is wearing out.

Village Hotel Changi has a total of 380 rooms with 40 rooms that has connecting doors and my request for connecting 2 x rooms were not managed and planned with care. Planning for 2 out of 40 connecting rooms is do-able.
Lack of communications and wrong information given to me during my communications with staff from Village Hotel Changi.
There is no follow up despite the mistake caused by the Village Hotel Changi. Or this mistake was solely caused by myself?

I have itinerary plans for my kids on the 3 April 2015, full of activities and food hunt which was unfortunately cancelled due to the negligence of Village Hotel Changi. We went home with heavy hearts and both kids were crying. We could have went for a short getaway trip out of Singapore but instead choose to remain in Singapore to explore the Changi area which I think its good for the kids to visit too.

I sincerely hope that Mr Walker would pay attention to my email and call me back (I do not wish to speak to other representative other than yourself) or you can have the option to ignore this email and deleted it away but minimally at the very least, do let me know so that I do not have to keep on waiting.

Yours sincerely,",2015-04-01,PreCovid,1

The rooms are spacious though there was once an ANTS problem by the window but they were prompt to shift our room & get it all sorted out. The poolside deck is great for a quiet evening of lounging. The food scene next to the Hotel is equally amazing. Whether it's the legendary Nasi Lemak to be had at Mizzy's or International Nasi Lemak at the Changi Village Hawker Centre or it's the famous Chicken Chop Hor Fun ... This place is a foodie's paradise. The Beach is a short 5 minute walk away & the Changi Coastal Boardwalk is amazing in the evenings... For food that is a bit more on the pricey but yummy side - you can walk over to Jubilee or the Coastal Settlement for some amazing Western snacks or for some quiet teatime chit chat (gets crowded at dinner times)...! Changi Village is peaceful & exactly the kind of place where you can have a quiet time away from the hustle & bustle of Singapore's CBD.

I had arranged to surprise my wife. Ain from the Front Office Team went beyond the call of duty; she personally purchased a rose and an anniversary balloon, as well as arranged for swan-flower d√©cor in the room with complimentary cake. It was an excellent start to our anniversary staycation.

At the breakfast buffet the next day, the staff on duty (I did not manage to get her name) took the initiative to ask if we would like a baby chair when she saw us with our son. Furthermore, she also provided baby cutlery without us asking.

We also enjoyed the rooftop infinity pool, where we had a thoroughly memorable time playing with our son.

The hotel rooms may seem slightly dated but these are small concessions considering its strengths in other areas; namely excellent staff service, a rooftop infinity pool, a rustic and peaceful location with access to various outdoor activities and food options.

couple,,False,,"Excellent for overnight stay near Changi airport The hotel is located in Changi, between 10 and 25 minutes from the airport, depending on traffic - a peaceful, quiet, and green place, ideal if you don't want to go into the centre of Singapore for an overnight stay. One small gripe: the free airport shuttle operates hourly which can mean wasting a lot of time if you allow for the worst traffic situation, so a better frequency would make a difference.
Check-in was efficient and courteous. The room was quite compact but comfortable and more than adequate. The double bed was actually twin beds pushed together, but comfy with a nice duvet. There was plenty of hanging and shelf space, a safe, a TV, and a kettle. The lighting controls were a bit confusing, though, and the window didn't open (but the aircon was very good). The bathroom had a large window into the bedroom, and the tub had a monsoon and also a hand held shower. The bottom of the bath tub was chipped, but otherwise no problem. It was nice to have plenty of room for our toiletries in the bathroom.
The hotels has a lovely rooftop pool and several restaurants. There are, however, lots of eating places nearby, the whole spectrum from hawker stalls, to simple Indian open air restaurants, Chinese places with a wide ranging menu, and a quite smart Italian restaurant.

Once entered the room and closed the door, i discovered that tge floor wasn't really cleaned properly as underneath the wardrobe, i can see dusts and small lil hair (God forbid what hair is that) on the floor. I even tried to wipe it with a tissue n black dirt came out.

The air con had condensation with water droplets around it but since it didn't drip, we didn't really complained but then at night it got warmer so we had to open the balcony and rely on the cool wind from outside.

Wasn't really feeling well so i extended my stay for one more night. The operator/front desk lady by the name of Lin was very helpful with my extension and explained to me on the benefits of the club floor which we didn't really use. as we are local and were here for a staycation, we don't really carry big bags with us. So i put my small paperbag filled with my work shoe in the wardrobe on top of the safe. Informed Lin as well on the air conditioner.

However, when we came back that evening, i noticed that my paperbag was touched as my small guardian bag was placed outside and my shoes was touched and they even placed it the wrong way with the wrapper not tidy up. I got a lil bit upset and felt insecure of what the room attendant did. Maybe they thought its rubbish but im sure upon knowing of the extension, they could have placed it back to the original place. But they failed to do so. The air conditioner works well and it got cooler so its good to know that its been fixed.

Unfortunately for the 2days that we stayed over, we are not able to use the pool as there was a solemnization ceremony going on. I think its unfair for those people to have ceremony at the pool side as it can dampened other guests mood who stayed here for a relaxation weekend only to be ""left out"" not able to use the pool.

Upon check out, i was surprised that my bill was with taxes instead of nett price. I'm sure the staff should be aware of what type of reservation should be a nett price but she kept on arguing that its the reservation who keyed in with taxes and asked me to forward the booking confirmation to her.

business,,False,,"Excellent housekeeping, but bad soundproof I had a 13-night stay for my business trip at the hotel. The hotel location is far from city, but with a 20-minute ride to airport it suited my need. Breakfast was ok; laundry was efficient and sent back before 6pm everyday. The infinity pool on 8/F was an incredible one, that attracted me to swim there almost everyday in that 2 weeks.

Shuttle service to Bugis/Orchard was convenient, although it runs only once a day. The airport shuttle that runs hourly between 5am and 1am was also okay. Just on the day of my departure, there was a group of around 20 from China taking the airport shuttle. They almost took every seat of the shuttle and I was just lucky by chance to be able to get on. Missing that one I would have missed my flight. I suggest the shuttle should be arranged by registration. For a large party like that they should arrange their own transport instead, or the hotel to arrange a bigger coach that fits other hotel guests.

The most problematic issue is that, the hotel takes too many school children tour. Everyday there are groups of children checking in and out. They run around and make so much noise along the corridor. I was waken up by their noise at 7am and can't sleep back anymore. Either the soundproof of the room was too poor, or the hotel should think twice in taking on these inconsiderate groups. The teachers should be reminded to brief their kids to behave themselves. To stop the noise, reception staff has arranged to put a towel outside my room door to block the gap. Ironically it worked quite well - at least I can't hear the conversations outside as clearly as previously.

Having said that, I would like to thank Ms Maria de Castro, the housekeeping lady who took care of my room all the time. She greeted me by name every time she saw me; and helped to fold my clothes which I left messy on the sofa. Her excellent service attitude has made my stay a comfortable one.

We could not take the tour at the time, because we had to catch our cruise ship which was departing that evening. But the manager, Fahmy, told us that when the cruise ship visited Singapore again in a few days, we could take the tour then, and save money by not having to book a shore excursion through the cruise line.
When the cruise ship swung back to Singapore, we were able to do this. Fahmy was correct. The tour operator honored the voucher, even though it was a few days later. We really enjoyed the hop-on, hop-off tour, especially since it was free!
Also, the free breakfast was amazing. We tried foods we'd never had before.

The bed is super comfortable and the air conditioning is great. There is kettle and cups for teas and coffee provided.

I prefer the club room as when there is an offer for daily breakfast, I could eat at the lounge (only for club rooms and above) and the sea view is perfect with the sea breeze. I been to the gym and small towels and bottles of water was provided. The roof top pool is kinda small but the sea view is great and you can sun tan there. There is another pool near the Salt Water Cafe which is ok except that the people who are dining will be able to see you swimming.

I like this hotel as it is near to the Changi Beach Park where I can go for a stroll and enjoy the sea breeze.

The hotel didn't let us down by upgrading us to an executive room with a balcony. We were extremely pleased with our room as it's clean, spacious and contemporary. The room felt warm and cosy. The king sized bed was comfortable. The wifi in our room were very strong. We felt as if we were home because of the comfortable room setting and welcoming hotel staff. They gave us a lot of attention but checking if everything was okay and whether we had a pleasant stay. We felt most happy when we could enjoy all the facilities in the executive lounge on the 6th floor. The Happy Hour from 6pm to 8pm was one of the highlights of our stay. We really enjoyed the complimentary food and drinks there. Breakfast was very nice too as it has good variety. We both were extremely happy with our stay at the Village Hotel.

It's a good place to stay away from the busy city. I had very good experiences during my first two times here with my partner, so I was pretty disappointed when it came to this 3rd time. I came here with my family this time round as they have never experienced staycation.

Firstly, though, I have to commend the hotel for acceding to my request of having adjacent rooms. However, both rooms had different standards when compared side by side. (Well, they are connecting rooms. Comparing is inevitable.)

Let's start with my room.
- There was an unfinished piece of Christmas cookie in the cabinet below the television.
- The toilet paper in the toilet was at about half its original roll. Maybe the hotel was being eco-friendly. I'm not saying that the unfinished roll has to be thrown away, though. I may be ignorant on this point because I'm not sure if other hotels do likewise, but I just felt it was rather unsightly.
- My room didn't have any room slippers. Well, I initially thought that the slippers weren't provided until I found a pair in my parents' room.

Parents' room:
- There was only one bath robe while my room had two.

Well,as mentioned, I'm not sure why both rooms had different standards. I suspect room service was probably not thorough.

While the rooms disappointed me, the service didn't. Service at the check-in counter was good and staff was friendly. My family wanted to drink in our rooms to but we didn't have a bottle opener. When my Dad went to the bar to ask for help to open the bottle, the lady at the bar gladly opened it for us. I also remember another request that was quickly answered - my mom had requested for a softer pillow and in less than 5 minutes, she was given one.

In December, having enjoyed my stay the previous month, I decided to book the executive club room once again, but this time for my elderly parents and myself.

This time around, I was badly disappointed by what you would call an ""executive club room"". One room, with a king sized bed, a roll-away bed and not much else. Even worse, the shower facilities were incorporated together with the bath and where's the living room? The table along side my bed had a chair that could not be utilized because the extra bed was beside it. Needless to say, because the bed could not be easily moved aside, I was unable to draw the curtains.

There are limited car lots to this place if you are guests attending a wedding. While the hotel is not exactly directly responsible, the integrity of its valet staff leaves much to be desired. At press time my case is still being investigated (there was a theft case involving the hotel valets. )

The problem that I had there was about the cleaning lady. On arrival, as I entered the room, I noticed that the cleaning lady was accidentally left the broom in the room. Not a major issue though....

Starting from emailing enquiries right up to the point of Checking in and out of the hotel, the experience has been a great experience. Staff was efficient and prompt in handling enquiries whether online and offline. There is free wifi and signal is good.

Upon checking in, we were pleasantly surprised that we have been upgraded to a Junior Suite. That was the start of the great experience at the hotel. The room is super clean and neat and the extra bed for the kids was also very comfortable. Teh kids loved the room so much so that they refused to leave for lunch.

If you are intending to have a chill and relax kind of staycation, this is the place. The surrounding area is very peaceful and quiet. Great eating places like 89.7 eating house and Changi Village food center is within minutes away. There are also great cafes nearby like The Finest Tea Shop, Peloton and Chock Full of Beans. So there's no reason to stay cooped up in the hotel as good food is nearby.

The most loved part of the hotel is the rooftop swimming pool. It just looks so gorgeous especially at night. Great place to just soak in the jacuzzi pool or just the pool itself to watch the view or airplanes overhead. When we were there, there were guests having a poolside tea. So it was good to soak in the atmosphere too.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,1

It's great that the hotel did their very best to accede to your request eventhough it can be quite difficult over the weekend with high occupancy. My 4 kids enjoyed their stay and this certainly won't be last time.

Location is great with fact that there is so much local food to savor.

I have no issues with the services there only facilities that need improvement.

1) Hope the pool has a heater when the temperature gets cold. Need to maintain the cleanliness. Toilets at near the pool can be better maintained

2) Install water spray tube next to the toilet bowls. Guests will be appreciative.

I was surprised by the size, the brightness, the cleanliness and the quietness of the hotel, despite the fact thet it is near Changi airport. More than that, it is located right opposite the beach and the park of Changi. I walked along the beach for more than an hour. It was relaxing.

Not far from this hotel is a very large choice of eating places with very good and tasty food at very good prices.

we first learnt about village hotel changi from a local tv show. it's said to be ""the"" hotel to go to if you'd like to escape from the hustle and bustle of the typical singapore lifestyle. we must say we quite agree.

the hotel is located at a quiet end of singapore, and it's just a few minutes shuttle ride (which the hotel conveniently provides hourly) to the airport.

our room was good enough. although small, everything else about the room was fine. we especially liked the ""bathroom window"" concept.

we really loved the rooftop pool too. you could watch planes landing and taking off every few minutes, it was really nice.

also, there's this area on the 6th floor that's quite underused in our opinion. it had comfortable chairs, benches and tables under big umbrellas, and it had a little pond too, and our then 2 year old son really enjoyed feeding the fishes. (you could buy fish food at the lobby.)

just along and across the quiet, peaceful street, there're plenty of local eateries and little neighbourhood shops. changi beach is also within walking distance.

if you're having a quick stopover in singapore or if you're living in singapore and looking to take a break within the country, you might want to consider village hotel changi. we enjoyed our staycation here.",2014-01-01,PreCovid,1

The hotel is currently undergoing a freshen up and facelift to so it's looking really good.

However, this last visit was really something special. Firstly, despite it being almost a year since we were there, we were remembered by the reception staff and welcomed so nicely! It really felt like we were home:-)
Half an hour later in my room, I realised I had left my netbook computer in the taxi from the cruise terminal...and that was when the lads on reception proved just how good they are at what they do. Fazuan and Fahni swung into action, and despite no taxi receipt and only a vague memory of the taxi colour on my part, within 30 minutes they had tracked it down. Two hours later, there was a knock on the door and there was Fazuan proudly handing it to me, beaming from ear to ear! Even better. the taxi driver had been paid and the fare cost simply put on my bill. I could not be more grateful to these fabulous lads!

No review would be complete without mentioning bellboy Chandru. His beaming smile and always upbeat and friendly greeting when we crossed paths, just made our day. What an asset these staff are, they make you feel just so valued and welcome!

It's a great place to stay if you intend to explore Pulau Ubin and still live in comfort. Other places you can explore nearby are the Changi Boardwalk, Changi Beach and the Prison Museum. Not to mention, it was also reasonably priced and included complimentary breakfast, wifi and 1-hr bicycle rental so we booked it for two nights.

Prior to us checking in, I sent a few emails to enquire about some things and they were promptly responded to within 2 days. Likewise, our check-in process was fuss free and the staff was very polite to us. In fact, the staff were polite throughout our stay.
The rooms were of a good size and relatively clean. The sheets had a couple of black ink marks on them so they were not absolutely clean but at least there weren't any icky stains nor hair. I like how the temperature in the room can be controlled and we slept well.
The complimentary breakfast spread from the Saltwater Cafe was really good and we had great breakfasts on both mornings. I was glad that some of the dishes were changed to provide more variety. The restaurant staff was polite as well.

However, they should note two points. 1) We were not told upon checking in that there would be painting works on the facade of the hotel. There was a small notice at the lift about it but as the lift was available immediately when we got to the lobby, we did not have the chance to read it. This bothered us because we were shocked to see two men on the fake balcony of our room when we were jolted out of a nap. Thankfully we were properly dressed and all. Also, there was a lady next to us when we were checking in and she asked about the shuttle service which she had requested for and did not turn up. The Concierge (not counter-reception staff) who came to tend to her over the matter was unapologetic, loud and interrupted her many times when she had problems expressing herself. He did not apologise at all and even said, ""Never mind! We will pay you your taxi fare. How much is it?"" I was ticked off by the whole thing and did not think it was a matter of money at all.

He also recommended us the Suite or Club room upgrade, which we decided to take (Club) as it was good value for money. Effectively I only topped up around $10 per pax for daily buffet breakfast for 4 of us. The housekeeping / maintenance were also great! They were prompt to attend to our calls for extra bath towels and an accidentally locked room safe which couldn't be opened. 2ndly, variety of activities has also improved! Now there is a koi pond for koi feeding to have relaxing enjoyment for the family and free 1 hour rental from Changi Cycling Services (5-7 min walk fr hotel).

But once you managed to get to the lobby of the hotel, it will be the start of your great stay.

First off, the hotel room is clean and and is rather spacious. The design is vibrant as well, making the room atmosphere lively. Toilet is clean as well, though the water heater takes a while to heat the water up, so take note when taking showers. Finally the walls between the rooms might be a little thin, as sometimes we could hear soft sounds from the next rooms. Overall its a pleasant stay in the rooms.

Next are the facilities. The hotel provides the usual facilities, that is, breakfast buffet, swimming pools...etc. To top it off, the hotel does provide coupons for you to rent bicycle to ride around for free for an hour, its a nice touch as the surrounding area and scenery is worth a ride. Lastly I would want to highlight there is a Italian restaurant on the top floor that serves very nice food, definitely check it out when having a stay there.

As the area is rather remote, there are no shopping malls nearby. What you can find around are cafes, bicycle shops, beaches, and sports clubs. There is also a ferry station that offers boat trip to Pulau Ubin island or Desaru (passport required) just across the hotel, so there are quite a number of places to go to when staying there.

Lastly would be the staff service, time and again, we were impressed by the staff attitude, and their actions definitely go beyond what they are required to do. The speed is fast too, ensuring that the request gets fulfilled in time or even before it. I will have to say that this is definitely 1 of the main attraction of the hotel, as you will not have to worry about their service, in terms of speed and quality.

It would have been useful to be told that given the day of travelling I'd had.  Once I got to the room I immediately wished that I could stay another day.

business,3.0,True,Neutral,"Good - if you need to be out near Changi. I found myself staying at the Changi as a result of attending a conference in late October. The hotel was recommended by the conference organisers and this involved a promotional rate. The hotel is perfectly acceptable - I would rate it as a solid 3.5 star property.

Highlights for me were the rooftop pool. This is very special with great views across the channel to Ketam Island. I was fortunate enough to be there to witness a spectacular passing tropical storm. You can also see the aircraft landing at Changi airport, although it is about a 10-15min drive between them.

The rooms are comfortable and well laid out. There was complimentary wi-fi which was fast and easy to connect to. The bathrooms had rain shower heads and there were quality toiletries and amenities.

I also really like the area. It is a quiet area of Singapore with a fantastic hawker centre with incredible food. Cheap and great quality. There are also some specialty restaurants along the main road which were very popular.

The downsides were the general weary look and tired feeling that the place has. Also my first room had the smell of smoke which was odd as the hotel claims to 100% smoke free. That was bad for the first night as I could not be relocated due to a full house, however the Duty Manager arranged for a room change the next day and this was conducted professionally. All my luggage was moved for me while I was out and the Duty Manager left me a small gift.

Overall it is a good quality property that is perfectly acceptable. Would I stay again? Yes, if I needed to be out that way and I got a discounted rate. It is not a hotel for the tourist as it is too far from the main attractions of Singapore.",2014-10-01,PreCovid,0
business,,False,,"Great service. Nothing is too much trouble Stayed here for 3 months and 2 months on two separate trips. They went out of their way to help me out whenever it was required. The laundry service is great. The breakfast is very good and there is a 7-11 in the lobby of the hotel. There is a gym and steam room and a fantastic executive lounge with all the complimentary bits and pieces you would expect. All the bases covered.

The hotel has a nice little bar that is very cheap by Singapore standards. There is a passable Japanese restaurant and a nice little european style brasserie in the main lobby and on the roof there is a slightly overpriced Italian restaurant and a swimming pool. My advice is to use the Italian restaurant to buy a beer and enjoy the view out to Palau Ubin and over the straits.

For short term travellers, this is close to the airport, and there is a 'Hawker Center' or traditional Singaporean food market within 3 mins walk from the hotel. Changi Village has quite a diverse nightlife. There is a Halal food court, Chinese, Malay and Indian food cooked fresh in abundance and even a subway and some western style bars if you are THAT homesick!

family,,False,,"Disappointing stay We came to stay at this hotel for 3days 2nights as a whole family with baby and elderly. I was disappointed that when we checked in at 2+pm, the rooms were not ready. I had requested earlier for 2rooms with king sized bed and 1room with twin size bed when I called the hotel to make room reservations. Clearly, the request was not clearly communicated and taken down. The front desk then gave us one room first for the whole group of 6 of us, then 1hour later the other two rooms were finally ready. However, the front desk officer tried to mke things alittle better and provide us with late check out at 2pm.

Honestly, the rooms are alittle dusty, could be cleaner. Overall the food are quite all right, except the variety is limited. We had two days of buffet breakfast, one buffet lunch and one buffet dinner. It was disappointing that the lunch and dinner had rather similar dishes and desserts. Regretted having more than one meal in the same restaurant. Furthermore, there was a sign saying that the kitchen was managed by celebrity chef so we expected more variey and higher quality food. I don't know why there are always really big housefly when we had our breakfast and lunch which was really annoying.

I tried the spa in the hotel. I regretted trying out the spa as the service was quite bad. I called to make an appointment, then was told that their schedule was very busy due to weekend, so I was told to be on waiting list. So I decided to book an 1 hour massage at 9.30pm, thinking they should be less busy at that time. The spa close at 11pm daily. When I arrive at the spa, I was thinking which type of massage to choose as stated in the shop and pamphlet I found in the room. I was told that I was unable to choose as most massage therapists have left at 9.30pm! The massage lady just told me she will make me comfortable. I almost wanted to leave the Stella wellness centre. I mean if you decided to close at 11pm then shouldn't there be a few people working till then? When I booked the appointment, they should have told me that there will be limited massage choice or just ask me what type of massage I wish to have. Bad spa service! Will not step inside again.

Lastly, I need to mention during one of the morning at 7am. We realize there was no electricity! We woke up with no lights or aircon. It was really annoying! Because I need to boil the water to prepare milk for my baby and I can't! So I have a crying baby for 45minutes before the electricity returned.

So basically I will not want to return this hotel anymore.",2014-11-01,PreCovid,1

We came in about 15 mins before they started and food was already out but was scolded when we tried to take some food. When we did get to eat, we enjoyed the selection of food during the cocktail hour. It was the saving grace of the Club Lounge.

The rooftop garden/swimming pool has a great view of the sea and it iis my favourite place to chill and get some sun. If you are in for some exercise/trekking around, the trek route is within 5mins walking distance. You could get bike rental nearby too in under 10dollars, and there will even be a complimentary bike ride coupon that comes with your room booking. I reccommend cycling in the late afternoon and stopping under the shade to appreaciate nature.

I was pleased to see that they had correctly arranged for my requests of 2 connecting rooms and a baby cot in one. The hotel is convenient for transit travellers being close to the airport and well connected by shuttle or cab. I noticed some flight crews checking in too. I tried the Japanese restaurant which was good, and the spa which was okay. Breakfast was nicely done and everything seemed family friendly.

solo,,False,,"Good hotel, but great Club Lounge I stayed three nights at this hotel and was generally satisfied with the amenities and service, although this hotel is starting to show signs of age. The room I was given was an upgrade to a Junior Suite on the fourth floor since I'd booked at another of the group's hotels a week prior. A nice touch. Although on arrival, several things were out of place or unsatisfactory. Firstly, there was no shower curtain, and then the aircon seemed a tad weak. The wardrobe light wouldn't switch off unless I fully OPENED the door. The bed was not up to standard, either: too hard, although they semi-remedied it by putting on a thin soft mattress topper. I also didn't like the overly big mirror at the dressing table although that's just personal taste.
As for the breakfasts on the ground floor restaurant; not impressed at all. Service was curt from some staff members and on one morning the male omelette chef seemed not to understand any English at all, although the lady that usually cooked there was much better and more efficient. I asked for a four egg omelette, but what I got was a two egg and two fried eggs plonked next to it. The other ""hot"" selections were not up to much, either. The sausages were fried long in advance and not kept hot at all. The other offerings were not that much better. TOmato sauce and chilli sauce was presented in two huge bowls from which you were expected to help yourself! Too difficult to offer bottles of sauces? Or are you just trying to skimp?
Thankfully though, since I was booked into a junior suite, I had access to the Club Lounge, which was a treat, both in terms of service and friendliness. The night before I left, I asked the Club Lounge manageress, Sheda Ismail, if omelettes could be made in the Lounge kitchen to which she replied that they couldn't, but she could arrange for one to be made in the kitchen especially for me! I told her that I'd like to have breakfast quite early, and she said she'd arrange it for me, although she only started work a little later. To my delight, when I arrived, there she was, with my lovely omelette. I was really impressed, as she'd made the effort to come in early to satisfy the needs of ONE guest! Now THAT'S what I call service!
I have a suggestion for the management: Spring for an extra employee in your Club Lounge kitchen who'd be able to make eggs to order in the Lounge kitchen. I had just come from the Philippines and stayed at a hotel where I'd booked a Business Class room with executive lounge and they did indeed have a dedicated chef to make on-order eggs for the hotel guests booked into their Business Class rooms and higher. If you do this, it'll set you apart from the others.
Once again, this is a pretty good hotel, but a great Club Lounge experience thanks to Sheda. I'll be back!

Our room was clean and modern, like the rest of the hotel.  It's very close to Changi Beach and the ferry to the island, and just across the road is a market with a group of shops to meet just about any need. The pharmacy was especially helpful in meeting the challenges of a head cold I brought with me and after taking what they recommended I felt much better. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly so when we wanted to see the Changi Museum and the island of Ubin Pulau they advised us about the best ways to get there and answered all our other questions. The hotel has a bar and a Japanese restaurant on the ground level, both of which we tried. The bar's prices seemed a bit high but we soon found that in Singapore drinking alcohol is expensive wherever you are.The restaurant was okay, although there was a slight mixup in our order that took a while to resolve.

The service level is good but can be improved.

As we had an extra night this time, we went over to Ubin Pulau in a ferry. The boats leave just over the road from the hotel, you don't have to wait long either. As it was a Sunday a lot of locals were going there for the day as well and they couldn't have been friendlier. Had a lovely walk until it rained. Again the locals went out of their way to talk to us.

couple,,False,,"Not one of those for light sleeper Hello everyone
Thank you for reading this.
This is my own non biased review on this hotel. i have 5 basic criteria to rate for a good staycation
1. Service - Jovvy front desk officer was friendly and provided very good service upon my check in. So checking in was a good experience. But parking was a nightmare. There were perpetually no car park available and I have to queue for 1/2 hour to get one. So drivers beware if you are having a staycation on long weekend or public holiday as you are going to experience high volumes of guest from weddings & church goers. So I say service was 3/5 good after all

2. F&B - since carpark is a nightmare, I decided to have buffet dinner in the hotel then. Saltwater international buffet & poolside bbq. First, do not have uber higher expectation, basically forget about whatever international buffet experience u had in a hotel before. This is mind blowing ! Basically it is just a local hawker fare ( like straits kitchen @ Hyatt hotel ) but more scaled down. Relax & cosy environment . They do dedicate a small corner at the buffet line for salads, cold cuts n soup but it's not great! The other mind blowing section is the poolside bbq. Do not be fooled by the pictures or advertisement. It is basically a small charcoal bbq pit beside the pool and food available for bbq was only - Taiwanese sausage, chicken chop, lamp chop, steak, sambas dory, sotong. It's not like what you think it is. So I will rate food 3/5 average good.

3. Cleanliness, not bad the hotel is clean as an establishment. But u dun stay in the lobby right. Let's go straight to the room. I have choosen to stay in the eexecutive room. The room Is simple but fully equipped. However the disappointing part is the shower area. There is only a bathtub. So you shower in the bathtub too. And to make the matter worst, they provide a cheap shower curtain which does not provide any help. After you shower the whole toilet floor will be wet. So if you are prone to fall, this is very Importsnt to note. It is not easy to climb in & out of a bathtub especially when it's wet. And the floor is wet & slippery after u shower. So generally after a shower, there ain't such thing as cleanliness anymore :) so I rate it 3/5 , average

4. Comfort, oh the bed was good enough but dun expect some high quality Simmons like Conrad etc. the pillow they provide was a total nightmare. It's just too too soft. And it disturb the quality of the sleep. ( pillow are individual preference ). Sound proofing of the room is bad. Yes, when was the last time you stayed in a hotel and you can hear everything, from the traffic outside, people walking in the corridor, guest in your next room shifting furniture, kids playing and screaming and also hotel staff moving around with their trolley and not forgetting airplanes occasionally. And I dun mind white noises. This is audible. Meaning you can hear them like u are part of it. The reason for this is, the gap in the door is big, so lights and sounds basically travel in. And the curtain although should be a 100% blackout drape, the gap at the bottom is so wide enough that sunlight can shine in and it brighten the room. So ... Yeah .. Defeat the purpose. So I givr 2/5 - poorly design room

5. Location - so you decided to stay at changi, then dun complain. Location is good because it's out of town. And it's near to the changi park. It is just a great way for you to relax and enjoy the nature cycling Lile that. If you want shopping? Wrong choice ok. So location depend on what you want. But of cause food choices are aplenty with the famous nasi lemak ( I would say many famous nasi lemak ) hehee .... So I give this unbiased 5/5

Overall this hotel I will give 3/5. It does fit in the category of a 3 star hotel. Not fancy not fantastic but ok for a not so high expectation staycation. And if you are not having a budget problem I suppose u might wanna reconsider this .",2014-10-01,PreCovid,1

couple,,False,,"Enjoyable and value-for-money staycation! We wanted a short getaway to celebrate our special occasion and decided to have a staycation at Village Hotel Changi, and we were happy with our choice!

The good:
Service: Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The counter staff were all smiles and very pleasant and friendly, making us feel very welcomed. So were the housekeeping staff, who would greet us heartily whenever we met :) Throughout our stay, we also saw many instances of staff serving with a smile, and being helpful in general, so this was really thumbs-up!

The room: We had a deluxe room at the top floor, which was quite spacious for 2, with access to a small balcony, with a village view. Actually, I think it was more of a forest view, which was great! We also got to watch the planes pass by :) We liked that the floor was not carpeted. The room came with basic amenities, but if you need something that is not available in the room, try calling. E.g. Housekeeping sent up disposable shaver quickly when we called to request for one. If you wish for your mini bar to be stocked up, just dial the extension indicated in front of the cupboard where the mini fridge was located... Though it is probably cheaper to stock up at the convenience stores less than 5 minutes walk away from the hotel. Oh, and we loved the rain shower! Bed seemed rather hard initially, but we soon got used to the firmness and slept very well each night. There were a couple of times where the noise from airplanes that flew closer by were a bit louder and a particular guest slammed his/her door loudly, but these did not impact our sleep. We either had very considerate neighbours, or the walls were good enough.

The pool: There were 2 pools, and we only tried the one at the roof top. It was very relaxing and peaceful! You could laze in the water to watch the planes, or enjoy the lovely sea view. Pool was clean when we visited on a Friday afternoon, and mostly used by couples.

The club lounge: We had complimentary access to the club lounge between 6 to 8pm (thank you for making our special day even more special!), to enjoy cocktails and canapes (cold cuts, cheese, salad, and a small selection of hot items). While we didn't drink, there were non-alcoholic drinks available (Nespresso, fruit juices, soft drinks, etc). We enjoyed the ambience and the food! Very relaxing and quiet, even when it was full of guests. I think for full club access, you can have breakfast here too, among other perks. There is also free access to the computers and some reading materials are available as well.

The massage: We were initially disappointed that there was no spa treatment available, but the full body massage was good and affordable, and we felt refreshed after the massage! Hotel guests had an additional 10% discount. Showering facilities were available within the massage room.

Location: While this hotel is definitely far from the city centre, it is certainly a good base for us to go explore Pulau Ubin. It was a very short walk to the ferry terminal, and it was great to return to the hotel to chill out after a hot and sunny day out to Pulau Ubin. There were also plenty of food options, both halal and non-halal, within short walking distance, from the food centre to the various coffeeshops, cafes, restaurants, and pubs. We had deliberately pick somewhere further away from the city, and were glad to be away from the crowds.

Shuttle service: We took the once-a-day, 1-way transfer to Village Hotel Bugis after we checked out, and it took about 30 minutes. The same mini bus would also continue on to Far East Plaza (Orchard area). We just had to inform the concierge earlier and indicate if where we want to stop at. There were also hourly 2-way transfer between hotel and Changi airport, and a few other once-a-day shuttles, do check out the hotel website for details.

The not-so-good:

While the room was clean in general, the balcony was not, and we noticed the edges of the curtains were dirty while we were opening the balcony... Also, there was only 1 small chair in the room, with the other being a single-seater sofa, so we were not quite sure how we could chill at the balcony. One of the bathrobes was also torn, but we didn't really have to use them, so it was not an issue for us.

In all, we think that it was very value-for-money, and we really enjoyed our stay here. While some things could have been better, we think that the service was really good and we would definitely consider coming back here again.",2014-09-01,PreCovid,1

couple,,False,,"Great Weekend Get-A-Way! Hi all,
This review is much belated, but here goes:

I recently celebrated my 11th anniversary and also my wife's birthday at Changi Village Hotel, from 29th Aug to 31st.
The check in was promptly settled in 10min, the room given has a view of the sea, as requested.

When we got in the room, there was a welcome card from the General Manager, and Asst. Manager with a complimentary jar of cookies.

At the club lounge, the service manager Ms Sneda made a point to welcome us by name, and offered to help us order the drinks.

After we came back from the complimentary evening cocktail, we had a nice surprise, a birthday cake and a bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary.

The room also came with a complimentary ride on the City Explorer at Singapore a Flyer. We opted for the orange route, which brought us on a round trip around the city and orchard area.

There was also a complimentary1hr cycling experience which we did not have time to enjoy.

The bedding and pillows are soft and fluffy, giving us a well rested 2 nights!

Breakfast at the Saltwater cafe was nice with a good variety of continental menu and asian menu. One suggestion for the salad bar was to have olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the healthy conscious.

This hotel is most suited for travelers looking for an idyllic get-a-way.

To The staff at CVH who made our stay comfortable and a memorable anniversary, Thank You and Keep up the good work!",2014-08-01,PreCovid,0

After dinning there twice, I would like to compliment it that the foods and services is excellent. Most of the food that I have taken, most of it is delicious. Special mentioned is the laksa (MUST try), durian paste pudding, mutton rendang, satay and its gravy, teh-tarik, and soups.

Their service staffs is very generous with their smile and attentive. Restaurant Manager Mr Marco So and his team earned my most appreciation and compliment. Keep up the excellent work, so do your kitchen as well.

Because, I will be back and I expect at least (if not better) the same foods and services that I use to enjoy.

Cheers!!!",2014-09-01,PreCovid,1
solo,,False,,"Outstanding service A stay downtown during a two-day stopover was tempting, but in the end I opted for the peace, convenience and comfort of Village Hotel Changi.

After 30hr in airports and on planes, all this traveller wanted to do en route from the US to Australia was get to the hotel to have a shower, a much-needed rest and some food later.

Arriving at T3 meant jumping on the monorail to T2 to inform the person at the Ground Transport Desk on the arrivals level I needed to catch the hourly hotel shuttle, due at 30min past the hour.

It took about 20min to get from the airport to the hotel and checkin was a breeze because there was no queue. It can take a while when there are crowds arriving or departing.

I was impressed when Fahmi, at the counter to my right and who checked me in last year, leaned over and quietly and warmly welcomed me back.

The refurbished room I had looked good and had great sea views, but it's the standard of service at the hotel that is outstanding, from the friendly room cleaners and reception staff, to the guys on the transport desk at the front of the hotel.

Ann Lim was brilliant in her welcome and attentiveness at breakfast in the Executive Club Lounge and the next day at reception after I found myself locked out before my late checkout.

Jyzryl at the transport desk impressed with his dedication to his work and was helpful in suggesting places to visit.

Yes, the hotel is about 30-40min from the city, so it might be out of the way for those in Singapore to see the sights or shop 'til they drop, but there is a one-way shuttle bus to Scotts Rd at 10.30am each day and taxis are readily available.

I love the relaxed atmosphere of Changi village and felt very safe walking to the hawker centre and restaurants nearby late at night and equally safe coming back on bus 29 from Tampines at night.

At the end of my stay I left for home feeling like I had just spent 2 days recovering from jet lag in a lovely, relaxing part of the island with good friends who are passionate about what they do.

Village Hotel Changi staff obviously love their job and go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them. Thank you.",2014-09-01,PreCovid,0

We dined A La Carte at lunch time and I enjoyed a beautifully cooked salmon fillet with lemon and butter sauce.  My son had the  beef burger which was homemade and very flavoursome.  In the afternoon I had the most relaxing and restorative massage from a true professional.  The staff are really helpful and friendly - nothing is too much trouble.

The only downside is that the hotel is really far from the city center, about half an hour in taxi (45 minutes by public transportation).

couple,,False,,"Nice stopover hotel w local village  My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights. 1st night we didn't end up getting in until around 2:00am since our flight landed around 12:30. Immigration was very breezy that time of night which was nice and shuttle bus was right there to pick us up. It was about 15-20 min ride to the hotel where our check in was very easy and quick. I would definitely suggest upgrading to the club room. It was very nice to have breakfast and cocktails and snacks available in that club room along w magazines and computers. The room was moderate. Everything you need without the fancy decor but the bathroom does have a glass shower door so there are no secrets. After breakfast (continental breakfast) which is totally pork free! Which is great for people who don't eat pork, we decided to explore and seriously everything was Within a 5 min walk to hotel. A bunch of local (really good) restaurants and then the hawkers area which is where more good local foods and little shops are (no clothes unfortunately) and fresh drinks for cheap! Then we walked along the chenghi boardwalk and eventually decided to take the ferry to wherever it took us. It ended up being a very nice ferry right (2.50 pp each way) to this small island w some food areas and a million bike vendors. We rode a tandem bike through the trails which were very nice near the water. Got a fresh coconut water and then headed back to chenghi for the rest of our day. Overall. The experience was nice and all staff were very friendly. The pool was actually very nice and you could sit at the edge of the infinitely pool and watch the airplanes fly by.",2014-09-01,PreCovid,0
family,,False,,"Relaxing staycation Had a one night weekend stay to celebrate hubby's birthday. We were upgraded to a bigger room along with lounge excess and a complimentary extra bed which was a pleasant surprise. Checked in and checked out was fast and efficient. We manage to check in at about 12pm and was given a late check out at 2pm. Staff are generally efficient and the cleaning ladies and gentlemen we met along the corridors greeted us with a wide smile. Bed and pillows are comfortable.

The room was relatively big and definitely clean. Bathroom had both a bathtub and shower facilities. I didn't like the shampoo and shower gel that were provided as they seem ""lumpy"" though both lather well. we were given a high floor (6 floor), our room which is right at the end, had no view except for the mouldy outer walls and a small section of foliage.

We hailed the airport shuttle bus which operates hourly which is very convenient.

Info Nuggets:

- Be sure to request for complimentary one hour bicycle rental coupons at the reception. The shop is located right next to the hawker centre. We rented two double bicycles and had a good time cycling along the changi beach. The beach was relatively quiet and much cleaner than East Coast beach. It has an excellent playground which reminded me of those rope structures which you need to climb in order to play. Perfect beach to view the airplanes flying over your head.

- The executive lounge. It was pleasant, with lots of juices, great coffee, magazines, yogurt (in the morning), soft drinks, fruits and canapes and very nice to spend your day in on a lazy afternoon.

-the rooftop pool on the 8th floor. wonderful view of the islands and the aircrafts flying to and fro. I find it amazing that the airplanes seem so close to us. While the view might not be comparable to that as MBS, it offers a tranquility and serenity that you would not be able to find in the city. Excellent bathroom and changing facilities as well. Would be good to clean the glass at the ledge as it appears tad musty. There are not enough lounge chairs around thus we had to keep an eye out each time someone gets up in order to find a place to put our things. Passageway is rather narrow, thus perhaps instead of lounge chairs, benches or normal chairs might be better since it would save space. Towels are replenished if it runs out.

-location of hotel. As the hotel is situated near changi village, the place famous for local food, we had a good time exploring the food options and all at affordable prices. The satay,carrot cake and stuffed taupok are a must try. Oh, there is this place opposite the hotel, that sells excellent mango and durian crepes. We saw this little cafe ""chock full of beans"" that seems crowded everytime we passed by, should be a good place to try.

Because there are no shopping centres that are within walking distance, it enables my family to actually spend more time in the hotel, exploring the place which sets a relaxing and pleasant mood for all of us. We had staycations at hotels in the city before, each time we rushed to go shopping at the malls, use the swimming pool, rushed out somemore to see other shops, which means that we didn't spend much time at the hotel. But at Changi Village Hotel, the entire holiday atmosphere had been set from the time you arrived. As my daughter commented, the whole place seems so rustic and quaint, like time has stopped.

-While the rooms have been refurbished, the outer facade and some of the walls still look dated and tired. Perhaps a new coat of paint will solve the problem. I find it a pity to have great rooms marred by the appearance of mouldy walls.

-Koi pond on the 6th floor. Great place to relax, with the lounge chairs available, and to feed the koi at $2 nett per feed. When we went down for breakfast at 9.30am, there was a dead koi floating. When we checked out, the dead koi was still there. hmmm......

-Breakfast was adequate. An array of food from cereals, cheese, bread, yogurt to nasi lemak, fried kway teow, mini cupcakes, vadai, vegetable curry, hash brown, baked beans, sausages, grilled tomatoes and of course the obligatory egg station. Ms Bathmat who was manning the station was friendly and efficient as she churned out pans of omelettes, scrambled eggs and sunny side up. Food was topped up relatively fast. I love the fact that tea/coffee was served in mugs than in cups and saucer as somehow it ended to the ""village"" feel.

-Creek pool at first floor. While my kids wanted to try swimming in this pool as the sides are transparent which is a good concept, i was extremely hesitant as entry and exit to this pool seems to be via the saltwater cafe and I didn't like the idea of dripping through the cafe to get to the hotel room, though there are changing facilities available. Plus I also didn't like the idea of swimming in full view of cafe guests, quite a strange feel. Which could explains why I didn't see any guests during the duration of my stay.

I would highly recommend this place if you are seeking a peaceful sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Changi village is a sleepy little town with its quirks and hordes of people out for the good food. So yes, do give this hotel a try out if you are in the area.",2014-09-01,PreCovid,1

The room was not a bitter pill - It was really, really spacious and clean. Our room came with a balcony and it was amazing. We love the balcony given!
Every guest loves a beautiful balcony. However, we were a tad discouraged to use the arm chair given in the hotel room as it looks quite moldy. In addition, only one arm chair was given.
The toilet was clean with small window and a bath tub facing the television.
I would still say the room, in overall, was not a disappointment to us.

After checking the amenities of the room, we then proceeded to redeem the bikes (we booked a Weekend Cycle and Stay package) and it was quick.
Despite the quick service, we were not given the directions with regards to the venue of the bike shop (we were not familiar with the area) and have to prompt the staff for directions.
Headed off to the directions but were lost a few times before we found it. (The bike shop was hidden in the neighborhood under HDB blocks)

The evening cocktails at the Executive lounge was marvelous. We were treated excellently - the staff were attentive and friendly. Very customer-oriented. We were also given chocolates and apricots with a personalized letter to bring back to our room.

This review is for our stay in June, but posted now because Tripadvisor doesn‚Äôt allow another review of the same place within three months (I posted another review in May).

My stay at Village Hotel Changi this time was with my family. The manager, Mr Kent Law, was very patient and friendly in arranging a package for us before that.

I won‚Äôt repeat what I mentioned in my earlier review of this hotel but will highlight some additional points from the most recent stay.

Good:

- As usual, I met friendly and helpful staff. This is important as I have encountered staff from other hotels who were not very patient of children.

- Having two, connecting, rooms was a very good arrangement as it allowed enough space for the family to move around, as well as hang around for snacks and chit-chat when we wanted to avoid the afternoon heat. This hotel does not have a family room. Even if it does, staying in a family room is not a very good idea for my family of five as having enough space for young children to run around in is very important. Imagine lots of running and lots of shouting in a small room!

- The breakfast was also very good with a wide selection, and offers a variety in our food choices i.e. buffet in the morning in the hotel, then go outside the hotel for something else for lunch and dinner.

-The hotel provides a very good base for exploring the surrounding areas like Pulau Ubin, Changi Coastal Walk, Changi Beach etc. with children. Go out, get some sun, get dirty, and the hotel is just nearby to go back to to wash up and take a rest.

- There was this young, bespectacled, man at the caf√© during breakfast whom I must commend who was very attentive and who noticed I had taken a wrong spoon and quickly ran up to me and gave me the correct one. This is the kind of proactive service I appreciate.

- The auntie who was doing the cleaning on our floor was very friendly and greeted us with the widest smile, and who engaged my children in conversation. Again, this makes you feel happy to stay at the hotel.

- All in all, I recommend this hotel for a staycation with your family. The quiet surroundings are actually a plus point as it gives you the opportunity to catch up with your family. Going somewhere else more ‚Äòhappening‚Äô actually distracts you with the many activities and you may end up not spending quality time with your loved ones. The koi pond area is also a very nice place for the family to sit around amidst greenery to chit-chat.

Not-so-good:

- Perhaps I misunderstood, but I remembered the hotel communicated to me over the phone that I would be given rooms facing the golf course. But at check-in, I saw the staff who checked us in change our room numbers from 7xx to 6xx, and the rooms were facing the centre of the hotel complex (where the koi pond is). Those rooms had no privacy because anyone inside that area could look into our rooms, and so we had to keep the curtains drawn almost all the time which I didn‚Äôt like as I preferred to have natural sunlight in the room as much as possible. Naturally, as I had no written proof of the communication, I couldn‚Äôt really do anything about it, especially when the staff said they were the best rooms available. :o(

- There was re-painting of the steps at the top floor, beside the swimming pool. Isn‚Äôt it common sense to put up signs to warn that painting is going on? Well, there wasn‚Äôt, and more than one guest stepped on the wet paint and walked around with stained soles. That wasn‚Äôt nice for the guy who had to re-paint, and for guests who would find it difficult to wash away paint from their soles.

- The air-conditioning in our rooms could not be controlled. The temperatures were cold no matter how we turned the settings. It was still fine during the day because of the hot day, but it was a little too cold during the night and I had to turn off the air-conditioning, which means that it became a bit stuffy after a while. This was not the case during my stay in May, though.

Tips:

- After staying here a few times, I find that the sea-facing rooms tend to be in a worse-off condition, maybe because they are more popular and hence more used and worn-down. If views are not a must, go for non-sea-facing rooms. I found mine better maintained than the sea-facing rooms I had in previous stays.

- If you are staying here with your family, try not to squeeze in an extra bed if you can help it. Putting in an extra bed only makes it the room very cramped with little walking space. We took two rooms and skipped the extra bed (even though we were offered one without extra charge), and had a good time playing Monopoly on the floor. That wouldn‚Äôt have been possible with an extra bed taking up the space.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,1
business,,False,,"Big room, cozy bed, spacious bathroom Stayed here for 1 night before my early flight on the next day out of Changi.

The check in process is fast and flawless but I was the only one who was checking in during that night, I could not really judge if it is that fast generally.

Unfortunately there is no MRT to this hotel, it is either you take the free shuttle from the airport to hotel, or you can take the cab. The distance from the hotel to the airport departure terminal is not really near, the shuttle took like 20 minutes without traffic, and the cab should be much faster but with the traffic that evening, it took around 25 minutes. The cab driver is a bit moody as well so I guess it is a bad day for him. And the free shuttle provided is a bit disappointing. I missed up to 2 shuttles during the evening due to i) cannot find the place to the bus, ii) congested lift.

The room is quite big and there is ironing facilities provided. I made good use of it to iron out my crumpled shirts after long trip around various spots in SG. The WIFI internet is given complimentary if you are a guest in the hotel. So far it allows up to 3 device for login, I did not try with 4 devices though. The bed is quite comfy but the aircond can be quite cold if you set it to anything below 23 C. The bathroom comes with a see through window. And the warm water can gets quite warm after a while.

It is just a short stay so I can't provide any more input apart from these.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,0

solo,,False,,"Not worth going out of your way for this I've rated this on the basis of being a place for a stop-over when using the airport.  On the basis of being a hotel to stay in if you are visiting Changi Village or the Eastern side of Singapore, it might deserve a slightly higher score.Changi Village Hotel is very near Changi Airport, but on the opposite side of the airport from the passenger terminals, so the journey isn't really very much shorter than the trip to some of the downtown hotels.  For that reason, it's hard to recommend it as a stop-over hotel.  There is a free shuttle bus, but this runs only hourly (""first come, first served"") and I failed to find out where you can pick it up at the airport, or what time it leaves the terminals (it only serves terminals 1 and 2).  Instead I took a taxi ($16 in light traffic).Check-in seemed to go very slowly, with quite a queue of people building up (even though we didn't all arrive at once on the shuttle bus) . Check-out also seemed quite a bureaucratic process for the reception staff to follow.  My room was on the second floor, which was in the middle of being renovated - quite literally in the middle of a construction zone, with temporary cladding on the floor, plastic sheeting blocking out the atrium, etc.  I've rated ""cleanliness"" quite high for the rest of the hotel -- this corridor was a big exception.  Happily, my room was one which had been renovated already.  It was nicely arranged, with a good range of facilities (and good free wifi), including a huge TV with a reasonable range of channels on offer.  I was surprised to see that the minibar price for beer was $7++, less than the $10++ charged in the hotel bar.  But, regrettably, the minibar was empty.  Hmm.  The most disappointing feature of the hotel was the sleep quality - most essential in a stop-over hotel.  The hotel can't control the behaviour of other guests, but there was an immense amount of banging around and loud voices in the corridor at around midnight - noise exacerbated by the construction zone cladding taking the place of normal carpet, I suppose.  I would think that at least one of the episodes of noise was due to a large tour group.   And the room walls didn't seem particularly thick, either, so I could hear conversation and TV in the neighbouring room long after midnight.  I don't know if they similarly enjoyed my choice of morning TV at 6am.  I've stopped over in Singapore many times, and contemplated the Changi Village Hotel quite a few times.   Know I know what it's like, I can't say I'll be rushing back.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,0

However, the hotel met all our needs. The staff were always friendly and the service was of a high standard. The hotel room was well appointed and additional services and benefits were provided by paying an additional fee such as breakfast, free cocktails and snacks during happy hour, a later check out, airport shuttle service and admission to the Ambassador Lounge at Changi International Airport.

We were more delighted to be given a room on the 7th floor (requested for high floor, checked!) which had a closed balcony with full glass windows overlooking the sea. The view was really nice. We were also greeted with complimentary tidbits (nuts, that old school round biscuits with icing and dried apple). Room was neat and clean. The bathroom was very clean too. Bed was comfy and the pillows were fluffy! The infinity pool at the roof offers a breathtaking view and enjoyable for plane watching while taking a dip.

couple,,False,,"A nice stop-over hotel We chose this hotel as a base whist travelling between Hong Kong, Myanmar and Indonesia as its location was convenient. Both check-in and out were fast and efficient. There is a courtesy bus which was very welcome as the taxi queues were dreadful at Changi airport, over an hours wait. Whist the rooms are fairly basic they are comfortable and there is a large range of bathroom necessities that are useful when having overnight stays. We chose to take the Executive option and were impressed by the food and service in the private lounge conveniently located on the same floor as our room. The cocktails are a choice of spirits; gin, vodka etc and some fairly decent wine, either red or white. The wording 'open bar' more be appropriate to the options. The breakfast was very basic, but fitted with our needs as we were leaving early for onward connections. The only real complaint we have is concerning the roof top pool on the eighth floor. Firstly, there were no  noticeable pool attendants and as such the pool area was messy. Secondly, a lot of unsupervised children were running riot, ignoring all the safety notices and making it hard for other guests to enjoy the pool.Thirdly, most of the sunbeds around the pool were taken but with no one actually sitting or lying on them and we had to make do with one of the broken ones. Needless to say we did not stay long and it was a shame because we were looking forward to a relaxing swim and snooze after a long days journey at the start of our holiday. We didn't even bother to visit the pool again after that experience.

family,,False,,"HUGE variety of food nearby I'm a local Singaporean, and I can safely say that this hotel is the BEST place to be for trying authentic local food, at local prices.

Changi Village is a popular food haunt among locals. There is a huge variety of food just two minutes walk from the hotel, in the form of a huge hawker centre (100+ stalls) and at least two coffee shops. When in Singapore, eat as the locals eat, and you won't go wrong. There is no other hotel in Singapore that is so close to authentic Singaporean food.

This hotel is also very near the airport, so it's great for travellers who are only visiting for a couple of days. If you need to go to town, just get a taxi (affordable!).

As for the hotel itself, it was recently renovated so it's very swanky and new. This hotel is a reputable one, it has been here in Changi Village for at least 30 years. Everything was shiny and clean, I am completely satisfied. I checked the bed very carefully for bedbugs, and I am glad to report that this hotel has no sign of them.

However, the buffet breakfast spread pales in comparison to the huge variety of food available at the hawker centres, where prices start from $2.50. You should eat out instead of at the hotel. That said, the hotel restaurant on the 8th floor (La Cantina in Venezia) is famous among locals for their signature crabmeat linguine (linguine al granchio), it's hands down best in Singapore.

The roof top pool is right on the approach runway for Changi Airport so you sit back in the pool with cocktail in hand whilst watching planes land from all corners of the globe.

family,,False,,"Good place for a relaxing getaway As a couple with two young children, my husband and I find that it's not easy to get a hotel room big enough to accommodate all of us at a price that won't break the bank. Given the ages of our children (2 and 6) it just doesn't make sense to split up and get 2 rooms. Naturally, we were pleased to find a one-night stay package in the Executive Suite (51 sq meters) that included breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children, an extra bed for our 6-year-old and evening cocktails for the parents at the Executive Lounge (children are not allowed there). We stayed there on August 9.

We were very pleased with the Executive Suite. There were plenty of windows to let natural light in. The beds (the king-sized one in the bedroom and the additional single bed) were comfortable. There were two TV sets, one in the living room and one in the bedroom, and two mini fridges, one a minibar and the other empty so guests could fill it with their own choice of drinks and snacks bought outside the the hotel. If there was anything to gripe about, it would be the fact that the the hot water tap (not labeled, we had to figure it out) for the bath tub wasn't working so well; the water that came out was not hot enough, tepid at best. The sink didn't have hot water either, which was not a big deal until I woke up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and found myself freezing when I washed my hands.

The great thing about staying at this hotel is its proximity to Changi Village. It's a five-minute walk away and there are plenty of bars and eateries serving a wide variety of cuisines, from local to Italian to Moroccan. We ordered room service for lunch and the bill came up to SGD$69.51 for 3 items - a cheeseburger, fish and chips and a fruit platter. In contrast, our dinner at Supper Club, a large halal-certified food court just down the road, set us back by only $36. We ordered 4 bowls of noodles, 2 servings of dim sum (dumplings), a plate of Chinese rojak and drinks. I would strongly recommend that guests venture out to Changi Village for meals.

There is one other feature of this hotel that stands out, and that is the rooftop swimming pool on the 8th floor. It has an unbeatable view of the sea and of Pulau Ubin (Ubin Island) across it, and you get to watch planes fly low as they make their landing at Changi Airport, which is nearby (but not too near). My kids and I loved our time at the pool.

The only thing that I was unhappy about was the way breakfast was managed. Breakfast is served from 6.30-10.30 and we were there a little after 9. A line of guests waiting to be seated had already formed so it was closer to 9.30 when we finally got a table. We weren't early birds but there was at least an hour to go before breakfast service ended, yet some of the entrees had run out, like the pancakes, the char kway teow (fried noodles), nasi lemak (coconut milk rice). So what could one have? Eggs (naturally, there was a line at the egg station), salad, beef sausage, toast and pastries, rice congee and fruit (banana, pineapple, rock melon, banana, apple, orange). Then there were entrees that I felt didn't belong in a breakfast menu, like teriyaki fish and vegetable curry. What were the guests supposed to eat those with? There was no plain or fried rice which usually complements those dishes. Basically, I didn't mind that there wasn't a wide variety of food being served, but if you don't have variety, you have to make sure that you have quantity because guests are going to come back for the same foods more often. Anyway, everything got topped up by 10, except the nasi lemak, but maybe it was a case of many guests going for it so fast that by the time I looked inside the rice pot it was gone again. Perhaps the hotel was short-staffed that day and couldn't handle the demand.

Overall, a stay at Village Hotel Changi is value for money for families, especially if you can get the Executive Suite at a discounted rate (SGD$300 off the rack rate in our case). It's a 4-star hotel not aspiring to be 5-star, but you get comfort, convenience, decent service, and a pool with an amazing view.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,1

It's a bit of a mixed feeling with this place but I'll start with the great stuff first. Staff were all friendly and polite. The check-in was easy. The rooftop pool was awesome albeit there were not enough deck chairs around as the relaxing area is a little tight. Towels were well stocked though so that was great. The executive lounge was a nice place to retreat to everytime we returned from warm outdoor activities.  One of the staff at the lounge - Sheida was wonderfully warm and always made us feel so welcomed whenever we return to retreat at the lounge.  Food at the lounge was of great quality ! The location is perfect for long strolls along Changi broadwalk and literally a stone throw away from bustling Changi village and the Pulau Ubin ferry terminal ! Wifi worked very well all over. As for the not so great stuff, we booked a Junior Suite based on images from Agoda. The images showed us a large bathroom with a bidet for the Junior Suite. It was exactly what we were looking for.  When we turned up, we were so disappointed to find that not only it doesn't have a bidet but that the bathroom was a totally different one as shown on Agoda !  In fact, as per according to Agoda images displayed, the real life bathroom of the Junior Suite turns out to be the deluxe / club room bathroom size. Giving them the benefit of doubt, we went down to the reception with our ipad to double check if it was indeed the junior suite that has been allocated to us. The reception was a little confused, made some phone calls and then got back to us with an answer saying ""The rooms has undergone renovations recently that's why it looked different from Agoda images"" and when we asked which rooms has the bidet and she said ""Only the Royal suite has a bidet"" !!! It was totally unconvincing. Firstly - it was clear to me that the rooms has not undergone any recent renovations. If anything, the room and bathroom looked a little old and tired due to age but that's fine with us as long as they kept it clean which it was. Secondly - I don't think there are any ""Royal suite""  per se, if they did then it surely have not been advertised to the public.  Lastly - I think they need to remove the large Junior Suite bathroom image on Agoda which is misleading and apparently available only to the ""Royal Suite"". However saying all that, I would still rate this hotel as a fairly good hotel for all it's other amenities. The room interior could do with an overhaul.

We had some air-conditioner leakage on one of the days there but the problem was solved promptly by the staff.Two thumbs up to all hotel staff and their efficiency.
Food is abundance around the area.Convenience shop and Guardian pharmacy is all within 5-8 minutes walk across the street.Public buses to the nearest town (Tampines) also available,its bus stop is just in front of the hotel.
We walked along the Changi Point Coastal Walk in yhe evening and it was lovely especially during sunset.If you have enough time to explore more,you can take a boat ride to a nearby island called Pulau Ubin and experience a different side of Singapore.

Toilet is very big with a very big bathtub. Showers r separate. Easy to bath kids. The executive lounge privilege is also very near for those who stay in suites at level 6. It's great that they allow us to take back some finger food to our room since kids below 12 are not allowed in the lounge.

solo,,False,,"Green Singapore with real Jungle 10 minutes away For a different, less touristy or commercial, much greener experience of Singapore, try Changi ""village"". The village is just a tree -lined main road, and the Village Hotel is just a standard relatively modern (and recently up-dated) hotel catering for business people and tourists mainly in transit. It is close to the airport 15 minutes by taxi and 15 to 20 SIN dollars. By Singapore standards it is economically priced, the restaurant is fine and there are lots of cheap local eateries within 300 yards. The modernised rooms have wood flooring, Scandinavian style slightly utilitarian bed and bathrooms, and very good external sound insulation, necessary due to the proximity of the airport. Internal sound insulation is not so good. We love the stylish rooftop pool, and there is a second garden pool.
However it is the location that marks it out, very convenient for airport stopovers, and right on a green bit of coast with an attractive coastal path. It is also only 300 yards from a pedestrian ferry to the jungle covered Pulau Ubin island. The ferry goes all day, quaintly only when enough passengers have turned up, and only costs 2.50 SIN dollars for a single trip lasting about 10 minutes. On arrival you can hire bikes ( 8 dollars) or take a taxi to the Chet Jawa wetlands reserve, which has a well maintained board walk. With luck and patience you may see monkeys, wild pigs, hornbills,herons, White bellied sea eagles, Brahminy kites, and a host of smaller birds and waders. There is also an old colonial cottage with fireplace, said to be the last open fireplace in Singapore. Particularly if you want to see some local bird life this is a must-do trip, but just biking thro the ujungle is an adventure in itself. We have been twice mid week when it is very quiet, but judging from the number of bikes for hire it could be busy at weekends.",2014-07-01,PreCovid,0

The gym is well equiped. The breakfast buffet offered a wide choice of delicious food. What is especially nice about the place is its location in one of the least densely populated areas in Singapore. A short walk from the hotel, guests can enjoy the laid back atmosphere of Changi Village with its cafes and food stalls. Also, Changi Coastal Walk and the beach clubs and cafes near it are well worth a visit.

I'd say that this property is quite conveniently located from the beach, and also a stone throw away from the famous Changi Village Food Center, which is great for those wanting local food for very reasonable price.

There is also a complimentary shuttle bus that runs every hour between Changi Airport and the hotel, which made traveling to and fro the airport convenient for us.

Unfortunately we did not get the chance to try out the buffet breakfast as well as the roof top swimming pool as we had less than 12 hours at the hotel.

We booked a superior room as we were only staying for the night. It is a very basic room though with adequate amenities. Housekeeping have also done a good job in keeping the room clean and tidy. The air-condition, however, was way too cold despite us having turned down to a higher temperature. Despite it being too cold for me to get quality sleep that night, the bed is still considered very comfortable.

The concierge outside the hotel gave us the wrong direction to the food center. We did not report this issue as we think it's minor and that we managed to figure out the way by ourselves. Front desks were very helpful and polite during check-in and check-out, which we really appreciate.

Toilet is attached with bath tub and see through window which can be closed too by the blinds. Requested for baby crib and was send within few minutes. Also requested for housekeeper to clear up the bin which is full of my 3 children soiled diapers and within 5 minutes, the housekeeper came. My 3 children love the infinity pool the most as it oversee the plane landing. It will be great if there's kids activity in the hotel.

As it was a weekend, the hotel was visibly crowded and there was a relatively long queue for check in. I waited for 45 minutes before I could check in and I think that the hotel could look into their check in processes during peak periods to speed up the check in.

We were given a room on the 7th floor with a nice view of the straits. I was glad that my request for a baby cot was seen to straight away and I must commend the hotel on their efficiency despite the high occupancy rate because it mattered a lot to me that the needs of my child were taken care of.

The hotel is located in the vicinity of many eateries including the famous changi village hawker centre. You can also choose to explore pulau ubin or venture toward the changi beach park to watch the sunrise and planes landing and taking off at changi airport.

Despite this being my 5th time at the hotel, I was still impressed by the level of service that was provided. I have to commend Habibah(Staff who attended to me at check in) for being patient to handle the requests of each guests and also some complains due to the long check in. Our requests for extra towels were also seen to promptly and our check out was expedited.

Room was spacious, rain shower was good and bed was comfortable. Bathrobes were available for use. We stayed at the 7th floor, hence the roof top pool was only one floor up. Enjoyed the roof top pool greatly, however it was slightly dark to navigate around the pool at night. It would be better if there are more lights.

Breakfast had a decent selection, nicely mix with American and oriental selections. We requested for a late check out and was served by Jonathan on the phone. He was polite and gave us a late check out till 2pm without hesitation.

Overall, the stay was great. Even though the location was slightly out of the way, we enjoyed the serenity of the location. The Changi Village Hawker Centre and Chock Full of Beans cafe (nice latte art) nearby are worth visiting! The staff was ever friendly and hospitable which keeps the property lively.

couple,,False,,"Nice and comfortable transit hotel We stayed at Changi Village for one night and found it to be absolutely fine. It's a huge older style hotel but has been nicely looked after.

Our room was nice and comfortable but a little bit 'plastic' looking (fake plastic wood flooring, fake leather purple couch), not the sort of place I would book for a week-long stay but fine for an overnight stop.

The rooftop pool was lovely, it was great to have a dip in the morning before check out. We really enjoyed staying in the Changi area also, I've not spent time there before, we had fun wandering around the beach park and the markets and we went to the prison museum also. The hotel is centrally located right next door to lots of food vendors.

The only criticism was the cleanliness. The room was fine, but the bathroom definitely had not been cleaned properly - we could tell the guest who stayed in our room before us had medium length black hair, because it was on the wall of the shower, in the toilet bowl and on the bathroom floor! We arrived at midnight and were too tired to complain.

Reception check-in: be prepared for a longer queue time at peak hours. Buffet breakfast at Saltwater cafe is mediocre though clean. Service is fair enough here.

Charming place as a whole - plenty of shops and eateries around, many of which are halal as well. Palau Ubin is just a boat ride away. The terminal is only a 3-5 mins walk from the hotel.

However, the volcano in Indonesia changed that! Our return flight to Darwin was delayed a further three days but we nevertheless enjoyed our stay.

The hotel is in the Changi Village district which is very pleasant with lots of restaurants and bars along the street, so you don't need to go far for a very decent and cheap meal. Try the masala butter chicken at 89.7 just 200m from the hotel.

The hotel itself is very good and the staff are excellent. It can take a while at reception when it gets busy so give yourself plenty of time to check out. There is a complimentary bus shuttle to/from the airport regularly throughout the day, and there is one shuttle service into the city, although taxi fares in Singapore are very cheap compared to Australia. The hotel also provides complimentary bike hire for one hour and the shoreline across the bridge at the ferry terminal just opposite the hotel is ideal for biking.

She conscientiously and meticulously answered all my queries promptly during the planning of the event. On the day itself, she made a point to drop by to say hi and make sure that everything went well.

I must say the various departments co-ordinated well to execute the event - the function room for the tea ceremony was set up properly well in advance, and the solemnization venue too.

The only minor hiccup was the food for the vegetarian guests (it was supposed to be plated, but we were informed at the last minute that it was not the case, but it was eventually plated in the end). The beef steak in the buffet dinner was also a tad too tough and dry. Other than that, I've no major complaints.

We stayed back late chit-chatting with a table of friends (well after other guests have gone home), and saw only 1 staff (Naz) clearing the tables and chairs. Well, kudos to him too - it's not easy clearing the venue all by himself so late into the night.",2014-05-01,PreCovid,1

I only took the wrong turn once trying to find my room and eventually worked out to open the door using a electronic key system I hadn't encouted before. Once into the room it was very well presented, even if it was showing its age. The bathroom was also well presented. The room temperture was easy to control.
The only critisium of the room would be that the shower head is set at a height forcing anyone using it to lift it out of its socket - its obviously a water saving measure as you can't shower with both hands free unless you are only about a foot tall.
Food
Room service: The one asian style dish I ordered was very generous in size as well as being to my liking.
Breakfast is truely a mulicultural affair and they do it well - all western and eastern meals catered for. Only disappointment was that it would have been nice to be able to order a proper coffee. However, the filtered coffee isn't too bad as a subsitute.

couple,,False,,"A mixture of good and downright shoddy We stayed here twice as a one night stopover on outward and return flights to and from New Zealand. The outward stay in January was fine... A very helpful young man on reception. The room service meal was OK except for the white wine! They just don't understand that Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay are not even similar. Anyway, that is a cultural thing and my wife settled for water.

The second stay in February was poor. This one was booked through a large booking agent whereas the first stay was booked direct with the hotel. I have long suspected that you are more likely to get good treatment by booking direct and this experience increases my suspicion.

On arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a double bed room from a twin bed room which was neither here nor there to us because we just wanted some soft drinks or beer then shower then sleep. But, there was no minibar even though that was part of the booking specification. The porter called housekeeping and we were told that mini bar would be sorted in 5 mins. After 20 mins, housekeeping called to say that this room does not have a minibar so, they can' t help. In the meantime we noticed that the bed linen was soiled and had not been changed..shoddy! Furthermore, there was one tea bag and only 2 coffee sachets. I went back to reception with these complaints and the young lady was more concerned with defending our 'upgrade' than with resolving the problem. I showed her our booking docs showing that we had
booked a room with a minibar and she then gave us one of their Club rooms. This room(665) had a minibar and had been serviced but otherwise, was indistinguishable from the first room(423). The wash basin was cracked and clearly had been for some time and the basin was very slow to drain. The minibar had 2packets of nuts which were 4 weeks beyond their' set before' date. Hardly what you would expect in a more expensive 'Club' room.
Good points are that it is very convenient as an airport stopover, the airport shuttle service works well and the breakfast was OK.

business,,False,,"Good hotel, great service I have been staying at the Village Hotel Changi Club Floor for little over a month now and found it noteworthy to leave a few comments about this property before checking out.

The room is adequate for long stays with a king size bed and decent closet space. There are the typical perks of free WIFI, access to the Executive Lounge etc. Two pieces of laundry per day and complimentary local calls are a big bonus. The gym at Level 5 has a very low ceiling, so those who are tall (like me) have to be very careful not to knock their head!

There is a shuttle service provided to Changi Airport (Terminal 1 & 2) and Loyang Offshore Supply Base from the hotel which are provides convenient options to the guests. Bell men are generous enough to hail for taxis when they are hard to come by. The hotel also offers a complimentary 1-hour bike rental, which is something I wish to avail during my next stay.

The highlight of this stay has been the personalized service extended by the hotel staff in the Executive Lounge, notably Mr. Vignes and Ms. Gi An. They were extremely courteous and conscious of each guest's individual needs. Room service staff made the room like it was my own, commendable and again personalized.

There is certainly room for improvement in this property. The rooms could do with some upgrading and more vegetarian options need to be added to the menu. But the service levels are what sets this hotel apart. Wishing the team all the best!",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0

I had to check out at 2pm the next day but I had an appointment at 6pm so I requested for later check out which was also allowed at 4pm!

There are 2 staff which I would like to compliment for their superb standard of service! They are Sheda and Vignes. Vignes was the assistant manager which served me when I entered the hotel for check in.

Met them at the lounge as I was there relaxing and they were preparing for the evening cocktail. They were very friendly and had so much knowledge about what's good to do at Changi village and how to get to various places. Sheda even recommended me a place to bring my friends which was just round the corner called the coastal settlement. Vignes gave me a superb review about X men which was screening at that time..

I truly enjoyed my stay even more because of the service provided by the staff and the clean and superb room facilities!

So here is the review ..

1. The reception staff could be more aware of the reservation status ..in my case took longer than usual

2. Breakfast wasn't bad ..with an okay spread but could be improved a slight bit by a little effort (coffee tended to be very bitter) .

3. The bed had wheels..yes I am not joking :))

So if you wanted to lie back and pushed the wall therefore ..you would get wheeled ahead ..not a great idea .. So i was surprised why they would want to have it this way

4. WiFi was easy to access and had good speed ..so thanks for that

5. The hotel doesn't seem to be geared for anything out of the regular ..

I asked if I could get my suit ironed at their laundry. this was achieved after some explanations..even when I was willing to pay for the charges ..of course I was happy when they ironed it free of charge ..

6. Location very far from downtown ..at least SGD 25 each way by cab ..so add it to the hotel bill if you plan to stay here ..and want to go to downtown for fun or business

Was quite taken aback by the number of rooms they had; it sure doesnt look that big from outside.

They seem to have some minor works being done back of the house. The corridor leading to the room was all covered in cardboard. Room is decently-sized but came only with the bare essentials. And, it came uncarpeted which makes it feel like a holiday chalet. Minibar came empty, only 1 selection of coffee/tea packets. Room amenities (toothbrush/toothpaste) came in a poorly disguised Colgate lookalike.

solo,,False,,"not bad, not great either stayed here one night during a 24h stopover in singapore.

the hotel is distinctly average - the rooms are ok, clean and big, however the hotel is showing its age. the gym is nice and open 24/7 so good if you want to fit in some exercise. the rooftop pool (which was one of the main reasons why i booked this place) is ok. the view is great - you can watch the planes approach changi airport which is very nice at night, however it does not really have the infinity feel (mainly as the plexiglas at the end was fairly dirty).

the staff were very helpful, though often i found out things in hindsight (there is one shuttle to town, but at 1030 am only, which i got told at 1034am - this meant i had to get the airport shuttle and then travel from the airport to town - not too horrible, but added quite a bit of travel time. i wasnt in a rush so it was ok).

the airport shuttle goes once an hour and really you ought to be there 10 min earlier otherwise you might miss it. its a bit tricky to find the right place at terminal 1 and 2 to get to the hotel, and i missed one shuttle due to this, so had to wait 50min which was a bit frustrating - better explanation in the booking email would be great. the shuttle is 20-25min, definitely not 10 or 15. so if you miss the bus, you'd have to either wait an hour (if you can) or pay a lot for a taxi.

i kept changing my view whether an average or very good was appropriate, and decided for average - if 'good' would have been an option, that would have been my preferred verdict. as everything is slightly ageing and falling apart, the very good is not quite justified.

it's not bad, it's not great. for the price i would have probably expected a bit more in terms of service (when do busses go, where from, etc).

i did not try out any of the restaurants and breakfast was not included in my 'deal' so i cant comment on this.",2014-05-01,PreCovid,0

To start off, upon understanding that it was her birthday, Jonathan Ng, one of the managers there, arranged for an amazing room for us as well as an amazing cake for her.

The staff were incredibly helpful, helping us with our many enquiries, even helping us heat up some microwavable snacks we bought.

The pool was amazing, and the view was just great. When we encountered problems with starting up the jacuzzi, they dispatched a staff member to quickly assist us.

The rooms were immaculately cleaned, and the facilities were really impressive

Unfortunately, the room minibar's freezer compartment (or what we assumed was a freezer because of pieces of ice around it) either didnt have a proper freezer, or it malfunctioned, leaving our Ben and Jerry's icecream turning into a sad pile of slush.

that my bills being taken care of and I can go. I checked again if they need my credit card for extra charges the lady receptionist said no. I headed to the taxi stand and after 10odd minutes, the receptionist approached me at the taxi stand with many others in the Q asking me to sign for the extra charges which is truly embarrassing and unprofessional. I have asked upon checkout and in a way remind the reception to check my bill. Imagine what would have happened if I left in a taxi. Really upset with my stay at Village Hotel Changi.

Very helpful staff.",2014-05-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Stayed here a few times already The nice:

- Rooms are clean and big enough for two persons. The toilets are also very clean. Do note that this hotel has been around for a while, and though its age does show in some corners, it is still very well maintained.

- The 8th floor pool has a very nice view of the sea and airplanes flying to and from Changi Airport. I like to sit there, have a drink and chill out.

- The staff are generally very friendly and helpful.

- It‚Äôs a very quiet hotel, perfect for those who want peace and quiet. Yes, airplane noise is present, but it‚Äôs not frequent, and hardly noticeable in the rooms.

- Location! Just cross the road and you have Changi Village Food Centre ‚Äì lots of good, local food at hawker food prices. If you prefer more ‚Äòupscale‚Äô options, there are numerous eateries within walking distance. You definitely won‚Äôt go hungry from early morning till late night. Change Beach is also within walking distance. It‚Äôs a nice place to chill at if you like beaches.

The not-so-nice:

- There was this staff at the entrance who was not friendly at all. As mentioned in another review, front-door staff are usually the first hotel staff a guest encounters, and the staff guests ask for directions etc. An unfriendly one makes a bad first impression.

- The pastries in the lounge ran out and there was no refill. It was different at Village Katong where the pastries were always refilled. There were also only two types of cookies. A wider range would be good.

- The lounge could also do with more couches or sofas to make it more comfortable for guests. Right now, it‚Äôs mostly dining tables with chairs ‚Äì good for eating at and for writing, but not so comfortable for reading or chilling out. The outdoor sitting arrangements are better, but it is warm, and you get exposed to smokers.

- I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times, right from the days when it was still Le Meridian hotel, and so it‚Äôs disappointing that there is no membership or loyalty programme or special perks for regular guests. Now that Changi Village Hotel is not the only hotel in the Changi area, it will boil down to choosing the hotel with the lowest price since there‚Äôs no incentive for loyalty. It would be good for the hotel to offer regular guests some special perks (like special discounts or upgrades) to encourage them to continue to go to this hotel.

Tips:

- If you don‚Äôt intend to explore around and just want to hang around and chill, go for the club room option where you can use the lounge the whole day. It comes with free flow of tea, coffee and juices + some cookies. There are magazines and two internet-enabled terminals. What we like about the lounge is that we can just sit in there, relax, read and chit-chat. Do note that the room without or without club room option is the same room. You just get lounge access. And the evening finger-food is actually filling enough for dinner, if you don‚Äôt mind finger-food for dinner.

- Note that it tends to get crowded and busy during the usual check-in and check-out times, as with ANY hotel, so be patient, or check-in later or check-out earlier to avoid crowds.",2014-05-01,PreCovid,1

The hotel was much bigger than I expected but check in smooth after booking directly through their website. Clean well appointed room and comfortable bed. Loved the rooftop pool where you can watch the planes take off. You're very close to the airport which cuts down on your travel time. A godsend for us who overslept before our flight out but the receptionist noted our panic and let us go without the usual paperwork. And we still had time for a coffee at the airport. We didn't use their shuttle as didn't want to wait due to our limited time but a taxi was only $12 from the airport. Would definitely stay there Again.,2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Relaxing staycation Booked a deluxe room for the Good Friday long weekend and was pleasantly surprised. Prior to the stay, I emailed the hotel and made some enquiries - if there was complimentary parking coupon, if the TV in-room can be connected to the laptop via HDMI cable and request for two wine glasses. Received a prompt reply (and YES to know, for those who are interested) and my first impression of the hotel was good. Chose the deluxe room instead of the superior room as I read that the superior rooms are located at the second level and I preferred a higher floor room with sea view.
Reached at 12pm plus on Good Friday to check in and was pleasantly surprised when my room was ready for us. The check-in process was very fast and we had free wifi with our booking. Quickly went to the room and deposited our belongings before heading out to Changi Village for lunch. There are many food choices in the vicinity and we were spoilt for choices. Upon our return, there were two wine glasses outside our room door before I called to remind them. Their service standard is pretty good in my opinion. I ever had an experience with another hotel where something was promised but forgotten, rather disappointing.
Anyway, the room was very comfortable! Basic amenities and toiletries were provided. Loved the rain shower! The bed was rather soft for me but my partner loved it! The TV is pretty large and the glass wall by the shower/bathtub allowed the user to watch TV while showering (if you are not shy, otherwise can roll down the window shade). Our room was at the fifth floor and could have a great view facing the sea. However, due to construction of the Civil Service Club in front, the view was disappointing, though not of any fault of the hotel. The sound proofing was not that bad I'd say, as there were a few families with children/babies and while I could hear them crying when I was along the corridor, I couldn't hear them when I was in the room.
Visited the museum nearby and the infinity pool at level 8. One downside was that due to the large number of pool users, there was insufficient pool towels and it was not replenished even when another guest called to request for it - at least till we left the pool it was still empty. Didn't do much activities as we planned to relax and chill. However, Changi Beach is nearby and Pulau Ubin is only a short bum boat ride away!

The hotel has value for money corporate rates and there's an ongoing cycling staycation package.   Due to the Good Friday holiday, there was a long queue at the front office when I arrived at 2.15pm. I finally checked into my room at about 2.45pm. The other room which I've booked was ready about an hour later. To my surprise, the front office staff Fahmi and his manager turned up at my room and apologised for the delay and inconvenience. They even gave us a cake as an apology. Upon my return after dinner, the carpark was full. I approached Fahmi for assistance and he kindly helped me to find a vacant lot.   Some of the rooms are currently going through a renovation. I'm sure future guests can look forward to upgraded rooms.  The gym is good and as usual, the rooftop pool is a great place to rest and relax.  I would like to thank Fahmi and the hotel management for making this staycation a very special one. I'll definitely be back soon for another staycation.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,1

couple,,False,,"Nice stay over close to airport We had a short two-day stay in Singapore on our return trip from our honeymoon. Our inbound flighted landed just before midnight, so Village Hotel Changi was a good option because of its proximity to the airport.

We arrived exhausted (and really sick) and we were greeted by a lovely member of staff at reception - he and his partner (wife now I am sure!) both work at the hotel and it was just the day before they take leave to go back to Burma for their wedding. He deeply sympathised with our post stress conditions and made the check in process very quick and easy. The free upgrade to a club room was also very kind considering my husband was really sick and having access to the club lounge for extra tea/juice was just so thoughtful. Our interaction with the rest of the staff during our stay was also wonderful - they were always eager to help and are always considerate. Thank you, staff :)

The rooms are reasonably sized for Singapore standard and the bathroom well equiped (though a bit small). The rain shower was fantastic with good water pressure.

The club room breakfast and nibbles during happy our was nice, with standard supply of tea/coffee, cold drinks and small snacks (biscits and fruit) through out the day.

There were functions after functions happening at the roof top pool area during our stay, so I didn't get to check out the infinity pool - which is a shame as it looked nice in the picture and it was so hot. There is another pool on the ground floor but you can only access it by walking through a restaurant. This is quite awkward, as who wish to do that by themselves especially after the swim when you are soaking wet and smelt of chlorine and others are having dinner.

There are quite a few other activites outside the hotel to do though - the beach is only a 5 minute walk away, there are some great hawker food to check out in Changi village, Pulau Ubin island is only a ferry trip away, and you can also hire a bike from the hotel or the local vendors and ride along the water front for 3.6km.

This is a very good choice if you do not want to engage in the hussle and bussle of central Singapore or if you are only looking for a short stay between flights. We would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future.",2014-03-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel is near the mosque and the shops at the hotel's mall sell abayas and indian garments. I was hoping to buy some souvenirs. Money exchange centers are scattered.

couple,,False,,"Great for overnight Transfer, Staycation I had a pleasure of staying in Village Hotel Changi as I arrived on an evening flight and the airport pick up services was prompt, efficient and is very professional. Upon arrival at the hotel, along with other guests on the same shuttle, I had to wait for about 15-20 minutes before I was checked in. I hope there will be more check-in counters available to cater for guests that arrive at the hotel via the airport shuttle.

My room was clean, and the stay was very pleasant. I had a bathtub in my room with shower needs and all the amenities - mineral water , good-sized TV with in-room safe and fridges were also provided.

Even though this hotel is located away from the city, local public transport bus will bring you to 'urban' areas like Tampines and Bedok Interchange (Bus 12 or 29 if I'm not wrong). This hotel is practically perfect for travellers who need an overnight accommodation for connecting flights, so I wouldn't rate down for this.

friends,,False,,"Work/Personal I had work in Singapore nearer to Changi side, so I was looking specifically for a business hotel. Village Hotel Changi by Far East Hospitality, seemed to fit the bill and I have stayed in that area so I assumed it would be convenient. Unfortunately the hotel was not as convenient to get to and you need to call for a cab and hope it will make it to you on time. The local area is what saves the hotel and the beach, so there are places to walk around to.

The hotel lobby is basic and the 7 Eleven was a saver. I decided to upgrade to a Clubroom, assuming the facilities will be better and they have separate lounge area. I was heavily disappointed by the lounge because there were little ants by the pastry section and the all day food didn't look fresh. The room was small - a little to compact for my liking. The bed was very low and not very comfortable.

The pool on the roof top was an interesting concept and a likeable element to the hotel. The hotel staff were friendly but we had some pretty bad downer moments. Overall I didn't enjoy this hotel and wouldn't necessarily come back to stay there.",2013-09-01,PreCovid,0

We chose this hotel to get away from crowds and to perhaps visit pulau ubin or pengerrang for day trips. We did neither of these as the kids were happy, just being in the pool. 2 pools to choose from. There were also bicycles to loan from hotel, board walks around changi and getting good food was not a problem.
Like:
- the hotel breakfast and daily change in variety
- the hotel was not crowded but with good traffic to its restaurants and there were various functions going on... the bustling atmosphere was good
- the infinity pool with good view of the sea, planes taking off, birds flying past and falcons soaring high in the evening
Dislike:
- the bed...it was too hard
- the pillows...too soft
- the tap at the bath tub was not working...and although the rain shower was nice, that was the only choice...no shower heads, so your hair will get wet

Overall, we enjoyed our stay, though we missed our own beds. The facilities and service is adequate for a 4-star hotel.

Cleanliness in rooms was lacking too. Toilet wall tiles had stains and the bath tub, albeit huge, was dirty when checked in. There was still sand, dirt and hair in it.

Overall stay, not too bad. Got a surprise room upgrade due to my wife's bday from deluxe to club room.
Checkin is abit slow as there are only 2 service officers.

Rooms-wise, although small but pretty adequate. Amenities in working condition, but can see its aging but i think the balcony needs to be upgraded asap as the steel flooring is rusty...

The Executive lounge, is small but cosy, wth the norms included, coffee, tea, drinks and some snacks. Happy hour with the usual alcohol included.
A feedback, do consider to change some of the chairs to sofas as it will be more comfortable since its a lounge and not a cafe and do u provide ice? Coz i dont see it.

The 2 pools are pretty nice and clean except for the few dead leaves and branches that couldnt really blame the hotel.
However, i think they shld limit kids below a certain age from the rooftop pool. Being noisy aside, its pretty dangerous as they ran along the barricade which they might fall from the rooftop.

Breakfast is pretty standard, dont expect 5star variety and quality but i think its good enough. There is always more option once you venture out of the hotel to the nearby changi village which is well-known for good local fare.

There was another couple in the bar who, after 10 minutes got up and left as they hadn't even been served, and the bar was empty apart from the 3 of us.

The hotel seems to be used for people in transit, and given it's proximity to the airport this makes sense. There is an abundance of takeaway/quick eat options in walking distance but not much else.
As I didn't have my luggage with me I wasn't able to use the gym facilities but I had a peek inside and the machines look new and well maintained.
I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my room. All the usual iron, bathrobe, hair dryer, slippers, tea/coffee is provided and the layout makes the room seem spacious. I have not been so fortunate on previous trips to Singapore.
Had a buffet lunch on arrival, the food was tasty and I wish I wasn't so tired that I could have had a go at the make your own laksa station. Getting coffee brought to the table required some prodding as the waiters are rushing (but also possibly just a little disorganised).
I am unable to comment on the value as it was paid by the airline, but if I do have a layover and am not interested in seeing any sights or want to be close to the airport I would certainly come back here.",2013-12-01,PreCovid,0

It doesn't have all the amenities of an international hotel which is why it only gets 4 stars and not 5, but it definitely has one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever had even in competitive Singapore.

The hotel is within walking distance to the Changi Ferry point, where one may board ferries rides to neighbouring islands.There are regular shuttle bus services between the airport and the hotel.  If you plan on staying at this hotel, enquire about this free service.  It is not advertised on their website.  There is also a shuttle service to the city centre (one per day). If you'd like to use the MRT (an excellent means of getting around the island), you'll need to get to the airport first (using the shuttle bus service: once per hour) - these need to be factored into your journey plans.The room I stayed in was small but clean.  There was little or no information about the services provided by the hotel.  There was also no information about the places of interest/current events in the hotel room.  However, there is some information in the hotel lobby.  There is free wifi in the rooms, which means that you can use your laptop or tablet to enquire about things around the island.The restaurant offers buffet breakfast and the fare was quite good.

the executive lounge is lovely. cosy setting with beverages like coffee, tea, soft drinks and bottled water available till 11pm. food is available at scheduled times. cocktail happy hour was however a little disappointing. only red & white wine available plus beer. you actually have to make the cocktail yourself!
the cafe's daily buffet serves a variety of local food like laska, lor mee, hokkien mee, char kuay teow, kueh pai tee, nonya kuehs, roti prata, roasted pork, char siew, satay etc. among the other buffet spread. excellent ideas for travellers to sample the local cuisine.
gym facilities is adequate, although I kept switching on the other treadmill machine's TV channel whenever I used the TV remote control as the TVs were placed so close together.
the pool area is lovely. on sunday, the pool water was a little cloudy. was better on subsequently days.

Rooms: Are clean and comfortable although overpriced for the hotels distance from central Singapore. Damp smell in many rooms. Personal opinion, high rates achieved purely because of the limited accommodation close to Loyang Offshore Supply Base.
Location: Hotels location to the main highlights of Singapore are probably the greatest distance of all hotels. In peak hour it could take 30 - 45 minutes or more to reach City centre, Sentosa and other.

Check-in at the hotel was quick, efficient and very friendly, and my wake-up call and shuttle transfer for the next morning dutifully noted and carried out.
The room was large and comfortable but way too cold, so even with the A/C off, could have done with an extra duvet. Once the A/C was off, there was quite a noticeable smell of old tobacco smoke which you don't experience much anymore in hotels nowadays.

We had gone to Gardens by the Bay for the day, and at the end of the day had gone across to do a harbour cruise before I realised my camera was missing. That put a dampener on the outing, so we went back to the hotel. There, we spoke to Ricky, one of the reception staff. By the time we left Singapore 4 hours later, we were so impressed! Ricky made it his personal mission to recover the camera for us before we left, the camera was located, and a taxi driver drove out of his way down to Changi Village to drop the camera off to us with 30 minutes to spare before we caught the shuttle to the airport. We were stunned and delighted! This was especially important to us because my father is 88 years old and the chances of being able to return to Gardens by the Bay to collect more memories are somewhat reduced...so the memories are very important. What Ricky did for us was priceless, and we hope he goes as far in the company as he deserves to go. All with a smile, and ""it is my job to look after our guests"". What more could you want?

Although not in the centre of Singapore the hotels location is excellent. Outside of the hotel are hawker stalls selling lots of tasty and cheap meals and Changi Beech itself. There is an abundance of wildlife nearby and it is truly a gorgeous place to stay to get away from it all, yet still being within easy reach of the city and the other delights of Singapore.

Rooms are comfortable and provide anything you would need for a quick stopover without rifling through all your gear - towels, personal hygiene products, all the amenities you need and easy wifi access.  A real pleasure to stopover and for a short visit in Singapore.  Taxi to the city for our look around was cheap enough $25 SGD which for 4 of us was nothing! On return to the hotel having checked out over 8 hours ago they accommodated the 4 of us with a fresh shower towels etc for our ongoing flight! would definitely stay again if was another quick stopover and the after showering jumped in the hourly shuttle to the airport! it's nice after a long holiday to not have to continually dig into your wallet for shuttles or anything!  Possibly too far out for a lengthy stay in Singapore unless what you were after was out the area of the airport!  a few Hawker food centre just up from the hotel that were still buzzing with families and friends while we went for a look at 1am after showering checking in etc was a nice way not have to go to far with such a late arrival! tip don't order a coffee in the hotel lobby it was 5.98 for a tea cup size coffee!",2013-10-01,PreCovid,0

Taxi to/from airport, dinner, breakfast and room rate was paid by the airline. Our luggage did not make it out of the airport either.

Our mood was not great, but upon arrival at the hotel (15-20min max taxi ride, approx S$22), the staff made everything as efficient and smooth as possible.

I'm absolutely sure they deal with disgruntled delayed passengers on a daily basis, but our CS staff - ZAFFRY - at the front desk looked after us with information, booking next day taxi, wifi, dinner/breakfast vouchers with a friendly smile. Even the friendly concierge staff went out of their way to help us with our wifi code when we enquired later that evening.

Buffet dinner was great, we were not expecting this level of quality. Clean and delicious selection of food.

Rooms were adequate, fairly standard...adequate for a short overnight transit stay. Beds a little uncomfortable, but ok.

I usually stay at Crowne Plaza Changi for overnight transits, you can't beat this location, but it's a very expensive hotel..... will consider Village Hotel next time if the price is substantially more affordable.

solo,,False,,Overnight stay near Singapore airport I stayed at this hotel recently for an overnight stay between flights - for once I took the advice of a travel agent - I usually do my own research and booking.     I found the room to be very basic and expensive for what it was - almost $200 CAD for a basic room on the 3rd floor.  The carpet in the room had many stains and there was an annoying flickering light and when the AC was not on I could smell old cigarette smoke in the room.      I was offered an upgrade at an extra cost to be higher in the building with a view which I declined. Breakfast was not included in the rate. .     The restaurant has a good varied menu and the pool is great.    For an overnight stay I think I would have been better off at the airport transit hotel or tried to get a good deal at the Crowne Plaza attached to the airport.   The hotel does have a free shuttle to the airport and it takes about 20 mins for the transfer.   This might be a more suitable hotel for a couple of nights or more when you can enjoy the pool and/or a walk on the beach nearby....5 minute walk away. Nearby the hotel there are several cafes and franchised food options.    I was disappointed with the room at the rate.   The staff were very efficient and friendly.   .,2013-10-01,PreCovid,0

solo,,False,,"Relaxing stopover I've stayed at Village Hotel Changi three times and on every occasion have found the hotel clean and comfortable and the staff courteous, helpful and professional. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them.

Email inquiries received prompt replies and requests were met where possible. From one of those replies I learnt that superior rooms were on the 2nd and 3rd floors, while deluxe rooms were on the 4th, 5th and 7th floors and had better views.

The hotel may not be the newest or most modern in the area, but it had everything I needed on a 2-day stopover - somewhere safe, clean and comfortable to rest in a part of Singapore that has a relaxed air, an excellent hawker centre, a selection of restaurants and ready access to the airport, about 15min away.

A shuttle bus runs on the hour from the hotel between 5am and 1am and leaves from Terminals 1 and 2 about 25min past the hour until around 1.30am.

Landing at Terminal 3 meant an easy monorail transfer to get to the T2 arrival area, where Ground Transport Desk staff informed the shuttle driver he had a passenger the next time he went past. At T2 the wait was in air-conditioned comfort.

Shops at Changi village and the 7-11 store at the hotel sell basic necessities but busy, large suburban shopping malls, such as the ones at Tampines, are only about a 15min taxi ride away.

For a fare of under $2 (in coins or using an MRT card), bus no. 29 will take you from the bus stop on the same side as the hotel to Tampines interchange and shops in around 25min.

City shopping centres are less than an hour away and the hotel provides a one-way shuttle service to the corner of Orchard and Scotts roads at 10.30am each day. Both the airport and Tampines have excellent MRT connections to the city, taking around 25min, but require an MRT card.

I don't recall seeing a moneychanger near the hotel, so it's best to change money at the airport.

You get free laundry 2 pieces daily, unlimited soft drinks, free wifi, happy hour drinks daily & additional room amenities so it's certainly worth the cost to upgrade.

I found the hotel to be very clean, room service was always prompt in the morning.

The hotel is in a great location, just down from all the bars and eateries that Changi village has to offer.

Taxis are very cheap in Singapore and are always on hand at the front of the hotel.

The rooftop pool and sun terrace are definitely worth a visit, the view of the planes landing at Changi is breathtaking you can almost see the passengers on board!

Breakfast was mainly eaten in the club lounge which was very good, I also had a meal in the Italian restaurant on the 8th floor, again this was also excellent.

The Good: Restaurants are great, room service selections are good. Executive upgrade (S$50) provided wifi, breakfast and access to an executive room for relaxing / meeting. Free shuttle (on the hour from 5am I believe) to the airport is an excellent service. Service is good.

The Not so Good: It's a bit untidy. Marked walls in the corridors, stains on the carpet in the room, pool area etc all could use some attention. Location is quite poor.

Since it is already at the highest floor, I guess I cant request much. Can't blame the hotel. Maybe the rooms by the side would be better but they could be of suites, to provide a better view.

The swimming pool is really pretty. Beautiful views. They have another swimming pool at the lower ground but it is like an aquarium, the infinity pool at the highest floor is definitely better.

F&B is not a problem, since not only do they have their own restaurants, there's tons of options outside. I will definitely recommend people to go out to try all the good & cheaper local dishes at the hawker centres or the prata shops that open til wee hours. There's also a small 7-11 at the lobby level with limited choices & marked up prices. Walk further out (less than 10min walk) for more options.

From the very begining when I arrived to the Hotel, and approached to the 'check in' counters.
I was greeted by the very friendly front office staffs, which was normally everywhere. And while the staff was handling my check in, he was selling his services & the hotel to us etc...
It might looked as if it is just a normal routine that they have to do.
But for me, myself. I do really feel the sincerity in him and from his 'heart'. I can also feel and sense his extra mile within the period he was doing the check in and recomendations about everything they have in the hotel itself.
Eventually, we were early and have to wait for the room to be ready. So we decieded to go for a swim while waiting for the room.
With just a little more, he offered to to send us the room keys to the roof top swimming pool when it is ready.
Over here I would like to congra the 'Village Hotel Changi' management team for havin a well trained staff like him in your property. The staff you have is name, 'Ron'. Please do encourage him and keep him with you. I believe he cant recall who am I, but I would like to wish him all the best in his career with 'Village Hotel Managements'.

This is a place for the locals like me who would love to have a short getaway with their family.
The roof top swimming pool is great to rest and you can get the plane flying by to land at changi airport.

It is value for money, and unfortunately I didn't tried the cafe n the italian rstnt they have.
I understand it will not be easy for Chef over there, as it is very competitive over there with the food hawker centre and small rstnts and coffeeshops. But keep it up CHEFS, You Can Do It!

Although I didnt tried the food in the Hotel, but I went around to visit the heritages which 'Ron' introduces to us. It was a nice programme being organised by the Fast East Group. I met a chef at Orchard Central, named David Yong. We tried his Chicken Rice, Poh piah, Grass Jelly beverage and coffee Black.
I would say it is just so authentic, tasty and fantastic, the olden days feeling is there, the chef 'David Yong' and his staffs were great and excellent with their great services and are all friendly. introducing their dishes slowly and patiently.
Chef David even guide us through the other sites or places related with the heritage programme. He was marvellous and have been on his extra miles in food and services too.
later then I realised he is also from the Village Hotel Changi, and was send to set up the place with his excellent authentic food in Orchard Central.
And so! this is another staff? And from the back of the house? A chef? That can make a very big difference, WOW!!!
WELL DONE! 'Village Hotel Changi' You have the right people the right chefs who have the right attitutes towards the best.

As for the hotel coffee house n the rstnt, as we did not have enough time to visit you.
Maybe the next time I return to this Hotel I will try and let you know about it in here :)

During the check out, we met Miss Jamna, she was also as great as Mr,. Ron. She was great and friendly with our check out. And also about the heritage inofrmations too. I think I have written to much in here lol. Sorry Jamna, but you are excellent too.

business,4.0,True,Positive,"There is a lot to like about this hotel if your trip is short one There is really a lot to like about this hotel if your trip to Singapore is a short one.

For one, the hotel is only a short distance from the Changi International Airport, making it ideal if you happen to have a short layover or short visit to Singapore for a conference or business meeting. It's convenient location from the airport, saves you the trouble to beat traffic to/fro from city downtown. Changi Village is a little neighborhood enclave that you can within walking distance, find groceries, excellent local foods at all times of the day, especially a late night supper if you get in late.

This is an excellent place to stay if you happen to be in SIngapore for a conference/exhibition at the Changi Expo Convention Centre.

The hotel is big, with rooms of various sizes but most comfortable are club rooms on 6th floor, in the 7 storey triangle shaped building. The club lounge is on the 6th floor and pool is on the rooftop deck. There are some excellent meeting facilities (especially for small groups) and coffee house on lobby floor is pleasant bright and functional. There is a nice bar for after hours drinks and even a Japanese restaurant on the lobby level.

However, the rooms are basic - even the club rooms are standard and functionally decorated. The bathrooms are bit small and the club rooms do not have a shower, so it feels a bit cramped when you are trying to shower in the tub. But the club rooms make it up by having unlimited and good internet access with good WiFI throughout the hotel, with minimal fuss - just log in with your room number and password, and you stay connected. The gym and pool is pleasant, especially in the evenings where the infinity pool overlooks the planes landing over Changi Airport.

The staff is efficient, and in particular... the house keeping staff is very polite and greet all guests.

All in all, if you need a nice place to stay away from the crowds or tourists, for some quiet meeting away from the city, this is a good stop.

I wanted a room with a view of the ocean and was upgraded at check-in by a very kind clerk who moved me to the 7th floor (my original booking was for the 3rd floor). With that I had a view of the water, ships passing, and airplanes landing at Changi Airport, and that made a lot of difference. I even saw a monkey playing on the crane across the street early Sunday morning, a reminder that you are not far from the tropical forest here.

The room was a bit small but was not a problem for me as I was alone. Two bottles of water were available. There is a convenience store on the ground floor with very limited selection but enough if you need to buy a couple of beers. Changi Village has a number of hawker stalls for a cheap lunch or dinner; there are restaurants in the hotel but they seemed a bit expensive.

Location is far from downtown and there is no MRT nearby. There are a number of buses that can get you there with a transfer; you will need to do a bit of research, but expect at least an hour. Taxis would probably cost around $20-25 to get to the main tourist area around Marina Bay.

The ferry terminal is just across the way and you can take a bumboat to Ubin for $5 return. The hotel is about 10km from the airport. I guess the free shuttle is adequate, although I did not take it.

I would say that the hotel is somewhat overpriced (I got a deal on Orbitz so paid less than the rack rate), but this is Singapore so your choices are limited.

business,,False,,"Extremely disappointing I stayed for two nights in this hotel. Singapore is famous for the quality of its hotels and the high grade service they provide. Given the 4* rating of the Village, I expected good things, especially since I had booked an Executive Club room, carefully specifying that twin beds were essential.
Registration was trouble-free, but it was nearly the last thing which was. There was a double bed and when I pointed out the error, house-keeping sent up a roller-bed which made the room most crowded and unsightly. The Executive Lounge is open for (free) drinks and small chow in the evening and for breakfast in the morning. The food was barely adequate: no hot plates were provided and the hot food was tepid even before it arrived on the cold plates. Breakfast was rather pathetic: no bacon, no eggs, luke-warm fried rice and an unimpressive selection of breads. There is an attractive outdoor seating area: the first evening I elected to have a cocktail out there. Unfortunately, it had rained some eight hours earlier and the cushions had soaked up moisture: I sat down therefore in an invisible puddle. No apology was offered: I was told that ""this happens sometimes""!! Is it asking too much for staff to dry up after rain?
Things got worse. One of the hand basins in the attractive bathroom was totally blocked: incredibly, both the taps in the shower gushed water which was too hot to bear - something I have never come across before. I asked to see the duty manager, who promised a change of room later in the morning. At the appointed time I was offered the choice of two rooms: BOTH were a grade lower than the executive room I had booked and paid for and one reeked of smoke. Through the efforts of one member of staff, I was eventually upgraded to a junior suite, but the gesture was spoiled by the delay. In both the rooms I used, the wifi was good.
I was careful not to appear angry, but the response of front-of-house staff was woefully inadequate. Some serious training is needed. The F&B operation needs checking as does maintenance. All this is a disappointment as the hotel is clean and attractive and nicely located for a day or two resting. It is much too far from the centre either for business or for night life.

Nothing is near to it except a golf course and the beach is not too far. It is nowhere near an mrt station and I even had difficulty getting a taxi to return to the airport at 4 a.m. I lucked out when a taxi stopped to bring a fare to the hotel. In fact, my driver confirmed that taxis do not stop by regularly as it is very much out of the way. The hotel does run a shuttle but it is not twenty four hours. I believe they also run shuttles to downtown and other areas but who wants to spend all their time trying to time a shuttle ride and waste time riding shuttles during vacation? Having said that, the hotel itself is very nice. The pool area is great, the rooms are large, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast and free wi fi in the rooms were also a nice bonus. Local food is available just up the road. The bike rental is also a nice plus. They try hard to overcome their location problems. If you need to stay in this area for business or other reasons, this would be a good choice. For an airport stopover, it is not bad if you confirm the shuttle times or book a taxi in advance. For any other reasons, I would look elsewhere.",2013-08-01,PreCovid,0

This hotel is located at the far corner of the island, next to Changi boardwalk, Changi beach and Pulau Ubin. Nature lovers can hike and bike.

To top it off, the service at the hotel was superb. The manager gave us a room with great view, helped us with the laundry and was so friendly that we felt totally at home.

The hotel has seen better days from the outside compared with a few years ago (i think a quick paint job is required) but the lobby and restaurant area is just as impressive. i booked the cheapest room, for which they automatically give you twin beds, i think in the hope that you upgrade to a queen or king bed. and speaking of upgrading, well there are plenty of upgrade options available when you check-in....dont worry you wont miss them they are plastered all over the reception desk when you check in. so in my opinion i would get the cheapest room and then upgrade when you arrive, not in advance or you will probably end up spending more.

I suggest that you go ahead and add-on breakfast even though it is pricey. It was the usual 3-4 star fare, but there isn't going to be Western breakfast located nearby.

I used the gym, and it was too warm for me. I had to wet a towel and put it around my neck. when using the elliptical. The machines are good enough, but the ellipticals and bikes could benefit from being updated with newer models with the latest functions.

I never eat in hotel restaurants, apart from breakfast - I can never see the point - so I can't comment on food in the hotel. I like to get out and eat in places full of local people making lots of noise and enjoying themselves. I never visit Starbucks or Western places either, again I don't see the point.

The rooms are superb, clean, a good size and have excellent amenities including a super bathroom, which is very large and has a great wet area. All towels and bed linen are fresh and clean too. Room cleaning service is thorough and done with a smile. Again, this is another hotel where the staff really are on top of their game. Nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with a smile apart from the bus transfer drivers - see below.

The club lounge is not huge but I never saw it over crowded. The staff are great and breakfast is very good too. It's less rushed and quieter than the main breakfast place downstairs. Wifi works really well in the club lounge as it does in the room.

check in was very quick as was check out. Both are a boon when you arrive after a 12 hour flight, or you have a flight to catch out of Changi.

It's not a cheap place to stay but then prices in Singapore and the city centre especially can be as high as London prices. Given it's out of the city location, I think it's ok value for Singapore.

We had travelled long haul and couldn't be bothered waiting so paid for a cab $17sgd instead.  The hotel was clean and the bed good.

Nice and very quiet, even tho it is adjacent to the Changi Airport.  A swim up on the rooftop pool was great, watching all the aircraft coming and going from the airport.Dont expect this to be a 5 star type hotel, more like a 3.5 to 4 star.  Hotel is clean and tidy, quite minimilistic, rooms are small, but once again clean and tidy.  The windows were covered in algae/mould on the outside, they really need a clean now and then.We were on a non-smoking floor and the first room they gave us had a thick haze of cigarette smoke from some inconsiderate previous guest.  Gave us another room next day when one became available....second room was totally smoke free (and had a better view too).  This is the only real complaint that we had with the hotel, and it was fixed quickly and without fuss.Meals are pretty average, seems to cater to asian style more than western tastes.Beer was good tho from the bar, happy hour was the best time of the day! A word of advice.......DO NOT EAT at the italian restaurant on the top floor of the hotel....to put it bluntly, it was bloody aweful, food was horrible, and grossly overpriced, staff all looked as they had somewhere better to be......total waste of money and time.

I loved the automatic lighting in the robe that activates upon opening, free access to the internet and the early morning delivery of the newspaper.

This time round, I am back with my 3 kids and husband for a staycation. Chose to stay in this hotel mainly because I wanted to be away from the city area. If you are a lover of the rustic Singapore of the past, this hotel is the place for you.
Check in was simple and with ease. I got a good upgrade and for a nominal fee, I went from superior room to executive suite level. Not bad! Thank you, Ronald!
With that, I get to access the lounge and help myself to the drinks and amenities there. Pity the area is not permissible for kids below 12. My children could only watch from the outside as we scamper in to get some drinks to be used in the room. I would have wished that at least in the afternoons, the children can be given entry access too.
The pool was one of those that's a mimic of the infinity pool that is so popular now with many hotels. It's a tad small but functional.
Saltwaters, the coffeehouse, has great staff who are friendly and helpful with children. The prices though are a tad high but if you are in the mood for a getaway, I guess it's not too bad.

Hotel staff was very friendly. Check in was a breeze!! We wanted to try out the spa at the rooftop but was told that it was fully booked, chilling by the pool itself is relaxing for us. We tried the buffet bbq dinner, not up to our expectation but there were a variety of local cuisines to try. Breakfast was good though.

On arrival, we were upgraded to the executive club room which gives you access to the executive lounge. Needless to say, it was a surprising welcome gift and both my wife and I were delighted at the generosity of the hotel staff.

This was our 5th time staying at the hotel and just like previous stays, this one did not fail to impress. Service at the reception was warm and hospitable and the receptionist tried her best to meet our requests. Service at the club lounge was also good with staff serving breakfast and engaging you to see how best your needs can be further met.

We also explored the roof top pool, gymnasium and the nearby changi village hawker centre for it's rich food fare. The location of the hotel is perfect for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of urban life.

Special mention must be made for shahirah the receptionist who I felt was very patient and professional in handling requests of guests. We also want to highlight Ishfareed the staff who served us at the executive club lounge during breakfast for his hospitality and warmth in engaging us and making the effort to arrange a surprise marriage anniversary gift for us in our room with a cake, bottle of wine and a teddy bear.

couple,,False,,"Good for a weekend. We stayed here overnight in transit. We have previously stayed at Changi Airport Crowne Plaza but this place was half the price and seemed quite close to the airport. It took about 15-20 mins by taxi. On arrival, there was a rather large and slow moving queue, and we had to wait for quite a while before being checked in. The man at reception was very apologetic about the wait, and advised us that we had been upgraded to an executive room, and that my previously emailed request for non-feather pillows had been accommodated. Breakfast was not included, but we chose to add this on to our stay because it was discounted to half price for pre-paying the night before. On arrival at our room, it was spotless, of good size, with nice robe and slippers. Unfortunately the bathroom has not been designed well, and the shower has a rather large gap between the wall and the shower curtain, resulting in us flooding half of the bathroom. This, I think, would be easily fixed by adding a glass panel to the side of the wall. The location is good, with a 7-11 downstairs and many excellent quality and good value 24 hour eateries a few metres down the road. The beach is nearby, as is a golf course, and the hotel has two really lovely looking pools which we did not have time to try out. Breakfast was good, there was a lot of variety of both Eastern and Western options - not all to my liking, but that's the point: everyone should be happy with something on their menu. I would happily stay here again and would like to stay for a couple of days to enjoy the hotel's facilities and the nearby beach.

There was also 2 bottles of complimentary water provided in the room.
The only negative if I could point this out was there was no soap in the bathroom to wash our hands but there was shampoo and bath gel. This may have been an oversight but we had our own anyway.
We did not have breakfast but had lunch at one of the many local eateries just 150mtrs down the road and Dinner in the Cantina in Venezia (their restaurant on the top floor).

We didn't select a breakfast package as preferred to eat at the local hawker stalls. but had Coffee/tea in the Lobby caf√© and it was really good coffee. The cakes looked fabulous.

Check out is normally 12noon, but we were able to store our bags whilst sightseeing then go back to the hotel and use the pool, wifi and free showers in the Gym. Our flight wasn't until late evening and the hotel said we were welcome to use the facilities until we needed to leave for the airport (7pm) then we were able to use the free shuttle bus back to the airport.

This was a fabulous hotel choice, especially as we didn't intend to go into the city this time. Just down the road (less than 100metres) is a fantastic hawker food market, the selection so great that it's almost too much to be able to make a choice. Busses to Changi War Museum stop at the hawker food market and run to the 'door' of the museum - Take Bus 2.
A taxi to Kranji Memorial from the Hotel was only $24 one way. We didn't end up going to Pulau Ubin, but the wharf to catch the bumboat over is just down the road.

Will definitely stay here again.",2013-05-01,PreCovid,0

I chose it because I was flying in at midnight and didn't want to have to travel far into the city.  The rooms were clean and satisfactory.

But, Singapore Airlines solved it by means of a hotel voucher for a nearby hotel, the Changi Village Hotel. I had never been there but had heard of it. It was a bit off from the city, near the airport say 20 minutes by taxi, and a pleasant surprise.

We arrived at 2 AM, the staff was very friendly upon check-in (arranged taxi to get paid by SIA), and made accommodations for an extra bed in our room because my daughter was travelling with me so we were 3. We received 3 vouchers each for the buffet in the hotel. The room was simple, but ok, clean, a nice bed, good shower (even rain model), overall a nice pleasant room for a good night sleep. We went into town during the day because our flight was the next evening. Paid about 25 SGD for a taxi going to Orchard Road, and later back.

Overall our stay at Changi Village hotel was nice, especially very friendly staff, helpful and accommodating. Thank you !!

One minor point only, with the buffet I ordered 2 glasses of red wine (and not full glasses actually kinda meagerly little), that set me back 28 SGD ...... now that is a minus for me.

couple,,False,,"Potential ****OR*****But***Average I stayed in Changi Village Hotel 17-20th April 2013.  This hotel has the potential to be a four or five star hotel, sadly, they're stuck at 3 star.  The room that we originally booked was not available because they didn't have doubles, queens, or kings available; we originally requested a non-smoking room.  They put us in a smoking room which they corrected once they were notified.  We booked this hotel on Hotel.com and the picture deceptively showed a king or queen bed while the caption indicated twin superior.  We found out later that this hotel takes to single beds and join them to make a queen or quasi-king.Check-in was a bit slow but efficient.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  The hotel overall appearance was clean and so was our room.  We left the do not disturb sign on by mistake and they didn't clean our room, but they left us a note in the room explaining that was why they didn't clean the room.  I found that very strange.  Obviously, they knew we weren't in the room.  Then, it was about 8 o'clock that evening they called up and asked if we wanted our room to be clean.  We were too tired and exhausted from our day trip to allow then access at that time.The buffet breakfast and dinner buffet was predominantly Asian not enough western cuisine presented.  The room service menu was a better selection more comprehensive selections.  I thought they should have offered ala carte menu for light eaters that do not want to eat buffet and perhaps save some money.  Buffet breakfast $22 + Buffet dinner $36 + Singapore Dollars.  I am a coffee and toast person in the morning sometimes with a pastry.  The location of the hotel is 30-35 minutes outside of the city, if, you travel by bus, taxi, or metro the travel time is about the same.  The hotel offers free shuttle service every hour to the airport and at the airport you can take the metro (MRT/LRT) into the city for about $2.40 SGD to downtown.  Another option is to go to the bus terminal adjacent and behind the hotel to take the # 109 bus to Paris Rils (central) walk 100 meters and take the east/west green line of the metro to downtown about 30-35 minutes.  Whether you travel by bus or metro take small money because they don't take large bills.  Exchange for  2 dollar bills and one dollar coins which you can use for bus or metro.The fitness center was large with coed steamroom and locker room with limited showers.  They offered bicyles, treadmills, stairsteps, and dumbells. They have a Italian and Japanese restaurants on site.  I didn't eat at either one of these, however, there is a extensive food court outside the hotel that feature seafood and local cuisine.  The most appealing was they sell 1 liter of beer for about $4.50 a bottle.  Most beer costs about $10-11 dollars for a 450-500 ml bottle.  This hotel is located near the marina and golf course next door across from the ferry that takes you to several islands.  Down the street from the hotel is several beachside resorts with no beach for swimming but it was a very nice area around the hotel.  Overall, I had a very comfortable stay at this hotel.  The room sitauation was irritating and I think the staff need to be more forthcoming about what's going on with the rooms.  I think this hotel offers a better value than some of the hotels in the city for $200 a night.  Becareful with their upgrades--they might not be quality upgrades.

This time, we were told that the room we had booked was unavailable and that we were therefore being upgraded, although only twin beds were available in the upgrade. When we got to the room it was clear that we had been duped as we were in exactly the same room as we had been on the previous visit so we knew it was the type of room we had booked, and had been lied to simply to get round the fact that no double beds were available
The other problems with the room were that we could not adjust the temperature of the air conditioning and so had to turn it off because we were both freezing cold. Also the water in the shower would not heat up despite running it for ages, so we both had to have a lukewarm shower. There have obviously been problems in the hotel recently as there were notices everywhere asking that complaints be drawn to management attention. However we were unable to do so without joining a huge queue at reception which we didn‚Äôt have time to do.
We love the location of this hotel and so will go back. However, we will make sure they have got their act together before we do so, and be more aware that ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù doesn‚Äôt necessarily actually mean that.

Internet access in the room was free and the speed was very good. It was quiet and I slept very well. I had the breakfast buffet each morning and it was fine. There wasn't really a large selection to choose from but there were enough basic items such as congee, eggs, toast, cereals and fruit. All the other meals I had in the street restaurants nearby as they are excellent value and Singapore is well known for its excellent street food.
The only negative was the central air conditioning was too cold. The thermostat in the room was useless. There was only one temperature, freezing cold; turning up the thermostat had no effect. The only way to get warm was to turn off the AC or crawl under the covers in bed to stay warm. If they are going to put a thermostat in the room, it should actually work, in my opinion!

-Good, medium-sized, clean, slightly dated rooms.
-On-site 7/11 was a perfect alternative to eating in the restaurant and bar if you were looking for a quick drink/snack. Quick takeaways located on same street also were a plus.
-Friendly staff and cool layout of hotel topped off by roof-top pool and golf course views. on a clear day the view was very smart.
-Many free transport options that make the out-of-the-way location much more bearable.
-Quick access to the airport made even easier by the free shuttle.
-Breakfast was too high-volume and reminded me what it was like to travel in Asia during Chinese new year (crazy but not the fault of the hotel!)
-I was admittedly adjusting to my home bias for morning coffee but I'm quite assured in saying that I had possibly the worst offerings in this regard I've experienced in 20+years of travelling. As I was leaving for the airport, I ordered cappacuinno in the bar - it was even worse!

couple,,False,,"Quiet And Lovely Staycation Nestled in idyllic Changi Village, this is an ideal place for a short getaway from hustle and bustle of the Singapore cityscape. And so it was that, after a rather hectic wedding day, my wife and I retreated here for a short stay to rest and recuperate.

Checking in, we were greeted by the excellent front recept staff Jennesa who cheerfully upgraded us to a deluxe room. Within minutes of entering our room, we received a visit from a housekeeping staff, asking us if the room was in order. With such service so far, it paved the way for a truly relaxed stay.

The room itself was excellent in almost every regard. Very clean, well laid out, and very well lit (during the day with sunlight from the windows, or from the lights in the room at night). Good-quality amenities such as toiletries, bathrobes and slippers, coffee and tea making facilities rounded off a homely room experience for us.

We were offered breakfast and executive club options, but did not take them up as there are cheaper food options in the vicinity. But as I write this, and see some of the previous review photos, perhaps next time we will take up the executive club option.

All in all, we love this hotel, and will recommend it to family and friends who want a quiet and lovely staycation in Singapore!",2013-03-01,PreCovid,1
business,,False,,"Thoroughly happy stay I stayed here for one week in March 2013 for work in Singapore.

Location - perfect for access to the airport. the airport is named after Changi Village where the hotel resides. There is not a MRT which is close by so a trip my taxi or bus is the only way to get about if you wish to leave Changi. The village itself is quiet and a nice local vibe is here. the waterfront and boardwalk is a must if you stay, it really is a nice walk along the small harbour and waterfront.

Food - I only dined in the saltwater on the lower floor and found the food very nice, although lacking with the diversity. there is a good buffet on every night which I recommend.

Room - Very comfortable room. plenty of space, good AC and all in all pleasant place to sleep. they feel a touch dated and the view is not much to shout about but if all you are doing is sleeping in the room then perfect.

pool - pool is on the top floor an 'infinity pool' I believe they call it. there is not a lot of room to sit up here so if you come at the weekend, arrive early to secure a sun lounger. the sun disappears from the pool in the afternoon so it can get cold up here (in Singpaore I know!) with the strong sea breeze.

Staff - The staff are the selling point to this hotel. I found them to be very accommodating and friendly.

business,,False,,"Exceptional guest service. I had the pleasure in staying at the Changi Vilage hotel and was delighted and surprised at the very high level of personal service provided by all of the employees, and in particular, one of your guest services employees (Ronald Jansen). When I happened to take a rest night at your property on my way between assignments through Changi airport.

Not only did Ronald provide a welcoming check in, doing exceptionally well to upgrade my reservation to a ""Club Level"" room, but going many levels beyond and assisting me later when I had technical problems with my laptop. As it happens my hard drive had failed. However, when I made enquiries he went out of the way in assisting me, first by arranging for one of his fellow employees to look at my lap top. When it was established it was a very serious problem, he made enquiries and gave me directions to a software/hardware company near by, further assisting me in obtaining a taxi and giving directions to a very good computer hardware/software shop. Whilst they were not able to help me in the short term, Ronald gave me valuable advice and I was able to make contingency plans. He went further and whilst I was away for a week, arranged for my hard drive to be analysed by a data recovery specialist and provided me with options for the recovery of the data (delivering said items in person) and keeping me updated via email and telephone calls (to a satellite phone on a river cruiser), which he did on his own time and at his own cost on his personal mobile telephone).

Ronald went that one step further, and that impressed me with his personal skills and wonderful, clearly heartfelt assistance much appreciated.

I work in the luxury hotel sector on a consultancy basis and most of our clients are five star properties, so am used to high levels of service.

The point being, is that in the thirteen years I have been in this position, I have never had such proactive and helpful assistance from an employee I encountered and I want to commend Ronald, who really impressed, and that from a jaded industry professional impressed me.

The hotel is clearly well run, housekeeping is first rate, the rooms are contemporary, work well and the Club Lounge is staffed by lovely and efficient employees. I would recommend this hotel to anybody having to spend a night whilst travelling through Changi Airport.

When I checked back into the hotel a week later, Bryan Pyin Nyar one of the guest services employees and the bellman (whose name unfortunately escapes me) greeted me like a long lost friend and regular, which provided a thoroughly welcoming experience.

Many thanks from a customer who has been thoroughly ""wowed"". The employees here demonstrated superb empathy and were really proactive, kind & caring.

The hotel location close to Changi Airport with a round the clock free shuttle bus was a great start. The hotel rooms, service and staff were a delightful start and finish to our 6 week trip down under. I had booked a superior room (no breakfast) in advance and was given a complimentary upgrade to executive on the way out. This provided access to the exec lounge with complimentary breakfast, all day drinks and snacks and cocktail hour in the evening (we missed this as we arrived at 9pm). The service in the exec lounge was superb, the staff were so cheerful, helpful and efficient. On our return the first thing I did at check in was to upgrade to exec, it was great value for money and made the homeward bound trip so much better than it would otherwise have been. We received the same great service as on our first visit, no probably better,and enjoyed the fabulous infinity pool, a late check out, cocktail hour with lovely hot buffet food as a bonus and the relaxed shuttle back to the airport.
I have only one criticism of this hotel which I passed on to the staff at check out which was about the excessive algae over almost all the outside of the hotel including the bedroom windows which made the hotel look dirty outside and certainly spoilt the view from the windows. They need to find a way to clean this regularly.

Staff throughout were friendly and accommodating.
The food in the hotel's Saltwater Cafe has a pretty good variety with local specials like satay (bbq meat kebabs with peanut curry) and teh tarik (literally pulled tea). The food center across the road was closed otherwise it is well known among locals for nasi lemak (coconut mik rice with chicken wings, egg, anchovies, etc.)
The hotel has an hourly free shuttle that to and from Changi Airport and also one that takes guests to the MRT (subway) station for access to shopping malls and other parts of Singapore.
This hotel is not in the usual bustling, city which Singapore is known for. It is tucked away in a corner of Singapore near the airport (about 20 min drive) so please be aware of that. It is good for overnight layovers. Those with a day to spare can spend a day exploring Pulau Ubin which is an offshore island nature reserve with wild boar, eagles and other local creatures. Another highlight close by is the Changi Chapel Museum which is located on the site of a World War Two Japanese POW camp for captured British and Australian troops. This is a personal favourite since I was a history teacher and wrote a paper on the Japanese invasion and fall of Singapore.

We took part in the Singapore government tourist scheme which gives discounts if you stay at specific hotels. Took the bus from the SIA office to the hotel which took about 15-20 min. The hotel fascade and reception area was quite nice. The reception staff gave as a teddy bear for our daughter which was very kind of them. The standard room we booked already had the cot set up as we requested. It was reasonable size but had a slightly mouldy smell as other reviewers have said. The decor and furniture were quite old and the walls were dirty. The sink and tub were both slightly cracked. The rooms need to be renovated. However, everything functioned ok and we got a decent night's sleep.

The pool on the 8th(?) floor was reasonably large although we didn't get to use it. The gym was surprisingly well equipped compared to other hotels I've seen.

As mentioned by others, there's no need to eat at the hotel if you don't want to as the hawkers stores are a 5 min walk away and very cheap (and good).

Unfortunately the SIA didn't send a bus for us the next morning as they told us, and we were expected to catch the hotel shuttle bus to the airport, but luckily there were many taxis available and the trip only took just under 10 min and cost around $15 so it wasn't too bad (but I'm still annoyed with the SIA,).",2013-03-01,PreCovid,0

Hotel maintenance
Parts of the hotel are green with algae. Some of the facilities in my rooms (I booked 1x deluxe room and 1x junior suite) were not working, e.g lights and tap.

Service standard
Reasons why I won't be returning to this hotel.
(1) While checking-in, I've asked for 3 complimentary car passes as there were 5 of us and we have 3 cars. Miss Siti, the front desk officer, then whispered to her Malay colleague ""tamak"" (greedy in Malay), not knowing that my friend is Malay. My friend then questioned her in Malay but she denied making such a remark. Even her colleague beside her had a miraculous memory loss!
(2) I also had to move to another room as the twin beds that were promised became a king bed.
(3) Breakfast was not very enjoyable as the staff was overwhelmed by the crowd.

With the opening of Crowne Plaza at T3, Changi Village Hotel is no longer the nearest hotel to the airport. If the facilities are not well-maintained and staff well-trained, I foresee the hotel losing more customers like myself.",2013-03-01,PreCovid,1
couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Great place for short stopover This was my first time to Singapore, so didn't know what to expect from the hotels there. This place was a pleasant surprise and a great location if you are only in Singapore for a stopover for a couple of days due to it's close proximity to Changi International airport. There is a free bus shuttle that takes you to and from the airport which is very convenient for a first timer who has no idea of how taxi's and public transport work in a foreign country. The area (Changi Village) has enough to keep you entertained for the short period you might be there, but the more central part of the city is within relatively close and cheap reach by taxi. There are local food outlets (food hawker centres) as well as a Subway for those not quite ready to try the local cuisine (which is absolutely delicious as far as I'm concerned and well worth a try!!). The beach is within walking distance from the hotel, although I'd rather recommend the 8th floor pool of the hotel for a swim rather than the sea - much cleaner and amazing views of departing and arriving aircraft into Changi. The room we had was very clean and tidy and more than catered for our needs. The breakfast in the mornings offered just about everything from full English, American, Continental as well as local cuisine. If you like spicy fish, then I'd recommend the dish ""Otak-Otak"" - minced fish mixed with spices and cooked in banana leaves.

couple,,False,,"Never ever going back here again My first visit to this hotel was pleasant. I was happy with the infinity pool and the room. The service was good too. However I was not so lucky the second time.

My wife and I were planning a hotel hopping trip. When we arrived at the hotel driveway, my vehicle was blocked by a taxi which parked itself in between 2 lanes. The driver ignored me even though I was waiting for almost a minute. The doorman did not attempt to divert the taxi to one side. I had to horn a few times before the taxi moved away for me to go to the carpark.

Upon checked in, there was no one to help us carry our luggage to the rooms. There was also no one at the lift lobby too.

When we reached our room, we were disappointed with how run-down the room was. The door view hole was so dirty that no one can see anything. The door ledge was faulty. I even cut my finger trying to ledge the door.

That was not the end. The glasses were dirty and the bedsheet was stained. We asked for some cutleries and new glasses over the helpdesk through the phone and were promised that they were delivered in a few minutes. We waited 30mins but nothing came. I called again and was then put on hold by the operator. After a few minutes, the phone hung up! We gave up and ask for a room change but were told it would be only on the lower floors!

Our room came with access to the lounge. The evening spread was pathetic. It seemed under-staffed as it took ages for them to clear our tables.

I wanted to show my wife the infinity pool on the top floor but found that the lights were all off. I called the front desk to understand why it was closed and was told that there was a short circuit by the front desk and we were told that it would not be fixed within the night. Surprisingly, I called to ask for the manager and then found out that someone had forgotten to turn on the light instead. Although the lights were fixed, we were disgusted by the amount of leaf litter in the pool. I wonder if anyone had scheduled a clean-up for it at all for weeks.

Fuming mad, I asked why the front desk lied about this. More lies and excuses but not real apology. It spoiled my holiday. I wanted to bring my wife to a quiet place to relax but we got agitated instead. The manager offered a free night stay but I swore not to come back ever again.

As I only had a night in Singapore and had an early morning flight back to London I thought it would be a good idea to stay here rather then in town (at the start of my trip I was staying at the wonderful Swissotel Stamford).  Big mistake to stay at Changi as the hotel literally felt as if it was in the middle of nowhere!  Plus the hotel is actually just over 20 minutes by car from the airport - might as well have stayed in town (when I was returning back to the hotel from the city even my taxi driver said the hotel was far from the airport!).  By taxi It takes quite a bit of time to get into town and will cost you about $30, all quite a lot of effort when you are supposed to be in one of the most super efficient cities when it comes to ensuring ease of travel.  Unfortunately location wasn't only the downside for this hotel.  I didn't think much of the service either which seemed rather slow and poor compared to the experience in other establishments.  When I checked in at reception I found one of the staff members quite unfriendly, doesn't say much about their customer service.  But the worst experience was when I ordered room service in the evening.  They basically forget my order and after waiting over an hour and speaking to various people who seemed to want to just pass on my calls to someone else, I asked to speak to the duty manager who to be fair did try to manage the situation, but unfortunately the damage had already been done.  All too much to go through really for just a plate of vegetarian fried noodles.

Pros :
- Friendly helpful staff. Good quality service here.
- Free hourly airport shuttle both ways. And a morning and afternoon shuttle to and from downtown.
- The swimming pool is among the best hotel pools I have come across. Not so wide but long enough to really swim in and the view whilst in the pool is exceptional. Over the ocean and Singapore. Swimming towels supplied by the pool.
- Room was comfortable without being particularly welcoming. Average ambience for me.
- Bed was also comfortable with nice linen.
- Good fitness centre on the fifth floor. Lots of machines and weights. Steam room. Lockers, shower, towels and water supplied.
- Breakfast buffet was great. Lots of choice of western and Asian dishes. Everything you'd expect from a good hotel.
- Wifi reliable and fast.

Cons :
- Maintenance. The window of my room was the dirtiest hotel window I've ever seen and I've stayed in some pretty average hotels in India. Algae growing on it. Couldn't really see out where the algae was and there was a lot of it. Mentioned it to reception and they said, ""Yes we're aware of it, it's difficult for the cleaning contractor to access that space."" Say what? How long has this hotel been open for? And they haven't sorted out basic maintenance issues.
Corridor and room walls marked and scratched. Carpet heading towards needing replacement.
- In room lighting was weird. Strange and frustrating switching. And no real reading light.
- Hard to close the curtains because the curtain rail is bent.
- No clock in the room. For an airport hotel this is strange.
- Value. Singapore is expensive but I felt that this hotel is not value for money. At more than $200 SGD the maintenance and quality of fixtures and fittings are average.

Would I stay here again? If I didn't have a better option. 20 minutes by shuttle form the airport so much closer than the downtown hotels. Cheaper than Crowne Plaza which is at the airport.
3.5 stars from me because in spite of the good points, the property maintenance lets it down and consequently the value is not there.",2013-03-01,PreCovid,0

Also popular with offshore contractors and some package tour companies.  I spent three nights here in February 2013 for work.  My room was clean and reasonably furnished (though a colleague on arrival asked for another room as she felt hers was not adequately cleaned).  Breakfasts were very good, with a good range of eastern and western choices.  The rooftop pool is small and no more than two people can swim in it at any one time.  The ground floor pool (unused by me) is slightly bigger.Changi village itself has a few western bars and a selection of shops and is only a two minute walk from the hotel.  Best of all is the 'hawker village' a collection of street food vendors selling virtually every type of cuisine from south east Asia.

family,,False,,"Very impressed, yet again I am writing a review for this hotel for the first time, after it being my second visit at Changi Village. Both times I've stayed at this hotel I only stayed overnight as Singapore was a stopover destination. Each time I have been impressed.

Rooms: I was fortunate to be upgraded from a normal room to a suite room for both stays. The rooms were quite spacious, clean and peaceful. Definitely wonderful to sleep and rest in after such a hectic day. I was very happy with the quality of the rooms.

Service and staff: What I am most impressed and happy with. The staff were very friendly. helpful and hospitable - both room service, wait staff and desk staff. The duty manager was also very friendly and helpful, especially in sorting out some transport issues we had with the Shuttle buses. They treat the guests well and go out of their way to make sure you receive great service you are satisfied with.

Location and scenery: Very nice location and scenery. Although it's not the newest hotel, it is very tranquil and offers nice views.

Food: First time I stayed here, we ate food at the nearby food court (which is walking distance from the hotel) to experience local Singaporian cuisine. Second time I ate here for dinner and breakfast at one of the private lounges which had a very relaxed buffet setting. The food was quite tasty, however with limited options in this private lounge since it was quite small. I can't say anything about the main dining area on the ground floor since I never tried it, but the main dining area is much larger than the private lounge. The staff here though were extremely helpful and generous.

Shuttle bus services: I am glad they have the shuttle bus services to the airport from this hotel. It makes checking out and arrivals to the hotel much easier and smoother, instead of having to wait for a taxi.

Overall, I have to say I really enjoy this hotel, it's location and it's staff and services. I've stayed at quite a few different hotels in Singapore before, but intentionally booked at Changi Village Hotel again after my first stay, since I liked the service and location. The fact that staff and management really look after you and make your stay as easy and comfortable for you as they can makes me want to stay here again.

couple,,False,,"My Weekend Getaway Changi Village has been my weekend getaway for the past year and a half, and I stay at the hotel at least twice a month or so over the weekends to relax and recharge.

I just spent the last weekend here at the hotel and had an absolutely great time. I upgraded my room with access to the Executive lounge (like I always do now) and it was really quite a pleasure. I have written a review about my experience here before, but I feel like I have to write another one based on my stay over the last weekend and my other stays over the past 3 months.

Here are the highlights:

Executive Lounge:
The staff here really put in a lot of effort and it's really nice that they go the extra mile to make sure my stay is more than just pleasant. Since I stay at the hotel at least 2-3 times a month - and the staff by now know me pretty well, they take the initiative to remember my likes and dislikes and I get my coffee and wine exactly the way I like it. I feel a very good vibe here, and the staff are not just staff, I see them, talk to them and get to know them, that are more like familiar friends.

Service Staff:
Specific mentions have to go out to Ben. He has helped me with my meals, helping me arrange for a late check-out, a few months ago. I needed to use the computers pass the closing time, and they were very willing to accommodate. Isfareed, on my last few stays (in Dec 2012 and last weekend), helped arrange my late-check out - while I was dining at the lounge. I didn't even need to go down to the front desk at all - I didn't even need to get my new key cards myself, he arranged for everything and slipped the keys under my door! How much more can I get pampered?

Fitah, one of my faves (who was posted to one of the hotels under the same management) did an amazing job. I noticed that there was a guest causing some problems - but she and her manager, Lynn, handled it very well with high standards of professionalism. Fitah came up to ensure that all the guests were comfortable, at ease, and to make sure everyone was not troubled by the unnecessary commotion. She was very nice, sweet and really put in a lot of effort to ensure that my experience at the Executive Lounge was comfortable. In Dec 2012, when I had dinner on a Saturday there, I was served by her and breakfast on Sunday morning - and on both instances, I had no issues. I am very pleased with the service. Fitah is very easy to talk to, and that sort of sincerity is hard to find in the service business (in Singapore). It has to come naturally. I remember having a really good time talking and laughing with her - and it made my stay more personal, as it really comes down to interacting with the staff, and having a personalised experience. At the end of the day, they are people too, and I enjoyed having conversations and learning tips from them. What a shame, she is at a different hotel now.

Manager:
To the manager, Lynn, thank you again for your useful travel tips, in regards to booking flights online. It was extremely useful. I followed your advice and am sorting out my travel details. The food options are great, from Satay to Meatballs and am a huge fan of the new Coffee/Cappuccino machine. Love all the details in the Lounge, from the decor, music, food and ambiance.

Front Desk:
Really appreciate the level of friendliness and professionalism I always encounter from all the staff at the Executive Lounge, and others like Abraham and Ronald at the front desk. I will be coming back to stay again this weekend, and hope to have a wonderful stay, yet again! ;D",2013-01-01,PreCovid,0

The lobby is dull and lifeless (I prefer a bit of space and vibrancy), the breakfast was just about OK, I would say rate the spread as average. The lunch and dinner at the hotel is not too good too. There are some very nice eating joints close by so it is best to eat at one of these joints outside the hotel. The room I was initially allocated had a strange smell (a bit stuffy and damp) they changed the room but the moment I opened the window of my new room I realized it opened to the gym. That was the last time I opened the window (and I did not have either the energy or the will to change the room). The staff is very businesslike and just about cordial (don't expect them to make small touristy conversations). The closest MRT needs a taxi and at odd hours even taxi's are a problem. The check out process was smooth and the last day they allowed a 2 hour delayed check out. I would not prefer to stay in this hotel again (the hotel apparently has some deals with travel companies so a lot of tourist groups were around on the 1st day of stay - wonder why, I would prefer smaller but better located hotels for leisure travellers.
A Trivia : Apparently a parking lot bang opposite the hotel is a famous pick up joint for Lady boys.

It is a relatively beautiful hotel as this is not the first time that I visit this little gem out of the main city of Singapore. The check in service is prompt and the staff is always helpful with a shuttle service to the shopping malls if you want to shop around. The breakfast is of average standard though but they do have an awesome Italian restuarant that I tried with my partner. But there is this whole row of little eateries just outside of the hotel so you need not worry that you will have to pay a lot for a decent meal compared to the hotels in the city area. Whereas this is near the airport, the rates are fairly decent compared to the one in Changi International Airport which charges much higher and I do not feel that I need to pay more because of this reason.

The hotel has all the necessary amenities and if you fancy a massage to ease your jet lags, then you must try their Spa - The Retreat which will leave you in heaven. Be mentally to pay a little more because of their impeccable services with a view (sea view) to die for.

Its tough to find a hotel in the main land of Singapore and this hotel is certainly a little gem that you will not want to pass of when you visit the little sunny island.

business,,False,,"A decent hotel I stayed here for a few weeks on business, and as far as business type hotels go, it's decent enough with some positive points, and a few negative points - but if you're looking to stay here for something else, then I wouldn't bother - it is quite uninspiring.

From a positive point of view, the rooms are clean, simple, functional and fairly spacious. There are 5 or 6 different restaurants in the hotel, and I would recommend the Japanese restaurant on the ground floor near the lobby, or the Italian on the rooftop with great views of the sea - both were enjoyable meals (I ate at the Japanese restaurant a couple of times a week). The main restaurant where you have breakfast is ok, with lots of buffet stuff on offering, but this gets boring very quickly, and isn't that great... though it does attempt to cover most cuisines of the region, aswell as cover for western palates (though this just makes it kinda boring for me).

Locally there isn't a great deal going on, and it takes a good 20 mins to get into the city centre, so if I were to visit again, I would much prefer to get something more central. (Note: despite the name, it also isn't that close to the Changi Business Park either, so bare that in mind for taxi fares and travel times to/from the office if you're situated in that area). there are some places to eat further down the road, though don't expect a lot from the quality.

There are a couple of pools - I would definitely suggest the one on the roof, rather than the one opposite the restaurant. The gym is ok, and seemed to be fairly quiet most days.

There is also a 7Eleven in the lobby, which has lots of stuff from sweets to toothbrushes, to power adapters, etc. Definitely buy things from here rather than your minibar ;-)

Overall, it was pleasant enough, and I didn't have too many complaints - location is probably the worst feature, but if you're expensing the travel costs, and don't mind the drive, there could be worse places to stay.",2012-11-01,PreCovid,0

When finally reached room, had a shock as the suite is very small! No separate living room, no separate shower area, no cosy room! I'm sure I was checked into a wrong room. Called main office to check (reception was too busy to answer my call), the hotel insisted that I've booked a Executive Club, not Executive Suite and I was told to wait in that room while they check. No reply after 20mins of wait, called the officer again and was told to wait further. Thus I decided to go to the reception with my luggage after another 15mins of wait. Re-queued for another 15mins, recep checked and still insisted that their system showed that I have booked a Executive Club room and not a Suite, although I showed them the hotel voucher which stated clearly on my room type. Finally gave me a suite room after the receptionist went in and out of the office. Very disappointed with the service. I even overheard that many guests were transferred to an apartment at other area as the hotel has ran out of guest room, despite the fact that these transferred guest had already fully paid for their room.

The strip of bars, restaurants and shops is just footsteps from the hotel entrance and has everything you need for a great stay. The stunning sea views offer the perfect backdrop to a relaxing trip. If you want the bright lights of the city centre it's still only 30 minutes away by cab. I guess most people know the hotel as a short stopover spot for transit passengers from the airport. I'm sure it works fine for that but it has SO much more to offer for a longer stay. The rooftop pool is a joy and the fitness centre is well equipped too. The Executive Lounge on the 6th floor is as good as any you'll find anywhere with a great coffee selection, PC access, reading material and a lovely outdoor balcony to enjoy. The rooms are clean and spacious with wonderfully comfortable beds and cool, modern bathrooms. But the real secret to this hotel is the staff. Even though they face high guest turnover with the airport sector they treat each guest with warmth and courtesy and never miss an opportunity to help out or offer a friendly greeting. There's something very genuine about the whole experience and I'd say they make great ambassadors for Singapore. I sometimes travel alone and sometimes with my wife and young daughter but either way these people make me want to come back again and again. A hotel should be welcoming and this one is. Sure, there's a bit of faded paintwork here and there, the corridor carpets are probably due for a change and the exterior facade has some green algae spots that need removing - but forgive those minor fair wear and tear issues and you'll discover a hotel with real heart and soul, a diamond in the rough and a perfect place for that relaxing break you deserve.

Buses 33, 59,2 which all leave from the depot, making it very convenient for the traveler.Now, the hotel. Across the road is Fairy Ponit jetty, and further up Navarethorn road are the Sailing and Golf clubs. Virtually, while having a luscious breakfast the greenery of the course comes in view.All the staff, which includes F/O just excellent and helpful. Thanks Ben, Zaw and Bryon and the lass who checked me in. Well Done. The Saltwater restuarant, house keeping and the porters and Congiere just give you that SPECAIL attention to make you feel at home and welcome.However, note that if you wish to make a reservation go to the site or contact them directly, they say that they will  give you a good deal.Note, though breakfast is not served its added on to your bill. But, if you're had enough of American/Asian hotel fare, just left out of the hotel there are many hawker's that cater for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ie, dimsums, noodles, drinks, curries, paratas, byrianai ad curries. Just YUMM. A good breakfast with parata and a nice strong (Indian coffee) for $3, you're saved and tasted Asian cuisine.Oh Yeah, at night some of the shop also cater Chilli Crab.

I didn't like the hotel buffet so much since it was too crowded (there were other big groups holding meetings at the same time) and the food was not that great.  However, right outside the hotel is a long row of coffee shops and hawker centers that offered terrific local food.  After one breakfast at the hotel, I skipped all meals and just ate from the various food centers outside.  Since the hotel is quite far off, you have to take a bus or a cab to get to the nearest metro stop or just take a cab into the city.

I had previously stayed in Changi Village hotel 2 years ago and was quite pleased with the experience. However, there were several things that left much to be desired during my visit this time:

- Cleaniness of room (Rm 662)
The toilet was decently clean. However, we noticed that the wooden table tops in the bedroom were still dirty with mysterious dried spots on it. Rubbish on the ledge near the bathroom (left by the previous occupant?) was not cleared.

- Service of staff
The check-in staff's service was lukewarm at best. At check-out, the staff just dismissed us with a review card when we told her we wanted to make a feedback regarding our room. This not only reeks of unprofessionalism; it also shows a clear shirking of duties. (Perhaps this is the standard procedure here.)

Nevertheless, I must commend the service of the staff in the Lounge who managed to salvage our experience with this hotel. Otherwise, it would have been a complete ""fail"".",2012-10-01,PreCovid,0

The airport hotels are great for shorter stays but this was perfect for a day stopover, also reason The hourly shuttle didn't work for us on arrival as we just missed it and did not want to wait around. Taxi was cheap anyway. We did use the shuttle next morning and it was brilliant.

Check in was good, lovely friendly young man. Room was basic but everything you need. We were at the back and could see a bit of the golf course, would love to have been at the front and higher up. Very musty smelling, but it is the tropics and no opening windows so to be expected. We couldn't wait to get to the pool and see the view with all the planes coming in. As we both love swimming, and planes, this did not disappoint. (Only complaint were some children jumping and diving in and not looking, luckily no one injured and this is something the hotel is not responsible for but the parents.)

We were there on a Saturday night so walked down to the beach and were amazed at all the people around, camping, running, biking, having BBQ's etc. Just so alive.

Would love to stay at this hotel again but for a few more days to check out Changi Museum and take a ferry ride to one of the Islands, and spend a lot more time at the pool.

- Inside the bathroom I found only one towel and found another USED WET TOWEL inside the wardrobe!!!! It is totally unacceptable to a quality hotel

This hotel is very wheel chair and pram unfriendly with many staircases. After we parked our car, we have to push our pram over this flight of stairs before we can take the life. The sign to the lift lobby should display clearer instructions for wheelchair users which level to park to avoid the steps. This happened twice after I re-entered the carpark and parked at a separate level which require me to go over the stairs again.

Check-in was very fast, staff was professional too. Howver was very disappointed when the staff told me that the rooftop swimming pool was closed for renovation. One reason I came to the hotel was the rooftop swimming pool which can allow my young kids to play in and view the planes. The other pool was near the cafe and seemed much deeper so I forgo the swimming experience totally. Management should have put a notice in the hotel website to inform the guest prior booking. I only booked the room three days prior check-in and didnt see any such notice. So felt short-changed.

I was quite disappointed when I entered the Delux room as it had no view. Not like the hotel pictures. Open the windows and you can only see two walls and trees. Very obstructed view with the walls protruding. However the good thing is privacy as you can open the windows and no one can peep into your room. Decor looked a bit dated on first view but on careful look actually the furnishings are not that old.

Bathroom was ok, with a transparent window to the room, good for monitoring the kids. As written by another reviewer, it is indeed a bit tough to shower the kids as the bath tub is very slippery. My two year old daughter slipped once in the tub. The only safe way was to have an adult sitting in all wet to bath the kids. But the shower and rain shower temperature was very easy to control, which is good. Aircon temperature can be adjusted easily too so kids wont catch a cold, better than some other hotels with perpetually freezing temperatures no matter how you adjust the aircon.

Housekeeping was very efficient as the lady sent the baby cot to our room within five minutes of booking in. Much faster than other hotels which take half a day to deliver the cot. The housekeeping lady was also very friendly and efficient to bring in more towels and bed sheets to line the bare baby cot.

For my first 5 nights in Singapore I had stayed at the excellent Park Regis hotel in the city centre (see my other review) but because I was working in the nearby Tampines area, it was recommended I move to somewhere closer and rather than staying at an airport hotel, I booked the Changi Village Hotel. First impressions are that it is slightly tired, but I warmed to it immensely as I spent more time here. I also appreciated the village and coastal neighbourhood in contrast to the bustle of the city.

I was given a 7th floor room with an absolutely fabulous view, looking over treetops out to sea, lovely to wake up and see big tankers sailing past! Room perfectly fine, large and with big bathroom. Public areas also good - but I just felt, professionally as an architect/ interior designer, that it could do with a bit of a spruce up, it's obvously a very busy hotel, with lots of people passing through especially due to proximity to airport and it needs some updating - as it is such a comfortable hotel in so many respects.

Staff couldn't have been more helpful and professional, especially as I was a solo traveller. Very nice to be greeted and asked about my day when returning in the evening. Wifi reasonable cost and breakfast good value if booked in advance and very plentiful. Less impressed with the Italian restaurant on the 8th floor, seemed very expensive and surely this should have been a really fabulous destination? 8th floor roof top swimming pool absolutely lovely, it was just missing a pool side bar!

With regards the neighbourhood, I had heard a lot about the local Hawker Centre which is unfortunately closed for refurbishment at the moment, but I do recommend a walk to the beach and the bistro bar there is lovely, with great staff and a perfect place to enjoy sunset (and planes coming in very low over the sea).

So in all, I had a great stay at the Changi Village Hotel, so much so I would certainly stay again if I should return for work in Tampines - it's a bit far away from the city centre to stay if working there as takes over an hour on the bus / MRT. Cost as all Singapore, fairly expensive but in line with other hotels.

Keep in mind that the location can be a plus or a minus depending on what you need - it's a good 10-15 minutes to the airport by cab and maybe 30 mins to downtown Singapore. The MRT doesn't come to Changi village so take public transport you need to take a bus and then the MRT.

family,,False,,"Recommended for couples and families with older kids. Not advisable for families with small kids I just stayed at the deluxe room with my 3 little ones, 3.5yrs, 2 and 9 mths after grabbing the weekend offer of a free extra bed and breakfast.

It was unfortunate that when I checked in, the hotel was doing maintenance so the water from the taps was brown. I had to wait until 6pm before the water could run clear. The hotel didn't offer any form of compensation or apologies. I guess it was just my luck.

Anyway, this aside, I feel that the hotel is comfortable for couples and families with older children. It's also good as a cheap alternative as an airport hotel (compared to the Crowne at the airport). This is definitely not recommended for families with small children like mine.

Let's start with the room.

The size of the room was fine for a deluxe and the price. Even with the extra bed it didn't feel too claustrophobic.

The bath was annoying. They had the rainshower, regular shower and the bath tap all at the bath tub. The direction of water was controlled by a dial with no instructions and doesn't work. Regardless of where I turn the dial, all 3 will be turned on at the same time. The only difference was the strength of water at each outlet. Everything was positioned in such a way that there's no way I could stay dry while showering my children. By the time they were done, I was drenched. Since I can't draw the bath curtains while showering my children, the bath mat was soaked by the time I was done bathing them. In fact a small pool of water was gathering. Very slippery and dangerous. I called the housekeeping for an extra bath mat which they brought very quickly and courteously. Luckily for that.

The tub was stained with black circles and there was no non-slip mat provided. My 2 yr old slipped and knocked her head twice and my baby went under the water while sitting. With that experience, I dare not let them soak. I showered them instead and this time, I almost slipped myself because I had to move around the bath tub while showering the kids.

The extra bed they provided was terrible. It was so painful to sleep on. My husband took the bed and the next day, there were markings of the shapes of the metal springs on his back. The main bed was comfortable. The pillows were too high for the children but comfortable for the adults. It's a pity they didn't have a variety of pillows.

The kettle was on the table which is easily accessible via the chairs and the sofa seats attached. The other alternative place to boil water was at the console under the TV, which was dangerous because we're not sure if the TV will be spoilt. It was stressful trying to boil water with kids around.

Other than that, the housekeeping was good and friendly. They saw that we had kids and gave us one extra towel, box of tissue and toilet roll. Gave us an extra bottle of water too.

Food around the hotel was terrific. Recommended for an F&B/R&R kind of getaway for couples. The beach is nearby and there's always the choice to take the ferry to Pulau Ubin for some cycling.

The most awesome part of the stay for the children were the pools. The rooftop pool provided terrific views and the children enjoyed watching the planes fly over. The pool at the ground floor, which curiously was only accessible through the cafe, had glass panels which would allow people to see what the people in the pool were doing. I would have taken my kids there but the pool was deep. We weren't comfortable monitoring out kids where our feet cannot touch the floor so we didn't try out the pool. It was a pity. Would have been a very good photo opportunity.

The gym was very clean and well-maintained. I just felt that since there was some space available, they could put a small outdoor play area for the kids.

Food wise, the restaurants provide very good food. I know because I've eaten at the hotel before. However, breakfast was surprisingly mediocre in terms of food quality. The omelette was very bland and even then we had to queue 10 mins for it.

I probably would not return to this hotel unless I'm going for a spa retreat or a couples getaway with my husband.",2012-06-01,PreCovid,1

As the name says, it is in Changi Village, a small village with lot of options to eat right next to the hotel.

Hotel: This is not a business class hotel, a quick stop over or one night sleep might work pretty well. But remember, hotel rates in Singapore are very high and there is lot of demand. I stayed at this hotel on my recent trip and was Ok. The breakfast was included in my rate and it was good...lot of options: Continental and Asian. There is nothing to go wrong with the breakfast selection. The hotel has also a decent bar and do not forget to taste the Singapore Sling cocktail. There is also a roof top swimming pool and is nice.

Room: A small size room with queen bed, office desk, chair, decent lighting, refrigerator, lcd tv. I'm not a big fan of the low profile bed and it is not very comfy. There is one power outlet that fits most of the international adapters which is very good because I forgot to carry mine with me. The bathroom has a soaking tub and the shower head is great, however, the shower curtain and the design how the shower curtain covers the tub is bad, hence the water spills all over and the floor gets wet. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom and that is no good.

There is a beach area a short distance away, pleasant enough for a stroll on a fine day but it is slightly scruffy and under the airport flightpath.

couple,,False,,"Changi Village ‚Äì Great location, great place for smokers I stopped at the Changi Village for one night ‚Äì not because I was on an overnight stopover, but because I wanted ‚Äì I come to Singapore every year, and always wanted to check the area; it is completely different from the downtown area. You have a chance to walk around the ‚Äúhousing states‚Äù (they do not have the same connotation of American housing projects, Parisian banlieus, or British council states), eat in one of the many local eateries (please note that the hawker center is closed until the end of 2012), and just spend the night like a local. The hotel is one street from the beach, where you can go for a 6km run on a mostly shaded pathway.

So, the location did not disappointed. The hotel is what you would expect: business hotel, friendly, clean (with the caveat below), good sized rooms, a very nice shower, overpriced restaurants, overpriced breakfast, and a beautiful pool on the top floor.

These are the positives, and they are more than enough for the regular stopover, but there are a few things to consider:

1. Location: It is great, but the shuttle takes its time to get from Airport to Hotel. The free hotel shuttle leaves from T2 and T1. If you arrive on T3, you will need to go to T1. From terminal 1, the shuttle takes 25 minutes to get to the hotel. So, not much quicker than going to town using the metro, if you know your way around. I would suggest taking a taxi to the hotel. (The shuttle took 15 minutes on the way back)
2. If you are a non-smoker, and don't tolerate sleeping on an ash-tray, don't bother. The ‚Äúnon-smoking‚Äù rooms are sprinkled around smoking ones and they smell equally bad. I was given a smoking room by mistake, changed to a non-smoking, and it makes no difference. Room 404 is non-smoking, but rooms 401, 402, 403, 405, and 406 are smoking, so you get the picture: carpet smells, bed-sheets smell ... it is not pleasant. A big chain like this one should be able to make entire floors smoke-free, or, at least make sure that the carpet of non-smoking rooms are washed, and that all the items (towels, pillows, sheets) of non-smoking rooms are separated from the rest. Otherwise, what is the point?
3. $15 for internet access. This is a standard on all hotels from this chain (‚ÄúFar East Hospitality‚Äù). These are good hotels, but for the life of me, I don't get it. Cable and all utilities are absorbed in the room price, it is time wifi is treated as such.

To summarize, as much as I enjoy the village and the run on the beach, I would not come back to the hotel. I would much rather stay at the Parc Sovereign, Ibis, or Albert Village, all easily accessible on the Bencolen area, or at the Mercure Roxy, on the East Coast (also near the beach) for a one night stopover.

family,,False,,"A decent transit hotel We stayed at the Changi Village Hotel for one night in March 2012 on transit through Singapore.

The hotel is about 15 minutes from the airport. There is a free shuttle bus running once per hour, but the timings weren't great for us on arrival so we just grabbed a cab ($15). On return, the bus worked well for us and is a good feature of this hotel.

Check in was very slow, and I assume that there was a problem with our reservation. We were eventually given keys to a room on the 6th floor.

The room was small, with two single beds. The fit out was reasonably modern but not terribly inspired. The room had a large screen TV, a small desk and an easy chair. The bathroom was pretty standard, but the step-in bath/shower would be an issue for guests with mobility issues. There was a large amount of plumbing noise from others rooms, and coupled with outrageously loud aircon this seriously impacted sleep quality.

Internet, which was included in our package, was wireless, easy to connect to and fast.

I had a session in the gym (couldn't sleep with all that aircon noise!), and it was actually pretty nice. A good mix of modern equipment and a small selection of free weights. The pool, located on the roof, was stunning.

Breakfast, again included in our package, was not served until 6.30am - not ideal in a transit hotel where people are taking early flights. It was probably not worth bothering with anyway, without being too bad.

The area around the hotel seems to be a dormitory style place servicing airport workers. There were some great little restaurants and bars that seemed to be open pretty much 24 hours. Nothing fancy, but a good cheap local meal.

Overall, this is a reasonable transit hotel located a little further from the airport than would be ideal. I wouldn't consider it for anything other than a night between flights, but it was a decent enough transit option.",2012-03-01,PreCovid,0

I wasn't sure if because I had booked under a corporate promotion which allowed for a very late check out, thus i was given a room that was on the extreme far end from the lift and had a terrible view that is blocked by pillars.

Being a regular patron and never seen such a room that is not up to expectations, I requested for another room. The staff, Mr Hairul, was very prompt in making the arrangements to ensure that my request was made and a room was quickly made available to me.

Although, after checking into the new room for about an hour, we realised there were some problems with the pipe. The staff was very apologetic and made it a point to quickly help us change to a better room. Due to the incoveniences, they gave us an upgrade to a nice room and the staff who served us, Mr Ronald, was very professional when helping us with it.

Although we did have hiccups when we first checked in, we feel their professional service made up for all the problems that occured. I had stayed in this hotel many times and love the location which is so near to the beach.

couple,,False,,"Checked in to an already occupied room!!! Yes, you read the title correctly. We were checked into a room that was already occupied. That's the first time I have ever had that happen (and hopefully it is the last!).

Me and my girlfriend decided to do a ""stay-cation"" here for one night. We were kind of sick of the typical, downtown Singapore hotel in the CBD or Orchard area so we chanced upon this place. The location is quite nice, peaceful and tranquil with quite lovely views from the top and the pool deck. You definitely feel ""away"" from Singapore.

When we arrived, nobody was there to open the door of the taxi and the check-in queue was long with only one staff member on-hand handling check-ins and check-outs it seemed. A second staff member arrived but the check-in process took all of about 10 minutes with lots of waiting. Not a good start.

Got our room, proceeded upstairs to the room, inserted the key card and....SHOCK AND HORROR! The room was already occupied; thankfully nobody was there at the time, but the lights were on, there was clothes/laundry hanging from the bathroom and the bed was all messy. It also smelled a bit like smoke even though it was a non-smoking room/floor. The room was also much smaller than what we had booked. We were literally in shock...the look on my girlfriends face was one that I honestly have not seen before (or since).

Went back downstairs and were quite angry, its really quite hard to make a mistake like this. Told the staff member what happened...he looked a bit stunned and mumbled ""huh?! oh..ok!"" and then I told him he needed to make up for this somehow. They offered free internet as compensation. Sorry, but that ain't going to cut it; free internet? Are you nuts? I live in Singapore, I have my iphone with me and I can tether the internet...got no use for that and for someone that just checked us in to an already occupied room the best he could do was free internet?!! I told him that wasn't going to work. He paused for a bit, then offered us free breakfast which we accepted.

Finally got the new room to which we proceeded to. With a bit of trepidation, we inserted the key card to our new room. *PHEW* nobody was occupying the room. The room was spacious and big, but it felt horribly dirty - dirty carpet, hairs on the ugly yellow leather couch attached to the wall and the work desk had some weird stain on it (like the varnish was removed or something). The bathroom WAS CLEAN thankfully, and the water pressure of the shower was FANTASTIC but it left a sopping mess on the floor of the bathroom.

The room overall wasn't as nice as we expected it would be; the photos on the hotel website are a bit misleading in my opinion; I am well aware that hotel photos that are professionally done tend to glitz things up a bit but I just felt like what is portrayed and marketed falls way short of what you actually get.

After getting settled, we decided to venture around and down to the pool for some lunch. It's set up nicely against the golf course, and the food is rather decent. We later went up to the pool which is quite honestly the only redeeming quality of the hotel. The rooftop pool offers beautiful views of Pulau Ubin and Malaysia, and of the airport as well which surprisingly wasn't loud at all and didn't wake us once when asleep.

The breakfast the next morning wasn't something we would pay for, we woke up a bit tired and sore and after a bit more hanging around, checked out.

All-in-all, it was a bad experience from the moment we checked in. Imagine what would have happened if the room we were initially given that was occupied actually had the person inside of it when we flung the door open? That would have been horrible...staff at this place needs some training I think. With all the software these days it is beyond me that they assigned us a room that was already occupied.

It was only a little late 10 mins so not much time to have to wait, arrived at hotel and checked in swiftly and painlessly.

Room is neat and tidy but looking a little old around the edges, for a business hotel needs to spruce it up a bit. Room service was prompt and polite, wifi is very good in the room @ a cost of $24.95 / 24hrs is fairly good. There is a business centre ( of sorts) behind the check in desk and is free to use for guests so use it to print out tickets and information for your on ward journey.

Getting to the city is about $18 in a taxi ( get a blue one as they seem better) Be carefully as all express charges or tolls are charged to you a separate meter is up on the dash so works out about $26 in and $18 back to the hotel. If you want to brave it and go cheap you can use google maps and it tells you where and when you can catch a bus from, you have to change half way there but it is well worth it for only a few dollars.

Check out the local eateries in the area as there are some good deals to have a nice meal.

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Good value stopover for solo traveller I stay here for stopovers on my way to Australia and will stay again if the rooftop pool is not going to be closed. There's an hourly free shuttle bus: leaves the airport at 30 mins past the hour (go to Transport desk for details), leaves the hotel on the hour.
Some things to know:
1. The rooftop pool has a good view, if you don't look behind you at the ducting system which could easily be screened if they bothered. The pool is often closed when booked for private functions (locals like to get married next to the pool) so check before you book if the pool is important to you. There is a ground floor pool also but it has a glass wall, hence diners get an underwater view of the swimmers: OK if you don't mind being watched but not me. You can stay after checkout and use the pool if you have a late flight.
2. Get a 'bumboat' nearby to pulau ubin (10-minute ride) and rent a bike and cycle round the island, which is a nature reserve. A good way to enjoy some exercise between long flights.
3. Local shopping is market-stall quality, OK for cheap stuff, but this is not a place for a good shopping stopover.
4.The hotel food's mediocre and the restaurant staff hurry you if you arrive within an hour before closing time: closing time means the time they go home, not last orders. It's better to eat at one of the many local restaurants, such as a good one just across the road from the hotel, in the Civil Service Club, which has Chinese & Thai food.
5. If you want internet, book a deluxe room: it was a bit cheaper than booking a standard and paying extra for internet. The rooms are the same anyway.",2011-12-01,PreCovid,0
family,,False,,"I like it - but it may not be for everybody.... We stay here regularly as we have family living nearby.  It is peaceful, away from the Singapore hustle and bustle.

We were there over chinese new year this year and got a package with breakfast included (just as well as the tim sum stall was closed) and we enjoyed that.   The rooms are spacious by Singapore standards, and I have found the staff friendly and helpful.

So if it is your first visit to Singapore and you want to see the usual sights, then this hotel is a long way away.   It hasn't changed much over the years - could do with a paint in some parts - but that doesn't bother me because we know the place so well and the rooms all work well.  And the air-conditioner is adjustable - important in Singapore where some hotels can be freezing.

We were told at reception that no double beds available only singles - despite having booked on their website months before with all details confirmed. After repeated computer checking (and no smiles and welcome) there we none available.

We were eventually given the option of a smoking room with a double bed - being non-smokers and having visited many countries and never had a hotel that allowed smoking in rooms, I wrongly assumed that Singapore (being the almost perfect country) must allow it on balconies in some rooms and anyway rooms would be cleaned and deodorised... I assumed wrong - upon opening the door, the stench almost knocked us to the ground - they don't even deodorise the rooms!

When we got to the hotel, we encountered something we had not come across in 3 weeks of travelling in Asia...frosty reception staff.  When we asked the terse young woman at the desk about the Internet so we could check in to our flight, we were told it would be $15 (Sing).  How about printing boarding passes?  Nope, the printer is down.  What about the shuttle bus in the morning?  It goes once an hour...would you like 7 am or 8 am?  We chose 7 and were told to be in the lobby by 6:50.  In the morning, we were in the lobby at the appointed time and found that the shuttle bus was already full.  There is no luggage compartment on the bus, so bags and cases are stacked up on the seats.  Four of us were left behind.  When we complained to the doorman, he said that the hotel doesn‚Äôt guarantee the shuttle, it is only a courtesy.  So in addition to paying too much for poor service and a very average room, we also had to take a cab to the airport.  We can‚Äôt recommend this hotel to anyone else.",2011-11-01,PreCovid,0

My one concern is the way they presented a ""new"" package on arrival for a single executive room currently still being promoted on the web. In fairness, they allowed an early check in (which was great since I was tired). However, that's also when they handed me a printout with new (shorter) lounge snack offerings (1800 to 2000h), two complimentary laundry items (non-accumulating) which I was barely able to do since laundry was leaving the hotel as I arrived (prior to 11am), and complimentary local calls. What I did not find out until I inquired later is: no welcome fruit basket was offered, complimentary items from the minibar were now all charged (but still mostly free in the executive lounge), and the Saltwater Cafe breakfast was withdrawn and the executive lounge breakfast offered in its place. I was told management changed but the ""contract"" with Expedia had not been updated. I asked for clarification about the timing of these changes (since my booking was a recent one), the answer was a vague ""earlier this year"". I would (&, in future, will) not consider booking the executive floor package because I found the lounge annoyingly cold. I spoke to the attendant when she came over to my table to ask if everything was OK. ""Well yes, but it is really cold in here."" ""Sorry I can't do anything about that.""

I found the hotel to be very clean, the bar was decent, and the restaurant had pretty good food. My main issues with the hotel are the way that hotel wireless is managed outside of the room. One must purchase a coupon or ticket to even be wireless if in the bar or restaurant. This is a step backwards for most guests since most hotels extend wireless coverage for guests throughout the facilities. I strongly recommend that the hotel management reconsider this. Secondarily, many flights I had required me to depart on the 6am bus/shuttle. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is not open at 6am so I could not take advantage of the breakfast that my company had purchased or included. Strongly recommend management change this as well. Finally, the rooms are a bit too clean and impersonal to me. I would prefer some touches such as a softer or more personal touch to the rooms that would contribute to making them more personable.

We booked at the Changi Village Hotel because we discovered that we were in Singapore at the time of the F1 Grand Prix, and hotels in the city were either fully booked or too expensive. So, with a few misgivings, we booked here - those misgivings not helped by the fact that we had to pay, in full and with no possibility of a refund, in advance for our 2 nights.

What a surprise! Certainly, we were on the executive floor with its breakfast, and 2 hours of drinks and nibbles each evening, but that had no bearing on the pleasant checkin, the assistance when we required it, or the friendly checkout with the young man then coming outside with us to get a taxi to the airport as the timing of the free shuttle bus didn't suit. There's free wifi, plus free use of a business centre computer to print out your airline boarding passes.

Anyway, we'll be in Singapore for a night in a few months - and we'll stay, again, at the Changi Village, but not on the executive floor as the whole family is coming next time.

A word of warning (nothing to do with the hotel): if the next cab on the airport taxi rank, the one you'll be using, and is big and black, DON'T TAKE IT. It'll cost at least twice as much as an ordinary cab (and shouldn't be allowed into the taxi rank in the first place).",2011-09-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel has a free shuttle bus but it comes to the airport only once per hour to terminal 2 and if you miss it, you can't call the hotel for them to come get you.  You either have to wait the hour or catch a taxi.  Also, it is not located near the MRT.We arrived at the hotel after 11 pm (closer to midnight) and were unpleasantly surprised and irritated at the slowness of their check-in process.  There were only two ladies at the counter but several (or so it seemed) bellmen waiting to help carry the guests' luggage to their room.  They seemed to sense the annoyance of everyone in line (approximately 6 or 7 individuals / couples) and looked like if they could have they would have jumped in to help any and all of us. We had originally booked online and requested a double bed or larger however when we arrived to the room, there were two twin beds!  So we trudged downstairs to get another room with a better bed arrangement.   As we were waiting to get another room assignment, we noticed that another couple who were walk-ins was able to get a room at a cheaper price than what was quoted to us online.  While we were finally able to get a room with a king-sized bed, the aggrevation of securing it as well as hearing that someone else got a cheaper rate for the night irritated us even more.Although our room was fairly clean and roomy, it was such a big disappointment in that the room and furnishings were old and smacked of cheapness!  The wall mounted night stand was about 3 feet from the bed.  The ""nightstand"" on the other side of the bed was more like a built in shelf about a foot off the ground and again several feet away from the bed.The bathroom was ok but as much as we tried to situate the shower curtain, water still leaked onto the floor when taking a shower.  Even the showerhead couldn't be ointed more towards the inside wall of the tub area probably because it was frozen from the stuck-on lime and gunk of the old shower fixture!We had the breakfast buffet which was marginally acceptable with various selections of average quality food.  The only saving grace of the hotel was the exceptional hawker stands across the street on the same side of the street as the Civil Service facility.

friends,,False,,"Excellent Hotel but way too far from the city We stayed at the Changi Village Hotel for 4 nights during the 2011 F1 Singapore GP. Upon check-in, we were told that the room had twin beds and that they did not have any double rooms. We found that pretty odd, since our reservation did not specify twin beds.

We also knew that the hotel was far from the city. But we didn't realize just how long it would take to go to and fro. The hotel shuttle was free and really helped. The drivers were bang on time and refused to wait even for 2 mins. The shuttle bus took 17-20 minutes to the Changi MRT station, and the train to the city took atleast 35 minutes which included 1 change over. So on average, it took atleast an hour to get to the hotel.

We missed the shuttle a couple of times, so it made sense to take the mrt right to the pasir ris station, from where it was a 7 SGD ride to the hotel. This fare went up to 10 SGD during peak hours and upto 13 SGD after midnight.

The hotel itself was good. The rooms were spotlessly clean and in line with a 5 star hotel. However you could hear other guests closing doors in the middle of the night. There was a Seven-11 in the hotel itself from where we could purchase our MRT Ez-link cards which we used extensively on the MRT. There is another Seven-11 across the street from where we could purchase singtel phone cards to call home.

The hotel was good value for money since most 3 star hotels charged 775 SGD for 4 nights during the F1 weekend. Would I stay here again? Probably not, since the travel just took up alot of time.

family,,False,,"Good hotel and service, could do better on connections to the airport I stayed at the Changi Village hotel for one night before a mid-morning flight out of Changi Airport. I moved to the hotel from downtown because I wanted some chill time before my flight, and to be close to the airport so as to minimise transit time.

Getting to the hotel from downtown Singapore cost me about 19 SGD and took 20-25 minutes on a day with little traffic. The other option would be to take the MRT to the airport and then take the shuttle bus to the hotel, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend ages transferring with my heavy luggage, especially because the downtown MRT gets pretty crowded.

Check-in at the hotel was easy and pleasant, with very friendly check-in staff: in general, service at the hotel was definitely gracious and with a smile, which was welcome. The first room I was assigned was on a non-smoking floor, but reeked of smoke, so I requested to be assigned another room, and this was done quickly ‚Äì in a few minutes I was in a new (smoke-free) room.

The room I was given was very pleasant, of a good size, modern, and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were of good quality cotton. The room came with a small sofa alcove and a good-sized writing desk, with a wall-length window. The usual amenities were present ‚Äì coffee and tea, minibar, slippers, shampoos and toiletries ‚Äì but no shaving kit, which was surprising.

The bathroom was also of a good size, very modern and clean. It featured a bathtub with a showerhead for the bath, and a ‚Äòrainforest shower‚Äô from the ceiling. My two gripes with the bathroom was the floor was very slippery when wet, and there was no bath mat to prevent slipping in the bathtub; and secondly, there was a window right next to the bath, which is great if you‚Äôre having a shower or bath alone, but you can also see the toilet from the room if you look through the window, and if you had a spouse in the bedroom he/she could see the more unpleasant things one does in the bathroom! There is, of course, a blind too, which can be lowered in this eventuality.

For me, one of the best features of this hotel is the rooftop pool. The pool was clean and with good views of the sea and of planes on final approach into the airport ‚Äì however, the hotel is far enough away that there was no noise from the planes when I was swimming in the pool. I did not try the gym facilities, but looked at the gym and it looked modern and clean.

One of the other good features of this hotel is the range of food options nearby ‚Äì if you walk out of the hotel and to the right, there are several restaurants serving anything from Malay and Chinese to Western and pan-Asian food, and there are also some bars (but watch out ‚Äì expect to pay a sky-high 9 SGD for a glass of beer or a glass of wine in these places, before tax and service charge).

The only downside to the Changi Village Hotel was its connection to the airport ‚Äì this should be one of the hotel‚Äôs strong points, but the truth of it is, this place does not make much of an effort with regards to business travellers. Why? Here are the reasons:

1. The airport shuttle only runs hourly, which is poor for a hotel so close to the airport;
2. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no shuttle service between 2 and 4am, which is not good for those who fly out on the many early morning flights available at the airport. However, it is easy enough to book yourself a cab ‚Äì the desk is happy to do this and to call you when the cab has arrived.
3. The shuttle bus only goes to terminals 1 and 2, not terminal 3, which is inconvenient.
4. The shuttle service is inflexible on timings. I checked out on the hour, and the shuttle bus was empty, but left about 30 seconds before I could get to it (even though I was the only customer checking out and I was in plain view and clearly hurrying to get the shuttle). Although the check-in clerk was great and hailed me a cab, helping me also with luggage, I would have expected some customer service by the shuttle and not the explanation I was given (I was told that ‚Äòshuttles leave on time here‚Äô), which sounded somewhat patronising. However, I have to stress that staff do not have an attitude problem here ‚Äì the service is great, but keeping to a strict airport shuttle timetable and not delaying by 30 seconds for the only customer who could use the shuttle was too ‚Äòby the rule book‚Äô: after all, a shuttle service is a guest convenience. In the end, I took a cab to the airport, which cost me 13 SGD.

First time was with my friends- we have no problem.love the sea view room,n this was when i fall in love with the rooftop pool facing the sea. So cosy and relaxing.
2nd time, i decided to go with my family, upgraded to executive room, which include a welcome fruit basket. But i did not get it when u check in. So i inform the counter that i did not receive my fruit basket during check out and all he said was sorry bout that.
Thats all????? And he did not even offer to give me one for me to bring home at that time? I decided then not to make a fuss.
That was more last year. This year, i decided to try one more time. Since its my hubby birthday, i decide to have a cosy moment with him so that we can enjoy the pool n jacuzzi together. I requested for a sea view deluxeroom.the staff said it was available.
It was a long checkin at the counter i think the staff is new as he was being coached by another staff.
I got a big shock when i enter the room,it was all messed up and the
room is not facing the sea. We got the wrong room-a room someone just check out from!!! So i use the phone and cal. And i have to go back down to the counter to get a new key from them. Its their fault and why cant he come up and hand the key to me instead??
Me and my hubby are both exhausted coz we are both back from night shift.
So we finally got the room we wanted. Room 720 if im not wrong,
Its not a smoking room but still,it reeked strongly from smoke
smell!!! aNd the best thing is that the next day as early as 7plus am, housekeeper knock on the door calling for laundry!! Im sleeping and thats annoying!!! Waking people up early in the
morning!
Last, my hubby was showerin,luckily i have dress up and was standing infront of the TV when the doorbell ring and before i could
go to the door, a staff came in..And ask me, "" you just check in??"" and i told him, ""no.im checking out soon."" n he say sorry to me.
So may i know what is happening??? Seems all the staffs are confused or something??
Or is there a lapsed in your service?
What if i was standing naked there
when he entered??? And to mean each guest was given 2 keys, the staff dont even know that someone has check in the room? And they can just opened the door with an extra 3rd key?

So on a recent trip to India we decided to break up the trip with a one night stopover in Singapore both on the way over and on our return, which allow us to visit relatives there. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to and from Changi Terminals 1 & 2 to the hotel so we didn't have to queue up for a taxi after our late arrival. The short bus ride and the quick checkin about 10pm was most welcome. The room was clean & neat if not overly large, and as it faced the airport there was a bit of aircraft noise but not enough to prevent a good nights rest. Checkout the following day was just as efficient followed by the free shuttle back to the airport. On our second visit we arrived early in the monring after an overnight flight from India. Due to previous e-mail correspondence with the front office manager Hairul Bin Anis checkin staff we aware of our need for early checkin. Initially, the only room available was a smoking room which we declined. Fortunately another room became available but was one designed for a disabled person. After a long overnight fight without much sleep we didn't care as long as we could get some sleep and have a shower. Later that day my wife used the roof top swimming pool but couldn't remember our room number. When she attended the lobby the staff told her the room number, but then apologised saying that the disabled room was not really suitable for able bodied guests. Within 30 minutes we were moved a luxurious corner room which was nearly twice the size. I had noticed some of the negative comments posted about this hotel on Trip Advisor before booking it for two nights, I don't regret my decision for doing so.

family,,False,,"If you are in transit needing a place to chill out, this is it. Once I arrived in Singapore airport (Changi), I walked to the Hotel Reception area of terminal 1 arrival hall, and asked someone at the info counter for the free bus transfer to Changi Village Hotel. Alas, I was 5 minutes late. I think the bus goes every hour at half hour. I was not patient to wait for the next bus, so I took the taxi instead. It costs around SGD 13 to get to the hotel. There is only one hotel in that part of town (north east of Singapore, right opposite Ubin Island ferry terminal).

The taxi driver assured me that only westerners would go to that hotel, because there is no shopping, and no nightlife. There is, however, good seafood so he would take his family once a week to feast in Changi village. I thought that was enough reason for me to stay there since I was only in-transit for one night. So if you are the type who do not mind peace, you go there.

The hotel is fairly standard Asian international hotel. So internet is not free. They do have a deal where internet costs SGD1 but the package I bought did not include this. It is not cheap but it is also not the 88 or 99 hotel you find in Singapore, which i am surprised is allowed because those tiny 88 or 99 hotel rooms may not have a window. This one, on the other hand has a great window view of the sky and sea!

Yes, the hotel is located very close to the beach. It is not on the beach, but is close enough so that from the top floow swimming pool (don't be fooled by the ground floor pool thinking that is it!) you have a sweeping view of the sea and of the very many planes that land in Changi. You can't hear the noise so don't worry about it.

The rooms are spacious by Singapore standard. Though in my room for some reason the water from the air-condition (it was a rainy day) leaked through the ceiling and I had rain right outside the bathroom. The maintenance people fixed it promptly.

Also, there seems to be a lot of hotel room smokers in Singapore. I asked for a non-smoking room and when I entered, the room smelled of cigarettes. But then again perhaps I did not give them time to air the place properly because I asked for an early check-in and got it!

The pool is a big plus. It is fenced by glass panels on one side so you have the view of the sea and the islands beyond Singapore. And on one end you have a jacuzzi you can switch on. There are also deck chairs and you can just doze off. It is a shame that the management does not block the half a dozen huge air-cond compressors standing on the roof with something green and pretty, because they some one make you realise the ugliness of any top floor of a functional building.

Breakfast costs SGD20 (++?) but don't worry if you want to pay less because there is a big hawker centre (aka food court) within walking distance and it serves beautiful banana leaf rice, char koay teow, nasi lemak, satay or anything Asian that might fancy you. It also has many juice stations and for a mere SGD 2.50 or less you can get a freshly pressed mango juice, calamansi with sour plum juice, apple beetroot carrot juice, or the usual sugar cane or ever popular fresh coconut with juice intact.

Close by there are walks you can do, but I suggest you take the ferry (SGD 3) to Ubin Island and then rent a bike to get to the mangrove swamp. I was short of time so the bike owner gave me a 50% discount of the day rate for a 1 hour bike rental, which I thought was a good deal. Just follow the crowd and you will get there. The water is clear and you can see fish swimming in there! Of course you have your usual coconut palm, jack fruit tree and all kinds of tropical fruit lining the way which makes it look like a typical Malay kampung.

You can't fault this place for anything. It is perfect as an in-transit destination. Oh, if you ache for the city, there is a public bus that takes you there right outside the hotel as well. Just ask the friendly locals and they will tell you. It will probably takes you 1 hour on the bus, but you will eventually get there.",2011-05-01,PreCovid,0

couple,,False,,"Changi Village: Diamond In The Rough! This is the first hotel that we stayed at during our honeymoon. I had some reservations on booking a hotel with some pretty nasty reviews posted on TripAdvisor. Glad to say, our worries were unfounded!

The decor of the hotel is nice and modern, while not being garishly trendy. The facility was up kept nicely and the room was extremely clean, although some furnishing were a little worn out. We weren't expecting a five star facility and this suited our needs perfectly.

We didn't eat in the hotel, as there was a local food court less than a hundred meters from the entrance. The food there was much better, in my opinion, than what you can find in the hotel's restaurant (to each his own). The food court (hawker centre) opens at 5:30 AM in the morning, so you can get chow as pretty early in the morning to fuel the excursions into the downtown area.

A point of contention with the rest of the reviewers is regarding the airport shuttle. It did its job admirably and took us to the Changi Airport T3 for the underground MRT ride to the rest of the country. The MRT ride is about 20 minutes, although it can get steadily more and more crowded as people are picked up along the way, so grab on to a seat and stick to it!

The pool area is nice and is a great way to unwind after a tiresome day exploring the country.

Overall, my impression with Changi Village is extremely positive and will unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who wouldn't mind a short minibus and MRT hop into the city. Cheers!

I couldn't face that long at the airport, even staying at the windowless transit hotel, so I was very glad when I was told Changi Village could accommodate me for a very reasonable day rate. A short cab ride, swift check-in including up-grade to a king bed and I was asleep within an hour of touching down. The hotel is a great spot to rest and recharge in between flights. The staff were super helpful and the room was fantastic and very quiet.

I had read a previous review talking about how good the showers were with some scepticism, but they truly are devine! As for the location, it couldn't be better for those in transit. 15-20 mins from the airport and with an hourly shuttle bus too. While the hotel has a few restaurants we decided to check out the local food spots just a few hundred metres away, and had enjoyed some fantastic yum-cha.

The room was filthy, the carpet was nasty, and there were cigarette holes in the furniture.  The desk had big gouge marks on it that has been filled in with wood putty (not well done); the bottom of the tub was black.  The room was so small it was ridiculous.  There was not a single decoration the walls either, just this dirty yellow paint.  The hotel is huge so the room was extremely far from the elevator.  I went back down to the desk and told them that I would not stay in the room.  They apologised and gave me another room (5th floor).  I also asked about the internet and they said they would wave the fee for my inconvenience (27$ US/ 24h).  Apparently they had up graded me to a suite.  The room was the size of a normal room, nothing special.  It did have a nice big tub and a walk in shower, and the room looked cleaner.  Don‚Äôt make a decision on what you first see.  Turns out the tub faucet did not work (could have filled it using the little shower head but that would have taken hours).  The internet was so slow I could not get my e-mails to load.  Still no decorations on the walls the same yellow paint that need to be redone.  The carpet needed to be cleaned, and it turns out there were these little bugs walking on the work desk.  There was a nice big TV in the room; unfortunately there where only a few channels and they had so much snow on them that it made it hard to watch.  For some reason, the toilet would flush by itself every 10 minutes or so.  That is above the sound of the planes flying over head every few minutes (in the direct flight path of the airport).  When I checked out (5:45am) I told them that I had not been able to get the internet to work and that the tub faucet did not work.  I also told her about the bugs walking on the work station.  She told me that I just did not know how to use the tub.  As far as I know it should not be hard, turn the knob and the water comes out?  No matter what I tried it would not work.  She said they could not be held responsible for the speed of the internet (why not, considering the price it should be able to load e-mails).  She told me that she had never heard of there being bug in the hotel and maybe I had been mistaken.  Trust me there was no mistake.  She did tell me that she would inform somebody so they could fix the problem for the next guest.  That did nothing to help me.

I used concierge services and also didn't have any problems.   The room itself was colder than I would like, there was no manual control over the air-conditioner, either on or off only. Bathroom floor is very cold, and the shower is designed in a way that the water falls down the floor on the floor drain (same thing happened to my colleague in the other room), so about a third of the floor  would be wet after taking a shower.

Although  breakfast was not included I still had it over the weekend and it was very good. What I liked the most at Changi Village Hotel is its location.  It's not even close to downtown Singapore so the neighborhood has its own calmer, quieter  pace.  Bad part is that there's no subway near by so you need to either rent a car (very expensive) or take taxis,buses to get to know the city; good part is that they are well structured and well signed.  If you want to be close to the city center do not choose this hotel.  The surroundings of the hotel are filled with Singapore local dining places.

I asekd for a balcony but there wasn't one - very few rooms have one. The bqth can be a bit tricky to fill without climbing in it to turn taps on, but great over bath shower. Executive lounge free breakfast (limited selection but fine for a quick feed) included in room rate, as are 1800 to 2000 drinks and nibbles - the latter disappointing and the hot food was tepid - wine not good quality and white not cold enough, but selection of beers and spirits good. Free wired broadband in room rate and quite quick too. Selection of bars and restaurants, a good wine bar and the buffet, although pricey, will satisfy everyone's taste as the selection is vast. However cheap, authentic local food abounds - huge selection in market over the road - so go for that if you've any sense of adventure! Good rooftop pool, friendly and very helpful staff (wonderful lady host in the exec lounge), spacious public areas incluidng outside space.

It has a lovely rooftop pool, and its location is either (i) conveniently close to, but not part of, Changi airport, close to some great local food options, and near to waterfront beaches, walks, and bumboats, or (ii) a long way from town, in an almost-rural backwater, with not much to do apart from eat and hang out.  That works for me, but if you're going to stay here, think about the location - it'll either be perfect for you, or really inconvenient!  There's no easy public transport nearby, and you'll use taxis if you need to get around, but they're easy to get.The details:  Check in and out were uneventful, and generally the service was fairly friendly but unexceptional (about par for Singapore).

If you like local food, there are some spectacular dining options within a 2-3 minute stroll (no tablecloths, airs or graces, just great food); there's an ok beach 5 minutes' away, a really pleasant seafront boardwalk, and the bumboat station to shuttle you to Pulau Ubin if you like.

Daily newspaper are free, but not as frequent as the concierge forgot my room number, so I had to go get it every morning!

Forget about using their Internet as it is not high speed as it is, more like crawling the Internet and it is not cheap! (SGD19 for 3 hours!). There is a golf course just outside of the hotel, so if you're into golfing, this is a good place to be.

Because of the location, most of your transportation is via Taxi or bus (if you know what route you are going). The hotel provides shuttle bus to the airport free!

Location wise, it is near to Changi Airport (they have a new Crowne Plaza Hotel).

Nothing beats Crowne Plaza which is just next to Terminal 3, but it lacks of the local food surrounding it, so your best bet is if you want to do over night in Changi Village (for transit purposes), then Changi is your best bet to get out of the city life!

Back to the hotel, it's very far from the city and the staff are polite but anything out of the norm is not possible such as a cup of cofee off hours. The TV sets are very old along with the shower stall having mold. The breakfast buffet is the same every day and not that great to begin with.

The room was comfortable, well-appointed and clean, with the exception of the bed sash which was stained; I don't understand why something as small as this is overlooked and not replaced.

The bathroom was spacious and clean but is starting to show mildew on the tile joints around the bath.

There's a lovely rooftop pool, but there are no parasols and there were no shady areas.

Service in the restaurant was very good, however, in the bar it was a different story as I waited 15 minutes for a pot of tea when there were very few guests present and I had to ask for the cake I'd ordered.

Breakfast selection was excellent.

The beach is less than a five minute walk from the hotel and in the area there's a pharmacy, a couple of mini-markets and a big choice of restaurants.

Ok ,the hotel selve proclamations are not really correct, Jo(my boyfriend) normally stays central, but as its Apec and all the presidents and Obama there we went out of centre. Hotels were charging treble so it made sense.

Hard to find and taxi got lost. This is becase side street. From outside ok and staff rushed to help. When walked in very low light and everything smell like disinfectant. Staff were friendly. Sign in simple then up escalator to room. Well i say room it was more cupboard, but hk same so no problem. Boyfriend angry because internet very very bad. Very slow and he booked for this. Bathroom old and water leaking on floor. and bed lumpy. Ac was good.

Hard to sleep as could hear ac from outside wall.
Breakfast was not good and we only ate their once. But staff again nice. We complained and most things fixed next night.
SO staff good but hotel need remaking or star reduxtion
Area was good. Across road little spa- miss Amee, she give good massage and was quite relaxing. I walked round area and Wow. So different from Singapore centre where i was many times. Its like being in India(or how i imagine)
Everywhere indian shops restarants,gold shops, silk shops -the smell of incense the music and all the people-really really cool. And not small area was very many streets.

I had booked an Executive Club Room through Hotels.com-

This room is just 20-25sqmt 'big', with stinking carpetted floor, worn out fully, with stains and holes on the carpet.

I checked the bed thoroughly to find,stained bed sheet & pillow covers full of 'unwanted hair'(on the side which either of us used)!

I came to this hotel after going thru all the reviews on this hotel, but friends, trust me, this hotel sucks.If you are used to bugs and smelly carpets, then you are most welcome to this hotel!

The only assistance we got was ""go to this shopping centre and try there"".  Not very helpful for overseas travellers who only had a very limited time in Singapore.I'm not in any huge hurry to go back to this motel ... or Singapore itself.",2009-07-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Brilliant hotel, near to the airport We stayed here for just one night as we had an early flight out of Changi the following morning and found the hotel to be perfect for what we needed. We booked a superior room but were upgraded to a deluxe room, which was very comfortable, modern and with good facilities. The hotel was also very clean.

The service we received was 1st class. The staff were polite - reception, porters, bar staff etc. The hotel also provides a free shuttle to the airport which takes about 15 mins.

If you do not want to eat at the hotel just take a walk outside where there are plenty of places to eat and drink in the village, here we also found the cheapest beer in Singapore!!

For an overnight stop this place is well worth a visit.",2009-06-01,PreCovid,0
business,,False,,"I'm sorry but a BIG THUMBS DOWN My stay was for one night with a large group of colleagues during May 09. Changi Village (hereafter CV) was our hotel of choice for its secluded location and nice restaurants in the area for a quick getaway. If you live in Singapore and want a getaway without having to board an aeroplane, this would be the ideal place you would pick.

NOPE. BAD MOVE. I am a seasoned traveller and can confidentally say that CV is perhaps the worst hotel of its class. There was not a single area where i found anything to praise the hotel on. I do not give such poor scores so easily on Tripadvisor (see my other reviews) but CV definitly deserves it.

Let's peal it one by one.

Rooms: As basic as it can get... but with molds all over the window. In the room I stayed in, roughly 1/3 of the entire window was covered in mold... I was in disbelief to the point where I was pondering whether this was done deliberately to bring out the 'jungle' feel (no, seriously). The beds are very low and hard - those that you would sleep on admist the battlefields during the world war. The bathroom is perhaps a slight pleasant surprise as it is neat with a nice rainforest shower. But the amenities are minimal and evidently low quality and the squeezing size boasts a claustrophobic feel. The worst part of it all? The smoke smell. The smell was so thick that I ended up smelling like cigarettes after staying in it for a while myself. I would use the word 'disgusting'. Asked for something to be done about this to the front desk and were sent a non-English speaking lad who went around spraying deodorant for about 2 minutes and cruised off.

Overall, functional rooms but with big molds, bad beds and a terrible cigarette smell (despite it being a non-smoking room).

Service: Two thumbs down. Why is the doorman standing around the door if he is not going to open the door for the guests? I arrived in a cab with two big luggages and the doorman was idling around. I would love to see his job-description. I sought to use the business center (at a nosebleed price) but the computer was password protected - for which none of the staff knew the password to... leading us to waste 30 minutes or so until they could get a ""technician"" who came in and typed the password in for us. We asked them to photocopy 100+ sheets (at 50 cents per SIDE) which took them more than 40 minutes - and the end result was handing over of a big load of paper not segregated properly by pages nor stapled. We had to sit in the lobby and separate out the sheets to staple them ourselves - another 15 mins. I could go on and on. Staff were unprofessional, had bad attitude and were slow to requests.

If I may add, do watch out for hordes of prostitutes entering the premises at nighttime. The hotel staff do what they can to hush them away but if they have already engaged a ""client"" i.e. a man sitting in the lobby who decides to entertain them in a conversation, the hotel staff cannot 'kick them out' as they have now earned themselves a 'guest' status. The scene takes on a very sleazy tone at night, so keep your children in the rooms post 11 o'clock... or alternatively, stay somewhere else.

Swimming pool is next to a golf course providing a possibility of a golf ball piercing through your head while you are playing water polo and killing you. There is no MRT in the vicinity (the closest one is actually at the Changi Airport - 20 mins away by cab w/o traffic) so you are stuck where you are unless you venture out on a cab or feel adventurous enough to get on the public bus (approx 1 hour to the central district).

The exterior of the building is crumbling with paint peeling and moss growing all over it. The breakfast buffet is bombarded by dozens of Korean ladies on package tours talking at the top of their lungs and clearing out the food. The hotel souvenir shop is a joke with the shop attendant vacating the shop and not returning for 30 mins onwards. I could go on and on about this hotel but I guess you get it by now.

Stay well away. This goes beyond disappointment and will aid you to experience 'resentment'. For a hotel whose only hope of business is through friendly service and comfortable rooms, they have not got a clue to what needs to be done.

For those of you that had pleasant stays here while it was managed by Le Meridien, mark my words, the experience will probably NOT be the same.",2009-05-01,PreCovid,0
couple,2.0,True,Negative,"Cheap stay but be willing to pay the price We were ending our stay in Singapore and had an early flight to Bangkok, Thailand the next day so my husband and I were looking for a cheap, no frills hotel, that was close to the airport.There is an airport shuttle which is free and very convenient as it runs pretty much every hour.  If you are not planning on renting a car or hiring a private driver, you can take the shuttle from the hotel to the airport and catch the MRT (train system) from the airport.  The hotel pics that are displayed on this site for this hotel are pretty accurate.  I really liked the decor in the hotel and our room was basic.  The BIGGEST issue we had was that the walls are thin.  We had neighbors that were very rowdy and we could hear everything that was going on.  We did contact the front desk and they tried to mitigate the situation twice but it didn't help us.  Another issue we had was that even though we requested a non-smoking room the room smelled like smoke.  We told the front desk about it and they recommended we call housekeeping to have the room refreshed (meaning spray some deordorizer).  That didn't do the trick either.The hotel is located near an outdoor market and down the street are the local shops and the restaurant stalls.  If you want local food, there's a decent variety of eateries to choose from.  The restaurant we ate at was busy but the portions were smaller than other hotels we ate at and the quality/service was not that great.Overall, we were disappointed and would have much rather stayed at the Crowne Plaza hotel which was a few USD dollars more than Changi but would have been much quieter, cleaner, and closer to the airport.

However, the hotel is still a 20 - 30 minute drive from the airport.  To make matters worse, the nearest MRT to get into Singapore is at the airport, so it's not particularly convenient for the airport or for Downtown.

Although it's sometimes described as  being close to the airport, it's in fact a 20 minute drive away. The hotel has its own shuttle bus which can pick you up from and delivery you back to the airport - thus saving money on taxi fares. (Approx hourly - ask at Hotel Reservation counter after passing through immigration/customs). Alternatively, a taxi costs about $S15. The rooms are comfortable and reasonably spacious, although I found the bed a tad hard and the aircon a bit cool. The hotel is in the centre of Changi village with numerous cheap and cheerful restaurants nearby. (I wished I'd foregone breakfast ($S15) at the hotel and tried the nearest one which was serving Dim Sum on a Sunday morning.) There are also some modest local shops, including a chemist, and one selling clothes and fabrics.

We arrived at 21:30 and my wife was a bit peckish so ordered a club sandwich. The sandwich consisted of two quarters not four, and some warmish overcooked chips (fries) for the princely sum of ~S$18++. This spoiled the otherwise pleasant experience.

The surrouding area is quite interesting with some great outdoor fooderies just down the road. The best by far is the furthest one from the hotel on the same side of the road. It's called Changi Teochew Kitchen and the food and service is fantastic. Highlights are chilli crab and cereal prawns.
The hotel is also directly accross from the ferry terminal where you can catch a bumboat accross to Palau Ubin. It only costs $2.50 each way and is a good place to kill a few hours biking around the island spotting butterflies and wild pigs!

There is an hourly shuttle service from the airport, taking about 10 mins (airport staff don't seem to be aware of this and advised us to take a taxi).I would not recommend this hotel if it is all you are going to see of Singapore - there are much smarter hotels in the city which are within easy reach of the airport by MRT train and not necessarily more expensive.  However, if you want somewhere quiet in an area of the city that is frequented by native Singaporeans rather than tourists, this hotel is for you.The pool area is used for weddings so may not be accessible at all times.  We used it early in the morning (before a wedding) so that was OK.  You can see aircraft from the pool area but it is not a really great view, as some reviewers suggest.The nearby Changi Beach has a pleasant walkway and is popular with locals, though not the cleanest beach we have seen.  There are plenty of inexpensive restaurants as well as shops near the hotel, but for a real Singapore experience, go to the hawkers market where fresh fish, sugar cane juice and other delicious dishes are prepared in the little stalls.

Main reason for booking was the close proximity to the airport and what looked like nice rooms. Arriving at 9pm and leaving at 12pm I was looking for somewhere to sleep and relax, and that was all.

I was given a single beds which I was told to just move together to make a double. They were unable to give me anything else.

It took me 5 minutes to walk to the room they had given me, through a maze of dark corridors. It was right in the back corner of the hotel.

The room was a good size. The beds were hard as rocks. The bathroom was not entirely clean. And you could not open the window (I was on the 2nd floor). Why hotels don't have windows is beyond me.

After the walk to the room and a 10 hour flight all's I wanted was a cold beer to relax. Alas there was nothing in the mini bar. After calling reception it turns out that house keeping hadn't stocked that room as no one was supposed to be in it. Some 20 minutes later they finally came and filled it up with warm beer and waters.

My recommendations. Don't stay here. A taxi will take an extra 20 minutes into the city where you can get much better hotels at the same, if not cheeper rates. This place is not worth it. I'm 28 and have stayed in hotels all over the world and feel compelled to advise you not to stay here.

The reception staff were cool - not particularly welcoming and the porter quite off hand. When we arrived in our room there were workers in the room next door banging away. After some while of this we asked if they could stop as we were desperate for a sleep as we were on our way to the UK from Australia and facing a 13 and a half hour flight next day. Despite three requests they did not stop banging. Admittedly they did eventually offer us an alternative room but by then we had unpacked and really did not want to move. There was no chance of rest. We decided to go out for dinner at 7pm they were still banging when we got back at nine.
Despite having an executive room the facilities were poor - one tiny bottle of shampoo, horrible coffee and creamer instead of milk for tea making.

The pool on the eighth floor looked inviting and it was but the spa didn't work.
We made the mistake of going to the bar for a drink - Gin and tonic with flat tonic, no lemon and one ice cube which took ages to arrive.
The breakfast was awful. Despite asking for the apple juice jug to be replenished it never was, the orange juice was from concentrate, there was white bread only for toast, some of the plates and dishes were still dirty.

business,3.0,True,Neutral,"Decent hotel for my needs I arrived at the hotel about 12:30 AM, after traveling for 28 hours form the US. Knowing my way around Singapore, after numerous previous stays, I took a taxi, rather than the hotel shuttle, as I was exhausted and just wanted to get to bed without a hassle. Also factor in that I needed to go into the office the next morning. (I always leave Singapore with enough cash for at least two taxi rides on my next visit.). The taxi was $25 Sing. A little high, but it was after midnight.

The Doorman grabbed my bag immediately and took it inside, placing it near the front desk. I checked in and headed up to my room. Almost to my room, I realized I left my bag downstairs. I go back to the lobby, only to be told that it is already on the way up to my room. Nice attention on their part. I got back upsatirs just as the doorman was ringing the bell.

The bed was rather hard, and the carpet showing some age, but otherwise the room was very nice. The rain shower was terrific, with plenty of hot water. I just wish the controls were within easy reach, so you can avoid that first cold splash. The breakfast was acceptable, with someone there to make eggs any way you want them. The chicken sausages and other items were not as hot as they could be, but acceptable. The mini pancakes were more like potato chips, as crispy as they were. Taxis were always readily available, and I took the free shuttle to the Tampines Mall on Saturday. From there it is easy to take the MRT downtown. The shuttel also took folks to Orchard Road. I used room service one evening, and that was fine. The WiFi worked well, but was expensive. $12.85 for an hour, and $26+ for 24 hours. Fortunately, I could use the internet in the office, and just needed it a little in the hotel. Singapore hotels are about the only ones I encounter anymore that still charge for WiFi. There were a few nice items in the gift shop, and I received a discount for them. There was some airplane noise throughout the night, but not too bothersome. There were two evenings where I returned to find my keycards did not work, but these were quickly fixed. Supposedly a power failure was the cause the first time.

I had an early morning flight home, and did not reserve a taxi ahead of time. I checked out and then went to the doorman station out front. I told them I needed a taxi to the airport, and they summoned one. As others have written, a van showed up. I said I asked for a taxi, not a van. They told me it would cost $28. I gave them a hard look and told them that is all it better cost me. A minute after leaving, the van driver got a brief call. He said OK and hung up. When we got to the airport, he charged me $28. I suspect the doorman called him to alert him that I was wise to the scam.

Breakfast was good although we were in a rush to get back to the Airport.

Would not recommend this as a city central hotel (as per the previous review) - try the Oriental (we stayed here for three days last year).

He shoved us to the back seats. We arrived at the hotel around 2 am. The front desk wasn't too happy to see us.

,,False,,"ok, but... stayed at the Changi Village for a one night stopover in August enroute to Bali with Husband and Daughter.
Found the hotel, room & bathroom all fine - everything clean & functional (bathroom looked fairly new, toiletries fine & shower great - just what was needed after a long flight from UK). Bedroom was a little on the small side but we were, overall, pleasently, surprised (especially after reading some of the previous tripadvisor reviews).
Was a little annoyed that my request for an extra bed (at extra charge) had been overlooked. Reception staff looked almost surprised when I pointed out that we had asked for this - despite it being on my booking confirmation but I was assured that the bed would be set up while we were having our evening meal. Ate from the buffet in the hotel (daughter too tired to venture out!) & have to say it was excellent - good choices, piping hot with dishes constantly refreshed. I note the negative comments re the buffet but we had no complaints (and we are very 'picky' when it comes to food). It was very early, however, so maybe the standards drop later in the evening - I don't know.
So far so good.
The rest, I'm afraid, is a sorry tale - the extra bed for my daughter turned out to be a complete waste of time as it was so uncomfortable that she actually woke in the middle of the night in pain (we took the sheets off and found an old folding bed with a worn mattress which you could feel every spring through - including some rather nasty sharp points).
To cut a long story short we ended up having an almighty row with the young girl at reception the next morning when we asked her to take the cost of the bed from our bill as we were unable to use it. I won't go into details except to say that 'customer service' does not figure here!!!

You might have to wait half an hour for pick-up. The shuttle leaves the hotel to the airport every hour, and is a fast and efficient way of getting there on time.

Changi Village has a quiet, laid back atmosphere. There are plenty of places to eat on the mainstreet, and there's a hawker centre behind the shops near the bus station. Don't feel you have to stick with the hotel restaurant.

business,,False,,"The illusion of being away from it all This hotel is located in Changi Village in SIngapore, at the eastern extremity of the island. Not far from Changi Airport, it is far removed from the bright lights of the city. There is no MRT station nearby, which means those who want to go shopping in the city need to take a taxi or depend on the bus service.

It is the only hotel in Changi village, which is an enclave of Singapore that seems to be wilfully sundered from the rest of the island, not physically but metaphorically. It seems like the shiny development projects that have engulfed most of Singapore have stopped at the threshold of this village.

The hotel is a modern structure and really quite out of place in what
is otherwise - for Singapore - a fairly quaint setting. An earlier incarnation endowed the hotel with coloured balconies, so that is one
of the first things you notice - these pastel coloured glass balconies, as if some artist once passed through here and had a benign hangover when he was decorating the hotel.

There are lovely old trees around the hotel. In fact it exudes an atmosphere of peace and quiet, and the verdant surroundings are somewhat at odds with the structure itself.

I think the hotel had some problems in trying to characterise themselves, but it now comes across as a contemporary business hotel where it may once have favoured itself as a retreat of sorts.

The rooms are done in the sort of pale-wood decor with pretenstions to avant-garde, such as a glass window between the bathroom and the main bedroom, and wicker-lampshades. Overall, the effect is not harmonious. Otherwise the room is quite comfortable if entirely too cold, even with the airconditioning turned off!

The gym on the 5th floor is better equipped than you'd expect, but there are too many signs of inconsistent maintenance around the hotel. One of these are the dead plants that coil around wire frames in the inner courtyard, another is chipped paint on some of the feature walls in the lift lobbies.

In other ways though, the hotel does distinguish itself; the swimming pool has a glass side and chic patterned blue tiles; the main lounge has sunlight filtering into it from glass panels overhead and the view from the glass-panelled elevators of the overall atrium is cosy, if not impressive.

This is a nice hotel to come to to get away from the city, for a retreat of sorts. I think the hotel may have gone through several incarnations, ending up with an odd blend of the mediocre and quite classy, so it's difficult to place it in terms of a star-rating or even of a consistent purpose.

Around it is the delightful, or terribly quotidian, depending on your inclination, village itself, with a wet market, shophouse restaurants selling inexpensive food. Nearby are holiday bungalows of the civil service, which goes some way to explain why Changi Village is what it is, and the beach, and an impressive (for Singapore) wooded area, that you quickly realise is an isolated tract preserved to provide the setting to the holiday chalets where Singapore's presumably frazzled civil servants come to unwind.

The Changi board walk, which hugs the beach, is a welcome, if entirely too short, distraction, but here, at the Changi Village hotel, it is possible, if for a short while, to forget the burgeoning pressures of 21st century city living.",2007-07-01,PreCovid,0

Rooms were clean, staff efficient (but unsmiling!) and the food at the buffet dinner pretty poor.

My body confirmed it was a reheated fish curry at about 3am!!
BUT, dont expect any small luxuries that can turn an ordinary hotel into a good one. Absolutely everything is extra and relatively expensive, such as internet access at $6 for 15 minutes (many hotels now provide this free), coffee at $7 etc. But for me, the piece-de-resistence was the room facilities which were 'minimalist' or non-existent. Absolutely no toiletries apart from 1 bar of soap, nothing in the bar bridge (why have one, I wondered) and, the classic, ONE tea bag! I asked if we could have some more and, after, about half hour, I was bought ONE more!

,,False,,"Very Modern, but yes it is a drive from the airport! I only had about 9 hours between flights in Singapore, and the transit hotel was booked for the night (tried a couple weeks in advance!).  Decided upon the Changi Village hotel because it appeared on the map to be rather close to the airport, and the prices were slightly more reasonable than those in areas like Suntec City, Orchard Road, etc.  There were very conflicting reviews on Trip Advisor regarding the distance from the airport, and so I was anxious to find out how close or far it was!Yes - it is quite a drive from the airport!  When you look at a map, it is close, and in fact you can hear the airplanes taking off!  However, the drive is quite long because it appears that while it is close to the airport, the roads to/from the terminal buildings are long - partly on the highway and partly on surface roads.  From the airport to the hotel it was 15 minutes, about 12 minutes on the way back.  For comparison, a trip from the airport to Suntec City (stayed in that neighborhood a few days prior) was only 15 minutes.  The key benefit of the Changi Village, then, compared to those hotels closer to the CBD and tourist areas, is the free shuttle.  I was lucky in that I arrived at the information counter about 15-20 minutes before the shuttle arrived, however keep in mind that there is only one shuttle an hour.  It leaves from the hotel at the top of the hour, and I guess there really isn't a set time for when the shuttle leaves the airport (my shuttle left ~40 minutes past the hour).The hotel itself is pretty neat - VERY well lit rooms and a very refreshing rain shower after lots of traveling!  It is very modern and chic, and I quite enjoyed the decor.

We explained we were tired, wanted a shower and to sleep, but the receptionist told us we would have to sit in reception until 9am unless we paid the extra! So we had no choice....
The 'Porter' who carried our bags to our room (despite our saying we could carry them ourselves) was so rude, sticking his palm in our faces for a tip!!!! No way after that - Changi Village Hotel add a massive service charge to your bill anyway, so definitely not tipping a rude porter as well.

To top it all, at 12noon, a cleaner banged on our door and let herself in to clean the room! we were in bed trying to sleep!
What a joke.
We would definitely NOT recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a rest after or between flights. The fact that the hotel offers 'day rooms' is misleading, as they certainly do not cater for weary travellers.
Staff were rude and unhelpful.
Overpriced.
Rooms not worth the money.
Only helpful thing was the free shuttle service the hotel operate shourly to and from Changi Airports Terminals 1 and 2 (but not the Budget Terminal - although there is a connection from T2)",2007-05-01,PreCovid,0
couple,,False,,"Don't stay here! After a wonderful ten days in The Maldives and six amazing days in Koh Samui, we stayed in this terrible hotel on our way home.  (We are seasoned travellers and this is the first time i have felt compelled to complain about a hotel).I tried to book this hotel from their website but the website was down and it said to book through the hotel directly.  I called the hotel and told them the site was down and said that i had still wanted to get the internet rate, they said okay.  Well, we get to the hotel...  off to a bad start! There was the longest line to check in and the guy we had to deal with was a rude pig.  Maybe they need to get more staff!  I explain the whole internet deal with the guy at the front desk.  He refuses point blank to accommodate me.  So we end up paying 315 singapore dollars.  Rip off.  He then tells us we will get a free mini bar included in cost.  I then requested a quiet room as we were very tired from travelling all day.  By this time it is 9.30pm.  I also requested a room with a nice view. The guy says 'no problem'. So, we get up to our room, he has put us across from the maid's room! Early the next morning all we here is banging and talking.  Probably the noisiest room he could have given us in the whole hotel.  The 'free mini bar' consisted of two soft drinks, two beers and a chocolate bar.  Wow!  Are they kidding?  We open our curtains to take a look at our 'nice view' and much to my dismay, he has given us a room looking directly at the tops of the trees!  The ocean views were definitely not visable from our room.  This guy was an absolute jerk.  The next morning, having been woken up at the crack of dawn by the maids banging and crashing, we head down to breakfast.  We were not even offered tea and coffee, and when we finally asked for some tea, the water was stone cold.  The 'hot' food on the buffet was also cold.  The miso soup was as cold as a glass of icy water.  Total nightmare. Such a disapointing way to end our amazing holiday.One plus, is that the hotel has been recently renovated and was quite tastefully done.

family,,False,,"Great Family Retreat A friend recommended us the Hotel as a great family retreat venue.  We booked 3 rooms and the hotel took the initiative to assign us a set of connecting room and another room nearby.  The edgeless swimming pool at the roof-top was simply delightful.  One can just relax and dip in the pool and watch planes flying by.  Our little ones were simply amazed by it.  You feel as if the planes are within your reach.There's also a pretty koi pond in the hotel premise.  We felt it a calming area with trees around it to shade the area.Overall the hotel is well maintained, the service staff were helpful and our rooms were clean, of decent size and the room decor is just pleasing - a mix of simple retro and yet modern chic. The hotel served a large selection of buffet breakfast, which we felt was pampering rather than the usual local items in hawker centre.  The seafood BBQ is also a must try.  in local seasoning.  The sambal to go with the squid was 'shiok'. An activity that MUST go with staying at the Changi Village Hotel is - A day-trip to Pulau Ubin.  After we check-in, the family headed to the nearby jetty, took a S$2 bumboat across to Pulau Ubin.  We all rented a bicycle each and cycled around the island. There was much to explore and sightings on durian trees were not uncommon.  Return after all the work-out to chill out at the hotel's pool.

It's reasonably priced and a little closer to the airport than hotels located in the city.
The reception staff were friendly and efficient and we were able to check in and arrange a wake up call without any delays.
We arrived late at night however there seemed to be plenty of activity in near by restaurants and food stalls.
The room was modern in design although a little on the small side. This was not a problem as we checked in late and departed very early in the morning.
I was pleasantly surprised by the modern bathroom which was clean and well stocked with toiletries and plenty of towels.
The only unusual thing was the glass window between the bathroom and the bedroom ! I am not sure what purpose it served however you have the option to pull down a blind if you want to prevent anyone in the bedroom watching you using the bathroom or shower !
Overall our short stay at this hotel was a pleasant experience.
Check in and check out was handled smoothly (which is important if you have a flight to catch) and it was easy to obtain a taxi back to the airport.
Don't stay here if you are staying in Singapore for more than a night, this hotel is in a residential area and there are many more reasonably priced hotels in the city (which is really where you would want to be if you are a tourist).

Also very convenient for getting to the airport for early morning departures. Only thing to watch is your kids flicking through the videos that are available.

couple,,False,,"Great Stopover Hotel My husband and I stayed here for one night as a stopover after returning from Thailand and heading back to the U.K. as previous reviewers said it was near the airport. Whilst it is slightly nearer the airport than the city centre, an extra 10 minutes in a taxi would take you into the heart of the city. Changi Village doesn't have much going for it and in some ways resembles a 70's housing scheme rather than a village. However, try Charlies Corner for a huge selection of international beers and Jacobs Cafe for decent food, both just a stroll from the hotel.

The hotel itself was great with incredibly friendly staff and pleasant rooms. The public areas were very impressive and stylish for an out of town hotel. There are two very nice pools, one on the roof which is great to watch the planes coming into the airport. We had this pool to ourselves for most of the afternoon.

Breakfast was fine and the free shuttle to the airport was an added bonus.

Our only criticism was that we booked an upgraded room on the internet but on return, having looked at their website again, I think we just got a standard room. Since we were only there one night we didn't bother complaining.

For an airport stopover this hotel was very nice and the staff were more friendly than in the Oriental Singapore (which is 5*) where we stayed earlier in our Far East tour.",2007-05-01,PreCovid,0

You can even ride the bus to the airport and catch the subway to the city in less than 20 minutes although I'd say it isn't too good an idea to be staying at this hotel if you're in Singapore for any more than 2 days.

The lobby is very contemporary by design. The lifts and its foyers were very interesting but the corridors to the rooms do look slightly tired, and the walls haven't been painted well enough. Rooms were bright and clean, quiet enough, and the rainfall shower was refreshing. However, you do get a feel that whilst the design looks new and modern, the hotel has probably spent very little on the renovation hence the 'cheap' feeling. Toiletries were too limited, and there should have been more towels of different sizes provided at a 4 stars hotel!",2007-04-01,PreCovid,0
,,False,,"a little gem This hotel is greatly improved over its Le Meridien days when it was a bit sad looking. Seems to have found a niche as boutique like hotel, although it has close to 400 rooms, and as business hotel serving the logitsics parks nearby.
Looking for a bit of luxury we booked a junior suite, not exactly a suite per se but a large L shaped room. By far the best feature was the huge bathroom. A truly massive bathtub, easily can fit two(!), seperate rainforest shower, double sinks etc.
The hotel has an lovely rooftop pool - where relaxing and staring at the sea can be combined with plane watching (better than it sounds).
Gym is not bad - serves its purpose well enough for a short stay.
There is a superb value Japanese restaurant on the ground floor. Otherwise plenty of cheap eats to be had in Changi Village itself. If you're coming to S'pore for Orchard Rd this is not the place to stay, but if you fancy as about of the beaten track as you can get in the city state this is it.

as much time to get to the airport as it does from the Marina area. The upside is that the price here for an overnight is quite decent. The lobby is a modern bright and upbeat place. The room decor is decidedly European. If you had stayed in any recent Novotel, you will
find yourself right at home. The bed is almost right out of the IKEA catalog and quite soft for my back. The room is bright and airy and so is the bathroom. One thing about the bathtub and you try to take a shower standing up. More chance than not, you will spill water out on the floor as there is no curtain.

For a quick night and cheap accommodation, it got my vote. However, the area is not a good place to go out at night unless you are looking for some local food.",2006-06-01,PreCovid,0

,,False,,"The staff made this trip and hotel stay great! I stayed at Changi Village on business for nine days in Feb. 07. I was dropped off by my client just after midnight after over 21 hrs in flights in 24 hours. So, coming through the front doors of the hotel it was wonderful to be greeted by such friendly front desk staff.

The room was very neat, clean and up to-date. I very much enjoyed being able to control the A/C with three fan speeds and a very large temperature range from warm through cool to near freezer temps. The complimentary bottled water in the room was a nice touch. In 35C heat bottled water for day trips is a must to take with you.

The out door pool on the roof top has to have one of the most stunning of any hotel I've stayed at. The outdoor pool on the ground floor with a glass side is a great to swim in and visually stunning later in the evening while enjoying the out door dining and BBQ. Plus the quite garden on the sixth floor with the pond, fish and trees is great place to start your day during sunrise.

Then there is the staff! Yasmin on the front desk is so professional and upbeat to deal with, Gerald in food and beverage and his team provide a wide selection of food types at ever meal for the buffet. The hostess (with the mostest~ as I teased her) is first rate with her uplifting hello every day and after only twice knew my name! If I could only extend the same back to her.

The gentlemen on the front door helped me effortlessly unload and reload my clients printing supplies (more than once) with nothing but sincere smiles and upbeat attitudes.

Others on this site have talked about how far away it is from the airport. They offer a free shuttle service to and from the airport on the hour. Not fast enough? For less than $15.00 S$ $ you can take a cab to the hotel. Then there is the it's a long way to downtown. Well every major US city and most major Canadian cities I've stayed at are not only $16.50 to the downtown Singapore city core for this quality of stay. Plus your only minutes from the beach, the famous Changi Prison museum, several outdoor restaurants, a cotton and silk clothing merchant just down the road where for less than $ 200.00 S dollars I brought home several great gifts pieces for my spouse, mother and nieces.

In all the Changi Village in Singapore offered a very fair price, excellent food and beverage service and product, and I had a great staff experience in all sectors of the hotel.

Even to the point that on our return to the hotel three weeks after the first visit one of the staff at the door said """"welcome back""!!

The hotel is in a pleasant and very quiet location and we appreciated the courtesy bus to and fro the airport plus the courtesy bus to Orchard Road for shopping. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. All in all a very happy stay and we shall certainly return.",2007-02-01,PreCovid,0
,,False,,"Please Avoid if you want to be close to town -- extremely inconvenient location We spent one night at this Hotel in early January, 2007. Hotels.com website misleads you in believing this hotel is close to Orchard Rochard but in actuality they are miles away in a very inconvenient location.
They apparently have another property (associated with the Le Meridien?) which is close to Orchard Road but that is not this hotel.

You may feel this hotel is a good deal but the inconvenience of getting to and fro is NOT at all worth it. You can pay S$ 20-40 more and get a lovely hotel on Orchard Road itself.

If your plan is to just spend some time in a hotel I would recommend this hotel. If your plans are to visit town and get around Singapore I would not stay at this hotel at all. You can get around easier by taxi but the cost will offset any savings on hotel price. It takes 40-60 minutes each way (no joke) to get to Orchard Road or anywhere around town by MRT and or bus.

The hotel otherwise is very nice and the staff are extremely helpful. The rooftop pool is lovely with a gorgeous panaromic view. The overall hotel, the rooms and bathrooms are very new and would appeal to anybody. But their way-off location negates these other positives.
If you are used to eating at small but yummy ""hawker-style"" restaurants in South East Asia, there is a strip of restaurants right next door. We love most Asian food and loved the food here. It is truly open 24 hours.

The hotel is located in a residential area and as with most places in S'pore it appeared safe.

,,False,,"Didn't Care for It My husband and I stayed here for one night in January since we had an early morning flight from Singapore.  I don't know if it was because of the change in management, but we have never had so many problems with a hotel.  The only good thing is we were upgraded to a better room than we paid for and had a nice view of the water.  But the key cards are incredibly sensitive, and at different times we had to pull the key card out really fast and another time had to pull it out really slow for it to work.  We saw lots of other travelers struggling to get into their rooms.  Also, the rooms are very high tech but as a result it was frustrating to try to figure out how things worked when we were in a daze from traveling.  For instance, the shower was unlike any shower we have ever seen, and an errant twist of the faucet left my husband simultaneously scalded and freezing (from different showerheads), and if you hit the wrong light switch in the middle of the night, a whole chorus of clicking sounds and lights goes off which is quite disconcerting to the person remaining in bed!  Also, trying to get a drink at the bar proved to be an exercise in frustration because there were two brand-new, albeit well meaning bartenders who were overwhelmed even though there were hardly any customers.  I am willing to admit that we could have just caught the hotel on a bad day, and it is a nice looking hotel in an interesting neighborhood, but we won't stay here again.",2007-01-01,PreCovid,0

The Saltwater cafe serves a good buffet breakfast and the buffet lunch is really quite excellent. It has a huge selection of HOT and cold meals. The quality of the food served is quite superior.
We found an interesting 'board walk' along the beach and the village has a big food market, interesting shops and good little eateries.
The shuttle service to the airport is an added bonus and we happened to be the only people to require it on our departure day, they still took us with no moans or groans!

Once a day there is a free shuttle bus however.
The hotel is not cheap for the individual traveller. There can be busloads of group travellers at heavily discounted prices.

The restaurants are simple although there are a few standard dishes that they can prepare well. They cannot compete with regular restaurants in town. The buffets could be a lot better and the breakfast buffet is just below average.

I booked this hotel at the last minute (about 3hrs before we flew out) so didn't have time to do much research on it. For being peak season (28th Dec) - it was very reasonably priced so my friends and I were a bit dubious about how good the hotel was going to be.

Happily, we found the hotel to very good. The rooms are new-ish, clean and have quite comfortable beds. I'm not sure about the area it is in as we arrived and left during darkness.

I would strongly suggest this hotel as an alternative to the Amari at the airport, which is exceedingly expensive and hasn't seem to have been awarded many positive reviews.

A taxi costs about $25 Singapore dollars to get the hotel from the airport but I would suggest using the shuttle.

Only one piece of advice, make sure that you book a non-smoking room. The windows don't open, so the smoking rooms stink of stale smoke. The staff very happily moved us to another room, so it wasn't too much of a problem.",2006-12-01,PreCovid,0

The people are lovely and there are loads of cafes/restaurants to chose from.  Mostly aimed at the local population which makes them very, very cheap.  We tried a few but liked Jacobs Cafe best.  If you are interested in the RAF camp then its still there!  Changi museum is not far away and definitely worth a visit.  This hotel is near to the beach (which is not something you expect in Singapore) and there is a great boardwalk along the coast just 5 minutes away.  The roof top swimming pool was brilliant.

family,,False,,"Moan about this hotel...no way My wife, 15 month old son and I stayed at Le Meridian Changi a total of two nights for our out/return legs of our holiday.

Before booking I read mixed reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and would recommend anyone staying here for a stop over.

The hotel is about 15 mins from Changi Airport by taxi costing between 10-15 SGD depending on time of day. Alternatively you can take the dedicated hotel shuttle bus both ways but we only used it hotel-airport. The bus departs from the hotel (without delay) hourly and is easy and free, dropping at two terminals.

We didn't have time to explore much of the village but we did eat out at a few different places; the food market by the bus station is 5 mins walk where you can eat various tasty cuisines in a lively atmosphere, most dishes costing less than 6 SGD! For a few dollars more you can eat just around the corner at an outdoor seafood restaurant which is busy with locals which is always good sign. We did order room service on one occasion and this was good quality and delivered in 15 mins promised.

The hotel lobby is stylish and modern. Staff have been criticised on this site but I found their service understated, efficient and courteous at all times; they delivered a baby cot to our room quickly and even washed our sons bottle without question. Unlike others I'm not impressed by stick-on smiles and over the top bowing and scraping.

Our Deluxe room booked direct with the hotel cost 184.00 SGD/night. The room was spacious, clean and modern with views over lush tree tops. The bathroom was also excellent with, as the hotel describes, a 'cheeky' window in the shower wall so you can see into the bedroom. This gives a open, unrestricted feeling to the whole bedroom.

,,False,,"OK for a [very] short visit Stayed in the Changi Village Hotel for one night en-route to Brunei. (on 10th April) Comfortable room but spoiled by carpet stains. Wierd bathroom arrangement - a window between the bath/shower section and the bedroom - so if you have friends in and want to take a shower they get a ringside seat of you scrubbing away at the naughty bits!! Plus the hot water takes an age to flow.

The general area is not particularly exciting and that's why I would only recommend this as a stopover for one night, anything more I would recommend going into the city. I had to extend by one night due to Emirates losing my case in Dubai and the hotel were ok in continuing my booking but as I had booked via Star Asia they didn't allow my preferential rate to be applied until after I spoke with the duty manager. This was satisfactorily resolved but what really irritated me was when I checked out on 12th April the clerk tried to add on the service charge and taxes - however I had a confirmed booking via Star Asia stating the cost included all taxes and service charges.
After an argument the clerk re-checked the booking voucher which confirmed my assertion. After all that he still got the final account wrong; so my message is for everyone to check the final bill carefully. The hotel was generally quiet and I did get a good night's sleep.

For those who have a laptop, the room safe is big enough to take it and a lot more too. An important consideration as the security is not the best. The room cleaner was cleaning my room when I returned and I just wandered in without being challenged.

I didn't have any meals in the hotel as there are many good quality restaurants/cafes very close by (and I'd recommend Jacob's Cafe for value and quality). The shuttle service that operates between the airport and the hotel is hourly and you need to go into the Singapore Visitor Centre in Terminal 1 to book it. It takes about 25 minutes to get from Terminal 1 then via terminal 2 to the hotel. Overall I'd say this hotel is average - nothing exciting, but ok for an overnight.

Everything about it was above average. Very friendly staff, good breakfast buffet, swift elevator service and unusual rooms. The only improvement I would suggest is the placement of a sofa or lounge chair in each room for relaxing and reading.

The village itself I found to be more interesting than downtown Singapore. Within easy walking distance of the hotel is a nice beach, ferry service to a nearby island, a wonderful ""hawker center"" with a wide variety of foods and beverages, alfresco dining cafes and assorted shops.

For those who need the city experience, the hotel offers hourly (24 hours a day) free shuttle to Changi Airport where you can catch the MRT subway into town.",2006-03-01,PreCovid,0
business,,False,,"Nice hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights as we were attending an expo. We were upgraded to a larger room that had a very nice view over the trees to the water beyond. The pool area is excellent and a calm area to relax after a day of business. We visited the local hawker market and had meals there most nights. The food was local, fresh and cheap. We purchased our drinks at the local liquor shop so did not have the expense of using the mini bar. The nearby shopping area also had other places to dine and shops including a beauty therapist where I had a nice facial.

This hotel is a long way out from the main shopping area. The MIT train takes 25 to 30 mins to get into the city and you have to take a 10 minute taxi ride to get to the nearest station from the hotel.However, if you are in Singapore for and Expo or need a break while travelling from Europe to Asia this hotel is perfect. I would stay here again if I was breaking a journey from say London to Australia.",2006-03-01,PreCovid,0
,,False,,"Nice place for stopover This hotel is quite nice for a stopover as its close to the airport, but i believe the other hotels around Orchard rd are not too much further anyway.

There is a free shuttle to/from Changi airport but it was full both times i tried to use it so ended up taking a cab.

The rooms are a reasonable size, with modern decor and they are very clean. However my room had a strange musty smell kind of like damp. I couldnt pin point what exactly it was, but it was a little off putting.

Breakfast has a fairly wide selection and the quality is quite good.

The local area hasnt got much in the line of things to do, so hop in a cab (very cheap) to Orchard and spend some time there.",2005-12-01,PreCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"10 days of pleasure We initially made the decision to book the Changi Village Hotel after reading other reviews. Our first visit to Singapore (2 adults and a 13 year old daughter) needed to be as perfect as you could plan for because, let's face it, it is an expensive vacation from the shores of the U.K. It suddenly got more expensive when we tried to board our plane, just to find out that one of our passports was ""not in order"". Thank goodness that our air travel was with Emirates! Fast track system with the Passport office was eased by their timely intervention and within 48 hours, not only had they smoothed the way for our control documents but we paid no excesses and got no less than 1st class service upon our second arrival. With one quick stop in Dubai, the 16 hour journey took its toll and we were extremely pleased to note the complimentary air conditioned coach of the hotel was awaiting our arrival and moreso, only a ten minute ride from our selected complex. This coach does in fact, attend both terminals of Changi Airport, every hour of the day and as such, became a great way of getting back to our hotel after a hard days shopping and sightseeing, via the other interim modes of transport available to us. The MRT (mass rail transport system), the very frequent bus services and the constant stream of taxis available.
Anyway, something else we learned of earlier in our quest to get this vacation off to a good start is booking rooms at hotels in Singapore. My logic says that a ""de-luxe"" room is below the standard of a ""superior"" room, right?? WRONG! For whatever reason this was first determined, do not get led into the falsehood of the description. You will pick up on this when you check out the room rates anyway but if you are booking a ""package deal"" with an agent, you might not have at first, sussed this out. Our ""de-luxe"" room standard gave us an external view, more facilities and if you can manage to get to the top floor of the 7 storey (the 8th floor is the roof top swimming pool and health suite) accomodation, then you will indeed, reap the benefits of the outstanding views they have to offer.
We were initially concerned with the possibility of aircraft noise but previous reviews stated that there was not much of it. Sorry guys but you were either so shattered after the long journey's inwards that you slept through all of it or,, as we found out on our extended stay (most visitors to this hotel use it as a short stay accomodation before flying off again to mainland Malaysia or Hong Kong etc.), they DO tend to utilise alternative runways that means the aircraft departing the airport, occasionally do so, in the direction of the hotel. Trust me, Changi airport is VERY busy throughout the day AND the night, so thank goodness again for the good quality of the double glazed balcony doors they use in the rooms. This is a very modern hotel and has a good ratio of staff to visitors. The little extras such as the complimentary bath robes, slippers, daily ""Straits Times"" newspaper, multi channel plasma TV, fridge and quality safe, all add to the charm of the establishment.
We did in fact, NOT eat in the hotel. When on your doorstep, there are about 20 main road restuarants, serving every type of food you can think of and to top this, a hawkers food centre just across the road, again with about 30 different establishments therein with the average plate of refinery costing less than $2 singapore ($US 1 or 60 pence in UK money), you may quickly see why. $20 singaporian money and you can have a seafood banquet for 3 people, including the drinks!
Access to surrounding islands is also a benefit to staying at this hotel. The adjacent harbour caters for all sorts of excursions from just $2 singapore. That just leaves the shopping (shame the electronic items such as cameras and laptops were not exactly as cheap as you would first assume but clothing, you will bag a lot of bargains) and sightseeing to be done. Again, the hotel scores another few points in being able to provide a daily complimentary air conditioned coach to the downtown areas. It drops you off at a place called Orchard, from where, any part of the island is accessible to you. You make your own way back at your own leisure but this is where their Airport coach comes in handy. Use the MRT to get to the airport and make the short walk through terminal 2 and approach the hotel reservations desk to your right, just before the McDonalds snack bar, and just ask them for transport to Changi Village. It picks up outside at about 20 minutes before the hour. This WILL save you quite a bit of money against alternatives fares, as cheap as they are, it all adds up. Just two tips to end on.. If you are a smoker (like me), don't bother buying any duty free tobacco products on the way in. There IS no duty free allowance for them and they will ""deposit"" them for you, until you leave Singapore, for a fee. No point in attempting to pay duty on them as you can buy cheaper within Singapore. Expensive as they then are, be careful how you use them. Bus stops and air con restaurants etc. are a no no area and the fines are REALLY heavy.. not as heavy as posessing drugs mind you. Certain amount of heroine for instance and you'll become a permanent resident of Singapore, albeit, about 6 feet underground. No exceptions. We experienced the demise of an Australian whilst we were there so this is no wind up. Apparently, Singapore is a gateway to the west for drugs, so we took an extra few minutes to completely re-check the packing of our cases before we left the hotel and put plastic anti tamper tie seals on the catches straight afterwards. Like I said, they take NO excuses and I would not liked to have been the unsuspecting trafficker. Overall, Singapore is a very CLEAN ( do not drop litter,, there's a heavy fine for that too), pleasant, hottish (95F with a similar humidity index), friendly and scenic island that I can thoroughly reccommend, whether it be for 5 or ten days. The hotel, equally reccommended as being good value for money, strategically positioned with easy access to all you could ever want on your vacation.",,,0
,,False,,"Nice Airport-Hotel, but not wow We stayed there middle of Sept. 2005 for 1 night before we've been flying to Bali. It's about 15 min. by taxi  (about SGD 17.--) from the airport. It's indeed more a hotel for stays next to the airport when you have an early morning flight the next day and don't want to go to the city (Orchard Rd. / Scotts Rd.) in the evening. If you want to stay in the heart of the city I really recommend the Grand Hyatt Scotts Road (see my other review from today for Grand Hyatt Singapore). The rooms are nice, but a little bit special with the ""light green"" colour.",2005-09-01,PreCovid,0
business,,False,,"Not Bad I stayed here because it was close to the office and the airport.  It was my first time in Singapore and the hotel seemed a bit too far away from the excitement of a  big city, but I was still pleasantly surprised.  The lobby and rooms were stylish and the staff was friendly.   Perfect for an overnight business trip.  Would not stay here longer than one night though.  The beds were rock hard.",2005-09-01,PreCovid,0
,,False,,"i'm really impressed the rooftop pool has a nice view of the Changi beach.. i really enjoyed my stay there in the delux room as i've paid below S$140 for double occupancy (one weekend night only). the hotel and room interior designs is very Zen, the bathroom has a clear glass wall which i found interesting and nice..great for couples actually. the only bit which i thought it was silly was the difference between the superior and delux rooms..the superior rooms are on the lower levels with no bedroom slippers whereas the delux rooms are on the higher levels and they come with bedroom slippers..besides that everything is the same including the roomsize.",2005-03-01,PreCovid,0
,5.0,True,Positive,"The Meridien is just the ticket! If you are planning a trip which involves a brief stop over in Singapore , you could do no better than stay at the Meridien Hotel in Changi Village.This recently refurbished , 4 star hotel ,offers comfort and style at affordable prices.It has restaurants and bars on site, a fantastic roof top pool and spa treatment centre.
The rooms are designer chic with all mod cons.
If you are feeling adventurous you could venture out for a stroll, stop and sup, and watch the colourful local traders and tourists walk by - or you could just stay in the hotel !
For the golfers amongst you there is a golf course on site, where you can work up a sweat during your stay.
Me ? - I pampered my tastebuds in the restaurants, lounged in the bar at night and savoured the pool and deck area during the day.
What bliss!",,,0
business,,False,,"My Cuppa! Excellent hotel; though it's located on the outskirts of Singapore, but can be resolved by flagging the ever-abundant cabs down. Situated extremely close to Changi Airport, the hotel has a beach frontage. Both the facade and interior are simply chic, snazzy, and contemporary! Features 4 F&B establishments: Saltwater, Ryan's Washoku, Vau Wine Bar, and La Cantina in Venizia-- where La Cantina the Italian Restaurant on the rooftop should be given special mention for its scrumptious and truly authentic Italian food, and friendly service(though it's definitely not a fine-dining restaurant which tabloids claim to be otherwise). The hotel-managed Saltwater restaurant serves excellent breakfast and can match that of a 5-star hotel. The restaurant itself at Saltwater is attractive, and almost resembles that of the Le Meridien Kuala Lumpur. Rooms may be small but they are definitely appealing to me. One great feature of the rooms is the stunning bathroom that opens up at your discretion to have a view of your room and beyond! Service-wise, the hotel really needs to keep up with its image as it is not consistent with the various departments--F&B, Housekeeping, Front Office, with Front Office being the one in dire need of improvement: Why be so stuck up? Special mention should be given to Lyna of housekeeping with her vibrant yet warm hospitality rendered during my stay there. Also, the gym is awesome and so is the pool. Executive lounge's a nice, quiet place to hang out in as there is not a single soul(not even the hotel staff) to bother you whilst there. Highly recommended, though uprooting this hotel(*snickers*) and placing it in the heart of Orchard road--which I know will never happen--will be an added plus!",2004-12-01,PreCovid,0
