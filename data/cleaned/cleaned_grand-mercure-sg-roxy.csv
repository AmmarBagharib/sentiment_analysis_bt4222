couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Australian Travellers As a  member of Accor we chose this hotel for our one day stay in Singapore approximately 2 years ago. The hotel is a short taxi ride from the airport with many small eateries, shops and fruit vendors across the road. The pool area is a relaxing environment. Room was very comfortable with a comfortable bed, clean with good linen and nicely appointed bathroom with amenities. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and were promptly seated. When our meal arrived it was brought by a Robot and served by staff. Different and nice! Meal was very good too!

family,2.0,True,Negative,"A once great hotel but no more I’ve stayed at the Roxy since 2012, mainly for work but any family trips going through Singapore and I’ve always booked here.  Over the course of 200 + nights the one major thing the Roxy can offer guests is the staff and location. The staff have always been excellent and remain so, the location (whilst a little out of the way) has everything you need. From 328 Katong Laksa to Sin Hoi Sai Eating house and multiple hawker stalls and malls within a 5 minute walk, you don’t need to go far.  Unfortunately though that’s where it stops now! The Roxy was a dated hotel when I first arrived 11 years ago, since then the rooms have had little to no attention spent on them. Because of this the rooms are not great and if you’re going an Executive room just save your money. The rest of the",2023-09-01,PostCovid,0
business,2.0,True,Negative,Felt like a budget hotel Post covid this was my first stay at Roxy. Prior to this I have been visiting since 2005. No water bottles at the hotel instead we are required to use the dispenser outside the room. The usual breakfast area was shut. So it was shifted to 4th floor and was very crowded and options were very limited. My room 406. Getting out of shower is dangerous as one might slip and fall due to extension of sliding door. Amenities have reduced. Common Body wash dispensers were provided. The body wash had exhausted and had informed the front desk but no one replenished it. AC was set to 22 deg it was very cold. The AC buttons weren’t functioning properly so had to switch it off but after a while it was very hot. Had complained at the front desk and next day it was set for 23 to 24 deg but it,2023-08-01,PostCovid,0
solo,2.0,True,Negative,"Very expensive and rubbish service I stayed here for one night. The cost, even though I booked 5 months in advance was extremely expensive, 206 SGD. I remember when I booked thinking it was expensive but I thought why not for a bit of luxury!  First issue is the airport shuttle has stopped, price of taxi  25 dollars there and 16 back! For that you might as well stay at the Crowne Plaza and walk to the airport!   I arrived at midnight and checked in. I was upgraded to the 17th floor, which is the Executive Floor. All good I thought. I was then given my free drink voucher. I asked where the bar was and it was closed! Nowhere at all to spend my free drink voucher.

We had an additional bed for my son and there was plenty of room. Nice swimming pool. We didn't eat in the hotel. There is a shopping mall, restaurants and Hawkers market opposite the hotel  so great to pop over for cheap food. Taxis are reasonably priced and all metered you don't need to tip anywhere in Singapore. We used taxi to visit the Gardens at the Bay (amazing)and Singapore zoo night safari. We went to the Jumbo Seafood restaurant one night this was very disappointing and very expensive. Bought tickets on the hop on bus (as the Ducktour was sold out).

The check-in process took some time as the other staff were also busy preparing for the airline crews' check-in. I wished that the other team could have been more sensitive as we were traveling with kids below 10 yrs old and it was their bedtime already.  I need to put this comment as we arrived 10 mins before the airline crews arrived, yet we had to wait in line behind another guest just because the other team at the receptionists were busy preparing for the airline crew's arrival.  the receptionist who received us was kind enough and offered us an extra bed in our room, free of charge. to our surprise, the extra bed",2023-07-01,PostCovid,0

Nicely located in a more residential type area than the city it was a simple 15 minute taxi ride from the airport.  A good size mall with multiple eating options was 5 minutes away, as was a good size street food hall with lots of excellent food. It was a gentle 15 minute stroll down to the very pleasant waterfront area.   Checking in and out was efficient and all of the staff were friendly. I'd read that the hotel was showing its age but we found it to be pretty fresh and spotlessly clean.  Our room was a good size, as was the bathroom, with plenty of bench space and comfy seating.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet.    all in all a very pleasant stay and we will definitely be back. ",2023-05-01,PostCovid,0

The hotel is located with a 15 mins ride from Changi Airport and from here, there are several bus routes going to the city centre, which takes around 30-40 mins.   Honestly speaking, I just expect this would be a normal hotel without great services. However, I proved I am wrong.  All services come from 1st impression. Upon arrival, I have been warmly welcomed by the Concierge staff who has guided me to the check-in counter. There are not much people waiting for check in as I arrived in late afternoon and I just waited for around 3 minutes to be served.

George cleaned the room thoroughly and enthusiastically. He was always smiling and was very helpful.  He even gave us a bouquet of paper flowers that was originally made for him from the housekeeping department as a Father’s Day appreciation gift since he is expecting his first child next month.  10/10 to George. Never have I felt so at home in a foreign country where I can come back to a clean hotel room.   The hotel itself is actually kind of old, but really well maintained; except for the lifts that were closed down for maintenance.

So if you like long waits for your lift, which sometimes is jam packed or you have to wait another again this is the place for you. Not only that some of the buttons are missing or do not work and the numbers telling you what floor you are on are all over the place - 2 floor 6's - one of which is floor 4!!  For short stayers, breakfast is ok, but if you are planning a longer stay, for business it doesn't really cut it.

Impeccable and gracious service The hotel, in the heart of historic Katong has beautiful touches of the Peranakan culture showcased giving it a unique elegant vibe.  On our several visits, we have had the privilege of enjoying their range of room types (the different configurations of suites are especially generous in space and storage) and the sea view from upper floors is breathtaking despite the surrounding tall buildings. The view facing inland gives an enchanting view of urban landscape.

Thanks to Maria and the team.  I should mention that every staff member we spoke to was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and quiet, with the basics we we required.   There are major works going on outside for a new MRT station and apart from the crazy traffic, it didn’t seem to impact  the hotel.   We arrived just before midnight and the only room service option was from an off-site provider, with fusion-ish menu and you needed to pay cash.

,4.0,True,Positive,Transit in Singapore  Upgraded to a suite which was lovely.   The room was clean and the beds very comfortable.   The pillows were quite hard and as we were only stopping one night I didn’t call reception.   The breakfast was uninspiring.  I had an omelette but the rest was very ordinary.

This time we were upgraded to a junior suite which just added to our stay.  We only had 1 night as this was just a stopover on the way to another destination but the hotel always treats us well and the staff are professional, friendly and helpful.  The junior suite was well appointed and comfortable with plenty of room and great amenities.  The pool and bar were well kept and again the staff were helpful and friendly. This is a great hotel for an overnight stay for in transit passengers as it is only 15 minutes from the airport compared to hotels right at the airport which are quite expensive in comparison.

Located in the suburban area of East Coast park, just a short 10-15 minute taxi from Changi, this hotel is a great base camp for Singapore.

We were surprised that the hotel management was able to maintain the good staff over the last 3 years while most hotels were unable to do so.  When we  checked in the staff recognised us and were happy to see us back. This made us feel we are coming home. Most of the staff are new except for Venus, Eves and Iskandar.

Clean and well lit - no signs of mould (the missus is very mould phobic). It doesn't have a Nespresso machine nor would I expect though for the room rate. I did get to use the pool and it looked better in actuality than when I looked at it from my room in my last visit. It's cold in the afternoons but better in morning with sun not blocked. The underground carpark or adjacent multistorey car park was easy to park. No complimentary car park though. The executive lounge is open at L17 - great views but only help yourself  drinks and coffee (11-7pm).

No airport shuttle anymore but by the end of '23, the MRT is supposed to be finished and the station is right in front of the hotel so will be very easy transport from Changi.  The friendly doorman helped get a taxi to the airport.  Taxi from the airport a 2 a.m. was $25 and $15 back during the day.

The actual club lounge can only be used for self service coffee and soft drink during the day.  Evening drinks and canapes are served in a corner of the main restaurant. Does not feel special. I know hotels are trying to catch up after 2 years of no clients but don't scrimp on your best customers. They also tried on the 2 drinks only but after several complaints to management they reversed this decision. Also complained that the limited snacks were cold and we actually got the warmers lit.  Still canapes are very basic and mostly fried. There is some cheese and biscuits which is ok. Room was fine and bed comfortable. Need to ditch the mini toiletries. ,2022-10-01,PostCovid,0

In Fact, the staffs, just like from the other reviews of other guests will not hesitate to brush you off, argue with you and to make sure they prove you wrong.

family,1.0,True,Negative,"Never again My first 1 star review... also the last time I would ever stay here.
After an 8 hour delayed midnight flight from Melbourne to Singapore, we were looking forward to our private transfer arranged by the Hotel. Alas, the young gentlemen had our name wrong. That's fine... but the look he had on his face as we approached was of confusion. Before he even greeted us we was on the phone. I asked if everything was OK, to which he replied... not really, your family won't fit in the car he had. Rather than have a pointless debate about why didn't he get a larger car, at 6am and severely delayed flight all we wanted to do was get to the hotel, we I told him to take my wife and our baby, I would take our toddler with me the hotel via taxi.
As we checked in, we explained our situation and how the transfer didn't work out as booked and planned... the duty manager William Kong, rather than apologised shoved the invoice for the transfer in my face and said ""we organised this for you, you should at least say thank you""... flabbergasted, I said the service booked wasn't the service received, in light of me having to catch a taxi & having to be separated from my wife and our baby. William continued to justify their stance by stating I hadn't informed them of how much luggage I'd be bringing, despite never being asked to do so when booking with them. Simple maths for William, I booked a room for my wife and kids, he or his team should have organised a vehicle suitable for that size. He also stated it was a third party provider, not the hotels own vehicle. Further subsequent investigations revealed the hotel booked for only one passenger and NOT for a family... still no apologies, hence the need for me to write this scathing and disappointing review.
The room itself was apparently an ""upgrade"" - not sure how when it was the furthest room from the lifts, can be draining when you have two kids and also right next to a fire exit so you'd occasionally hear the door opening, perhaps by staff. The air-conditioning was very loud and thought it would die whilst there. Breakfast was average. Location, not great... nothing there for kids, our fault as we should have done better research.

All in all, never again. I would never stay at this place and would avoid it at all costs. No value, appaling service and location not ideal as there are lots of construction around.",2022-06-01,PostCovid,0

Requested for one bed rather than two combined bed as one but end up with two beds combined without even being told.   Asked for a quiet room as I am a light sleeper but end up the lady staff I guess tried her best to allocate me to second room next to the lift facing the pool. It’s nice to face the pool but the kids playing and screaming at the pool all day just feels like I’m at the pool literally with the kids. Maybe it’s because she gave me a room at level 6 so it’s almost like on the same level as the pool hence the noise level coming from the pool is high as well.   Thank goodness I brought my ear plugs along else I don’t think I can sleep much. Didn’t really have a good rest at all.   The room carpet was damp,2022-02-01,Covid,1

Not just from noise outside the hotel but internally from rooms above or below. the hotel is ideally placed . A food court is nearby  , as is a shopping mall.  The bus stop in front of the hotels has something like about 25 different buses which go to various parts of Singapore .  And for those arriving after 2024 there will be an underground station right outside the hotel.Behind the hotel is Upper East coast road, with lots of small restaurants  which serve food and drinks. some have happy hours with cheap cocktails and beer. There is really a very good choice of eating establishment all around the hotel. and if you want to savor real local street food. There is a food court or Hawker Center right across the road.  I can recommend the Cendol stall ( dessert), Tian Kee ( Singapore fried Hokkien prawn noodles) , or Nasi lemak at the D Authentic.

However it was acceptable and reasonable at discounted rates offered. The breakfast was very good with quality and quantity. One very significant thing was breakfast had option to be  served in rooms without room service charges this was a great concept which helps to reduce wastage and over eating in buffet also environmentally good in saving water and additional workload.

During check in, we got a complimentary upgrade to a higher floor Seaview room, with welcome packs of biscuits and packet drinks. Although this was basic, it was an unexpected lovely gesture. The room was clean, and had a nice bathtub to soak and relax.

It was in a great location, on one side were the wonderful cafes and eateries on East Coast road, on the other Way parade. East Coast park was a very short ride away.

The service staff mostly are nice and tries to be helpful.

However, personally, I think that the cost savings are too obvious. Firstly, the welcome gift was the most sadness and pathetic that I had ever seen. (A few pieces of butter cookies, chocolate bar and energy bar).

For the welcome drinks, not only it is limited in choices, there was also not enough stocks for the choice. My friend and I both wanted chilled juices, but was informed that there was only 1 left.

As the executive lounge is not opened, I can only do take away from restaurant. Again, we were offered some pathetic canapes in a box. Apart from that, we can only choose 1 drink for the takeaway. I think this does not translate to any experience of an executive lounges that I visited. Maybe hotel should pay more attention to it as often whoever guests being offered executive lounge should be considered as a more ""premium"" guests.

Lastly, the breakfast is also limited where we can choose only 1 set from 4 different sets of breakfast. I ordered the Chinese set and had to literally beg for a yoghurt from the other set and the server told me that he will make a special exemption for me this round. And the Chinese set includes a soya bean milk that I do not drink and requested to change to a juice, but was being rejected.

I checked out the hotel 2-2-2020 & en route to Singapore Cruise Terminal for my Asian cruise, when I realized that I have left my handbag with a substantial amount of cash and credit card at the hotel's room in my haste to check out the hotel. I asked the driver to call immediately to the Grand Mercure Roxy hotel to ask Manager to check my room for my handbag & to have him call us back immediately with result. The manager called back to confirm that I did left my handbag. What a relief!!! So, I hired a taxi for a round trip from Cruise terminal to hotel and back. The hotel manager went through and counted all the cash and listed it. He then requested me to confirm all cash and credit cards were there, which I did.

As for the hotel itself, the thing I remember most when writing this six months after my stay is the inexperienced staff. It was very difficult to get answers to even the most basic questions, such as where to buy a tourist pass for public transportation (a word of advise: get the pass upon arrival at the airport or you will have to travel a bit by single ticket in order to get one). This also reflected on the service as well as the information. For instance I repetedly asked to get a robe - lacking in my room, but present in my friend’s room - without getting one.

Public transport into tourist locations is by bus with stops out front of hotel. Rooms are spacious by Singapore standards & well appointed. Access to the Executive Lounge was appreciated & service in there was friendly & professional. An initial problem with our room’s plumbing/air conditioning was professionally dealt with, resulting in a change of rooms.

However, the mercure is. Ot as hip & trendy as the rest of the neighboorhood. The lobby looks uograded, so does the pool area. The room definitely not. It is functional but still has carpet on the floor, no coffemaker, bathtub with a showercurtain, very old showerhead. And one major issue, rooms are superhumid. Nothing dries in the rooms. Bathtowels and swimming stuff is still wet after a day and night of drying.

We were here for a sailing regatta so come home with a lot if wet clothes. There was a dehumidifier in our hallway which had not been in use for at least 24hrs. The water reservoir was full and no one emptied it. I brought it to our room, emptied it and seitched it back on: 88% humidity. After 1 hour we already had it on 80%.
When we were in bed by 21.20, 2 men showed up ringing our doorbell and waking up my son to ask if we had the dehumidifier in our room. Every right to ask but maybe not at that time...

I had requested for a small card with the words Happy Birthday just to wish her. The Front Office Team (special mention to Ditta) went above and beyond that to make a gorgeous hand-made card for her and also prepare a cake. Together with the Housekeeping team, they decorated the room so beautifully, making her day extra special and memorable!

When we came back the second time, my daughter had remembered the little towel bunnies that were prepared the first time, so I made a request in the booking if she could have them again. When we entered the room, there were no bunnies and she was a little disappointed. It was evening time when I called the hotel reception to ask if I could request for them. The Housekeeping department called me soon after to apologise that they could not fulfill that request that day because the person who made them was not around. However, they set a time for the room to be made up the next morning, and for some towel bunnies to pop in. We brought my daughter out the next morning, and when we came back, not only was there a family of bunnies, but a family of elephants and a towel monkey too!

I would even say that common areas have greatly improved compared to a few years  ago. We enjoy the location that is less busy than more central parts of Singapore. Proximity to the sea allows for an odd breeze to come through and it feels less damp here compared to central Singapore. Pool area is a pleasant and relaxing spot that we enjoy during our stays.

We requested a second bed for our young son and it arrived within 5 minutes of getting into our room. The same goes for our bags which were bought up almost immediately.  The free airport shuttle is awesome. We followed the instructions provided and found the transport desk at the airport where we booked onto the next shuttle. Returning to the airport at the end of our trip was just as easy, we just booked with the concierge staff after checking out.

,4.0,True,Positive,Good option for stopovers  Stayed overnight on Easter weekend for a stopover between flights.   There is a free airport shuttle but on arrival into Changi we opted for a cab as it was easier after a day of travelling. It was SGD $20 from terminal 1 and took less than half an hour.   Arriving early evening the lobby was relatively quiet but check-in took a little longer than usual. As we booked using points Le Club upgrades were not offered. The room on the 14th floor was modern and a good size with a view out to the strait of Singapore. The bathroom was a little dated and the shower over the bath was horrible. I’d rather forgo a bath for a separate shower but this seems to be standard in Singapore hotels of this age. The air conditioning was adequate but very noisy.

It’s a satisfactory hotel for something not too far from the airport on a stopover.  I was surprised to find a smartphone called a Handyphone sitting on a charger on the desk facing my bed. Apparently it’s a device to help steer consumers to restaurants, bars, and activities in Singapore. Sort of a local TripAdvisor, but on its own hardware that looks like a converted Samsung Galaxy(?). The problem is that because it’s on a smartphone platform, it’s equipped with a camera and a microphone.

,4.0,True,Positive,"Very nice hotel We stayed here as part of a package for the Singapore Grand Prix. The hotel is very comfortable and clean, staff are friendly and knowledgable. Although the hotel is not in the centre it’s easy enough to get there either by bus or taxi or a short journey to the MRT. There is a modern shopping centre across the road and it is a short walk to the beach. An extra touch in the rooms is the free use of a mobile phone which allows free international calls and internet along with special offers for attractions in Singapore. The only slight criticism was at breakfast, the choice of food was good but there seemed to be too little space for the amount of guests. This was our first time in Singapore and we will definitely be back and I wouldn’t hesitate in booking here.",2018-09-01,PreCovid,0

The staff here are as good as any you’ll find anywhere else. What drops the rating for me are two things. First the location is well away from the city centre and also from the MRT station which makes getting around more difficult than with other hotels and second there seem to be more guests than accommodation in the breakfast area. It was constantly busy and overcrowded. Checkout was very slow, again with queues and aircrew queue jumping to meet their timetables.

This motel ticks all those boxes even with the construction happening across the road from the motel. Let’s face it that is progress in a very progressive city like Singapore.   It was only a short stay but the room was excellent after the 8 hour flight from Sydney Australia.  It was even nicer that we got a upgrade from a room to a suite which really started our honeymoon of very nicely.   The room was very clean with great attention to amenities within the bathroom and kitchenette was fine.

ProsGreat access to beach parks, sand,  sun and a very long running/walking track with BBQ pits. There are also some cafes here and good toilet/shower facilities. From the hotel to the beach is a bit of a walk but fine.The parkway parade mall across the road from the hotel has everything you need food wise. Other malls, shops and markets nearby.Hotel itself is OK with a good pool on level 4. The beds are good and the deluxe room was great.  Ask for free upgrades on arrival. The staff were excellent.  Very helpful and accommodating. Free shuttle to airport very useful.  Shuttle to other places only on weekends.  Would be better if it was during the week and 2 way but was grateful. ConsTo the ecp seafood centre it's 3.5km one way to walk and so a bus would be better. Breakfast is quite expensive here but a great range.  We bought our own breakfast but due to some large inconveniences the hotel have us free breakfast. I struggled as a light sleeper here.  Noisy hallways and lots of construction for the new mrt coming next year but that will be awesome. Also lots of noise coming from above as kids were running in room.  Most nights I struggled to get to sleep and was interrupted even with earplugs. Trip to Marina Bay etc is selling half hour by bus. We took 30min bus trip to vivo city/sentosa.

Shuttle from airport is pretty good only downside is no mrt close to the hotel so you have to catch the bus outside the hotel to the mtr and go from there. Hotel does have a shuttle to the mtr but t not a return shuttle so you still need to catch the bus back. If you buy a visitor pass this will work for the bus and mtr.
Pool is a good area outside the bar area.
They are building a mtr across the road won’t be ready for a couple of years.

The size of desert was decent including ice-cream ,cake and pudding.  My husband is vegetarian so there was not many options for him. Luckily, we had an awesome chief Mr. Low Yong Seng.

It wasnt very pleasant and it went on for a good one hour +.  Thats the main reason for giving them a poor rating.

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Good but not perfect This was our third trip to Singapore in three years, and the third time we have stayed at Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy. We like it. This time my wife and I were accompanied by three young teenage boys who occupied an adjoining room.
We again stayed in Executive level rooms on the 17th floor and enjoyed access to the Executive Lounge for breakfast and evening drinks. Great for the boys. So, too, was the East@Feast Buffet Restaurant which offers a good variety of Asian and European fare of invariably good quality. Again, wonderful for teenage boys with their gargantuan appetites.
Management must be doing something right, as many staff members have been there longer than we have been visiting. Many of the long-standing staff members in the restaurant and Executive Lounge are a delight – helpful, courteous and friendly without being obsequious.
There were two things we were disappointed with. One, on the first night the king size bed in our room was so hard as to make sleep virtually impossible. The next day the very friendly housekeeper rectified the matter, but a sleepless first night following a long international flight was, to say the least, disappointing. Secondly, in spite of the fact that a third bed had been requested several days before the visit, and the request had been confirmed by the hotel, it was not in evidence when we arrived.

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Great location! My sister and I stayed at Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy for 4 nights in Mar ‘17.
It was our first time in Singapore and we couldn’t believe how convenient it was to reach places we wanted to go to in a short amount of time (Universal Studios, Sentosa, cable cars, Madame Tusaudes, Singapore Zoo, Marina bay and multiple shopping centres). Location of the hotel is perfect. It’s not in the heart of Singapore and all the touristy stuff, but you can definitely do plenty of things local to this hotel.

The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable. They were very up to date with the wallpaper and the look of the room. Wifi works well. The concierge and front desk staff are always humble and happy to help with any questions. The lobby is very nice and updated.
It’s only about 25 mins from the airport. And the check in and check out process was so quick! There was no fooling around.

The price is per night AUD, is a little expensive, we managed to get a promotional price at the time of booking. But you really pay for what you get as a 3-star hotel, it’s not really a budget priced hotel, but it really does the job as a room you stay in. After all, you spend all your time outside of the hotel, not in it.

The ONLY disappointing feedback I would have to say about our stay is that the pool was under maintenance for at least the duration of our stay. We were disappointed as we usually book in hotels that have a pool access. But other than that, I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",2017-03-01,PreCovid,0

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Benchmarking It and Setting A Standard !  Congrats ! I have just checked out (today is my check out date - la :)) from Grand Mercure Roxy, this morning about 0630 hrs.My wife and I stayed a total of 9 days and 8 nights in your hotel and i must say, it was more than a pleasurable experience.  Ultimately, its all about the benchmark you have set for the staff and they following it.  More importantly, the supervisors/ managers who are leading them.  From Wave Cafe:  where i was a daily guest for many of my meetings (though i was on leave), to:  Concierge, Front Office, Housekeeping and F&B, many have made an impression on my wife and I and will name name shortly.  The sense of duty, passion, commitment in them can be seen clearly.  To begin with i stayed in Room 1700.  :)The sense of anticipation of the guests requirement, wishes are trats that Grand Mercure Roxy must never lose.  It was clearly seen in the staff.  They have this sense of clear direction, and i strongly believe, that contributes to their sense of clarity in discharging their duties well.Wave Cafe:  Mari, Jessa, Margaux, Ellen, Kate and Lia were amongst those who served me.  Courteous, multi-tasking, ever smiling even under great pressure and stress, multpile requests from guests and walk-in customers, yet they remain steadfast and  ever smiling graciously.Concierge:  Marimuthu, Aaron, Ramlan, Zul, Lowiis and Anuar: whom i interacted with and tended to some of my calls and needs.  Efficient is the word.  Tired as they may be, BUT never displaying it.  Swift in their actions with a galant smile !  Front Office:  Xin Yi, Vivien, Jesly, Anna, Ryan, He Feng.  Front Office staff needs to have this extra ZING in them for they make or break a guests stay in the hotel.  I believe if they set it right, it will be smooth sail all the way.  COS, they are the 1st face any guests sees upon setting foot in the lobby.   You will be prpud to note that the names i mentioned above in Front Office have more than the ZING !  They have the X-TRA ZING dazzling the guests in GRM.  Pleasant disposition and however difficult the situation was, they were able to come up with solutions.  How did I know ?..................   I observe and observe very well :)During my stay, i had 2 major dinners, ie:  on 24 Dec and 26 Dec at Feast @ East.  Needless to say that the food was very good.  The variety and value for money is worth the mention.  Even the best of food would taste otherwise if the ""taste"" of service was not up to mark.  However, here it was GREAT !  Deserving special mention are:  Kelvin, Jojo, Vanan, Edison, Rajan and (pardon me:  a Malay gentleman who was there daily for breakfast........i could not recall his name - Zul ?).  They serve the many and it can be trying at time BUT they performed well above the mark !  I must also compliment the Housekeeping Dept for a good job done.  IN all the 9 days, my room was well cleaned, managed, and stocked.    I did not get their names - as i was out at work when they did made up the room but nevertheless, Housekeeping did a very good job !Away from the eyes of the frontline, Grand Mercure Roxy is blessed to have a dedicated TEAM of senior management staff.  Ronnie and Robert:  It being the festive Season, they rolled up their sleeves to assist the front line staff in discharging their duties when the crowd was overwhelming.  They were there on weekends, even public holidays to ensure  smooth operations in F&B.  They kept and eagle eye to the F&B requirements and promotion promises to ensure repeat customers.Patricia:  The EAM, whom i never realis,  it was her :).  Always on the move keeping a sharp lookout for potential troubled spots.  Leadership by example.Iskander:  He is truly the embodiment of a grounded Duty Manager.  He walks the ground and walks the ground all the way.  I observed even on the graveyard shift, he walks and checks on the various areas in the hotel.  Never missing a beat.  with a smiling persona, he mingles almost seamlessly with the guests and that makes Grand Mercure Roxy close to the hearts of many. Muthu:  Many of us forget.  We compliment those whom we can see and take others for granted.  I have heard many guests said, Grand Mercure Roxy is a safe and good hotel.  Trusted staff.   Pause for a moment......it did not just happen...... IT is there because you have an Excellent Security Manager in Muthu.  The values he transmits to the security staff.  I saw him (without he seeing me :)) on many a weekends, even on Christmas Eve he was there observing and ensuring smooth flow of ops.  Scanning the horizon for potential trouble.  Thanks  !In all, my stay was indeed a memorable one.  My wife and my sincere thanks to the staff and personnel.  Keep up the good name of Grand Mercure Roxy and the values it brings along with it.Cheers and Wishing You and Staff :  Happy New Year, 2018.God Bless.",2017-12-01,PreCovid,1

couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"OK, but it would have to be a really good deal for me to want to stay here again. This hotel is located in Katong, around 15 minutes from the airport and with a free shuttle bus. Katong is an interesting area if you want to be away from the usual big Singapore. It's a residential area, seemingly well-to-do with some old world Singapore housing as well as newer up market housing, restaurants and shopping all within walking distance of the hotel.
Compared with the six other hotels we stayed in during our recent trip, our check-in at the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy could only be described as luke warm. The Roxy seems a little tired and the business centre to which the hotel is attached is very tired. The hotel Lobby is a somewhat uninspiring area with uncomfortable seating and a very ordinary cafe stuck in one corner. Our room was generally clean, large and well appointed and the wifi was good. The TV was on the small side and the bed a little hard. The bathroom was satisfactory although the shower was in the bath with a shower curtain (not a fan of shower curtains), the toilet pan looked stained or dirty and my wife would have liked better lighting when she was applying her make-up (a common problem even in far more expensive hotels).
The corridors are big and wide and unfortunately echoing and every noise transmits into the rooms through their thin entrance doors and the large gaps beneath. So, lifts/elevators can be heard in the quiet hours and noisy guests can be a problem. (A group of guests on our floor decided it was a good idea to visit each other late at night, slamming doors and talking loudly such that sleep was impossible. - As a positive, a call to reception did result in hotel security quickly attending and speaking with the offending party with a good outcome. However, the arrival of a basketball team on our floor the second night did not bode well for sleep that night either.)
We did not breakfast at the hotel but we did have dinner in the restaurant. I chose New Zealand lamb cutlets with vegetables. Certainly not gourmet! Both cutlets were very small, very fatty and hardly any meat and the entire meal suffered from an excess of the oil it was cooked in. Can't say that the glass of wine I had with it was very good either but, at least the beer by the pool beforehand was nice and cold.",2017-12-01,PreCovid,0

Meant to be a time of lazing by the pool and chilling out turned into a great adventure.  Were greeted by the best hotel staff, very friendly and helpful. Room was very large with a massive bed. We got a 10th room so got a good view over the pool and surrounding area. Transport was very close with the bus outside the door. Once we worked out the transport system, good old maps on our phone, getting around was very easy and Orchard Rd got a hammering by the wife.

What the website doesn't' tell you is the amount of construction and roadworks happening in the area at the moment (the hotel has no control over this), it does make walking anywhere from the hotel a little more difficult and one of the taxi drivers we had couldn't work out how to get in.  Check in was relatively smooth, as was check out - efficient if not really that friendly.  The lounge was okay, as was the pool area.  Unfortunately, our room was not so great.  We had a pool access room which ended up being tucked down a weird little alley, with no sunlight, which meant the room was very dark all of the time, it also smelt damp and musty and had significant amounts of mold on the ceiling and in the",2017-08-01,PreCovid,0

The shuttle arrived 15 mins before time, but the driver didn't allow us to get in till the scheduled time. We were standing and waiting infront of the van, and he was reading newspaper! Too much for the hospitality!  2.

My room was spacious and comfortable and was always clean and tidy, thanks to Sahinder, one of the cheerful and helpful housekeeping team.
I know some people maybe dissatisfied with the distance from the metro station, but there was a good taxi and bus service from right outside. I liked the location, plenty of good restaurants close by, a mall across the road and a nice coastal setting is only ten or fifteen minutes away by foot.
The food was good. I would like to have seen more of a selection at the breakfast buffet, but that's my personal taste.
I will stay there again no doubt.",2017-04-01,PreCovid,0

business,5.0,True,Positive,"Best stay for a business trip Put up at Grand Mercure Roxy from 02-05 May 2017 (4 Stars Hotel with 6 Stars Service) and had a great stay there. The room is very clean (Usually when staying under Corporate Rate, some hotel will give you the worse room they have but NOT at Grand Mercure Roxy)

Hotel location is good be it traveling by taxi or bus (Bus stop just in front of hotel and it goes direct to Orchard road) and will be even better when the MRT is up. Hotel provide free shuttle service from airport to hotel (vice versa)

On arrival check-in staff was fantastically friendly, courteous and cheerful, felt so at home already when at check-in. The staff at the concierge are very helpful, informative, friendly and forever willing to assist. The waitress at the Wave Cafe are friendly and cheerful too. Grand Mercure Roxy had the most friendly, cheerful, helpful, courteous and best staff in the hotel industry.

I would specially like to compliment the following staff of Grand Mercure Roxy for being outstanding in their work which made their guest feel so welcome and so at home. They are He Feng (Front Desk), Ramlan & Marimuthu (Concierge)

It's also well located in relation to Changi airport, and has a shuttle - though a taxi is not prohibitively expensive either, if you don't wish to wait. OK, so the new metro line is being built next to the hotel at the moment (and will be for a while more to come).  But honestly that has not bothered me noise or mess-wise at all.

The breakfast in the hotel was also very good. There was plenty to choose from and the restaurant was never crowded. The only fault I could find was if people were  talking in the hallway you could hear them at night.  All in all I would recommend this hotel and only wish we could have stayed longer.

Some of this feedback is personal opinion, the buffet breakfast offers a restrained selection for the space in the restaurant this could be expanded far further than what it currently is. Only kids cereals are on offer, adults do not need rice bubbles and coco pops.
The quality and appearance of the buffet is poor. Rooms continue to be good, clean, well equipped and comfortable, rock hard beds we thought. The pool area is and felt dirty , smokers left overs , glasses , bottles and really needs a major overhaul. The hotels photographer deserves an award for making that look good. Despite the photos looking differently the pool fits 2 people swimming comfortable any more than that it is too crowded, it is not long or wide. The shopping centre across the road has a Giant super market and a marks and spencer and a food court with local food only. Better options are behind the hotel in the main Katong street area.

If you don't want to go down to Orchard Road you will find dozens of shops in Parkway and mostly the prices are more competitive as Parkway is more like a typical suburban shopping centre.

Positive:
- Detailed service, hand-written well-wishes for my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary. Complimentary wine and cake is a bonus.
- Decor and furnishing is new all over the hotel (except the carpark).
- Service staff was attentive, initiative, and responsive. No need for myself to call for assistance, especially when my hands was full with baby stuff and had no hands to open the swing door, the staff will hold the door open for me.
- Breakfast variety of options was decent at the Level 3 common restaurant.
- executive lounge have a nice view of the coast of Singapore.
- gym was new and well-maintained.
- Complimentary parking for guests.
Negative:
- There was no elevator to the hotel carpark. Not wheelchair-friendly, and in my case, pram-friendly. I had to carry pram and luggage up the carpark stairs for check-in,
- The amenities was missing shaver and cream. I didn't have time to ask the staff, so I went without shave for the 2 nights.
- The baby playpen provided by the hotel was clean, but it was a bit too low for our 2 month old, so in the end, the baby shared the bed with us. I was expecting a sturdy wooden baby cot that can adjust height.
- Breakfast options can be better at the executive lounge, so we don't have to go down to level 3 common restaurant for breakfast. It was comparatively nosier at Level 3 for our baby to sit down quietly so we can enjoy our breakfast.
- Missing my favorite poached eggs and hashbrowns to breakfast menus.

I had problem with sink, it was fixed right away, fridge was old and water inside, but staff cleaned right away, shower curtain smelled like an old rag, but once I asked it was changed right away. Cause of that I would stay again, but I do hope property will get upgraded. They do have nice small pool, quite big rooms, free shuttle to/from airport which helps. I had quite a problem since I wanted to give them 4****, but then it showed ""very good"" so I lowered to 3***.  I did not write here all good or bad things, but if that hotel is within your budget you should stay here.",2016-09-01,PreCovid,0

The surrounding shopping/ dining amenities had variety galore to suit palates of all nationalities. One can also shop in peace free of harassment and safely for solo females. Hotel staff were friendly helpful and welcoming. I was given a complimentary upgrade and lovely Kingsize bed all to myself. The room was comfy with temperature control and room service very efficient. I would definitely stay again if I had to visit this vibrant city.,2016-09-01,PreCovid,0

family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Everything works just as expected 2D1N Staycay with my family in a Studio Suite on the 11th floor overlooking the pool from 10 & 11 Sep and my opinions are:
Room : Spacious (obviously as it is a studio suite)
Lounge Floor : Offering excellent views of ECP
Location : Pretty Convenient, depending on what you are looking for. For shoppers, Parkway Parade is just across the road. Foodies don't need to look far, with the hawker center nearby
Breakfast : Feast@East variety and selection was good, above average
Service : Would have been good if staff service levels could be further improved on. At the point of checking in, the guy behind the counter didn't bother to GST (Greet, Smile & Ty). Similar treatment accorded during check out but by a lady.
Welcome Drinks : None
Wifi : Funny thing is the Wifi p/w changes (I presume weekly) and due to this cut over during the Sat and Sun stay, my Wifi connection got cut off! To start off with, since the hotel knew the staycay is over two days, they could have informed me in advance, or did something not to inconvenience guests
Newspapers : Not made readily available for Studio Suite guests. Need to get a copy from the F&B outlets.
Laundry : No provision of free laundry like some other hotels provide. However, they provide coin operated laundry machines at level 4, same level as the pool
In summary, everything works just as expected, and if expectations are kept in check, all is satisfactory.",2016-09-01,PreCovid,1

couple,2.0,True,Negative,"Poor to Average at best. Third time back - decided to give it another chance after not too good experiences previously. Check-in - Unenthusiastic welcome, even though early Check-In and Late Checkout was granted to 3pm. Upgrade was granted from Superior to Deluxe Room. Welcome Drinks offered.

Now here comes the not so good parts. As an LCAH Gold member, you are being treated as any other guest in the whole hotel - no extra mile nothing.

1. No welcome amenity / VIP Treatment as promised.
2. Don't bother with getting an Executive or Deluxe Room as there are no differences other than an overmattress, lounge access and higher floor (I stayed in an executive room before). Honestly, their staff can't even explain to me their differences.
3. Deluxe room with the supposedly with a higher floor, you end up facing someone else's rooftop.

Here came the other annoyances:
1. Coffee Machine wasn't dispensing coffee at all at breakfast. Staff eating at the side didn't bother to help (Off Duty I presume) after noticing my and another guest's difficulty- 2 cups of milk wasted. Manager who came to help didn't offer apologies. As I was rushing off for a meeting, I asked if I could grab the latte in a takeaway cup as I was done for breakfast. A flat no, we do not allow coffee takeaways. Really guys, breakfast was already included in my rate and you assumed that I would still want to rip you off?
2. WiFi was disconnected as passcode changed (I presume weekly) on Sunday morning.
3. 1 hour before check-out, I asked if I could extend late check-out to 4pm as I just came back from a long meeting and I wanted to change and enjoy my welcome drink. Answer given was - ""Hey Sir, we have already given you a late 3pm checkout and an upgrade. 4pm is not possible."". I was taken aback by the response that made the hotel sound so stingy. So I had to bargain for 3.30pm. Card Key didn't work at 3pm and I had to go back to front desk to configure the key. Later I found out from another staff that the hotel is not even at full occupancy. Stingy - very stingy.

Saving Grace:
1. Bar staff was friendly.
2. Breakfast spread was good. There was even a Japanese counter which the salmon tasted great.

Unless they improve, there are many options available around the neighbourhood - eg: Village Hotel Katong, Hotel Indigo and Holiday Inn. Perhaps I should not have expect a lot from a Grand Mercure - however, I have had many good experiences in APAC in even Novotel with a higher standard from their staff that leaves this Grand Mercure much to be desired...",2016-09-01,PreCovid,1

They are refurbishing the restaurant and are up front about their apologies for the fact it is relocated in the ballroom. No problem with that.

Opposite the hotel is Parkway Parade mall where you can find lotsa places to dine in. Getting there is no hassle as you only have to get cross using an overhead bridge beside the hotel's driveway..

The service at the reception is slightly below par and not of Accor Standard but i do recognize the fact that it is a trainee but should not be at the Accor Member check-in Counter.

The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport, even though it looks closer on the map. The same is true for most of the airport hotels since linear distance and driving distance are very different when navigating Changi. Rooms are quiet, clean and comfortable and the free wifi is reasonably fast.  The airport shuttle schedule is a bit odd. If you happen to be flying through T1, the shuttle runs every 30 minutes. But T2 and T3 are both hourly so you may be waiting a while. The morning shuttle service starts at 6:30am, which is relatively late if you have an early morning flight.

As long as you give plenty of time and leave early your accommodation options and price ranges open up (keeping in mind cab/train fares). Otherwise you may just be tempted to spend a little more for the convenience of staying at the Crowne Plaza and walk to and from the terminals.

The bathroom came with a bathtub. Needless to say, it's a favourite for our 2 gals. They enjoyed themselves very much in the swimming pool. The pools come with different depth to cater for different level of swimmers. For those who just want to chill by the swimming pool, you can also order refreshment or food from the Breez Bistro.

This is the only hotel in Katong that has a viewing deck at the Executive Lounge to dine and gaze at the sea. If you are looking for dining options, the hotel has 4 high quality restaurants and bar to choose from. Looking for elsewhere to explore?

The hotel is an ideal place to stay with friendly helpful staff, bus shuttle to and from the airport, great all you can eat breakfast and a nice room with a king size bed. Transport in Singapore is fantastic once you purchase an EZlink card that covers both trains and buses. The hotel provides free shuttle bus to the nearest MRT train station and there are buses close by, either in front of and behind the hotel. We dined in the hotel's Breez Bistro Bar taking advantage of the free welcome drink and 30% off the total food bill. The food was excellent.

The hotel is conveniently located - both the city and Changi only about 10-12 mins away in each direction.

The free shuttle service is a great convenience (especially from Terminal 1 with service every 30 mins).

The hotel rooms have been renovated and is well appointed with power outlets that accept the two pin US power plugs without a need for adapters.   There is free WiFi both in the rooms and in the lobby.  The buffet breakfast is well worth the add-on price - lots of choices of authentic local or western breakfast items.

We had booked one of the rooms on the Executive Levels so it was quite spacious.   We did not quite like: the age of the room - it was very outdated especially the bathroom.

It is also conveniently located opposite a great hawker pavillion flogging tasty Singaporean street food for a couple of bucks a bowl. For a one night layover, you can't ask for more.

The complimentary shuttle service from the airport was easy and trouble free, although be prepared to lift your own bags up into the bus. The check-in staff were friendly and courteous as were the wait staff at the poolside bar for the complimentary welcome drink. The staff in the executive lounge warmly welcomed us for complimentary hors derves from 6-8pm, which were plentiful and of very good quality. Our room was well appointed, clean and very comfortable. We took a short taxi ride to the Marina Sands precinct at night. A beautiful location,  a word to the wise, take your passport if you want to have a look at the casino, they won't let you in without it, unfortunately concierge didn't let us know this when they booked us a cab. We enjoyed a cocktail at one of the bars outside and watched the spectacular laser water show at the waters edge. Amazing. Ask concierge the time details for the show as we just struck it lucky.

Stayed here with my family for three days and we were given a pool access room as the ocean view rooms were taken. The staff offered to upgrade us to an ocean room the next day but we liked our room and did not want to move.

Unlike some other hotels we have stayed in lately we were quite happy with our modern room so did not have to switch after check-in. The hotel was gracious enough to give us two baby cribs for our children so this is a great place to stay for family as well as business or leisure. They also gave us a free late check-out.

The pool is a nice respite from the bustling city and it is clean. There is modern health and clean club as well as a bar on the same level 4. There is also a snack shop on the reception floor.

The hotel is very good, clean and silent.
I have to say that the food is very good, with a great breakfast with many disches for food and several bevrages and drinks.
Also the restaurant is good; I tried it three times; they serve food at buffet and there is an extremely variety and range of food and beverages too, not always the same as every time I had dinner there, the food was different.
Internet is free of charge and it works; frankly during the evening the speed connection was quite slow with no chance to upgrade to a better connection speed. It is free and it works; but it is not good for movies in streaming.
The hotel is 15 mins from Expo by taxi and 30 min from city center by taxi as well.
There is a free shuttle service from hotel to airport, every 30 mins or every hour, depending by the terminal you go.

business,3.0,True,Neutral,"Staff Shortcomings and Pesky Details Limit Rating On a very short business trip to Singapore, I picked this 4* property located about halfway between the city and the airport. Surrounding the hotel is a nice, upscale neighbourhood with shops and restaurants galore. Perhaps a reasonable location for a tourist visit to Singapore as well, if you want to be out of all the traffic and hubbub.

Hotel is running a ""free airport shuttle"" service, but it doesn't start running until many of the international services to the USA have already left, so I took an (expensive) taxi.

Three details marred an otherwise nice hotel.

The thermostat in my room was mounted UPSIDE DOWN. Not convenient, especially when adjusting the temperature in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit.

Much of the staff, encouraged to address guests with their name, continued to call me ""Mr. Jim"" instead of using my surname. Bad cultural training.

The third issue was this Accor hotel's way of ""recognising and honouring"" my platinum status with their company. On check in I was presented with a voucher (coupon) entitling me to a ""$1 Beverage"" if I purchased their (overpriced) buffet! A soft drink isn't included in the almost $30 buffet price? Such a miserly discount for my loyalty to this chain?

This gives you access to the executive lounge area which is great for evening drinks (which are complementary between 6 and 8). Breakfast is either served here or in the buffet (great selection).

My room was spacious, impeccably clean and had a nice view. The staff was very friendly, polite and eager to help. The hotel is conveniently located on the East Coast Road. There is a big mall right opposite the hotel and there are plenty of restaurants around. There is one East Coast Sea Food Centre not far from the hotel and they have some really amazing sea-food dishes there. Walking distance from the hotel is the East Coast Park, perfect for taking a stroll by the beach. Downtown isn’t that far from the hotel either. I liked the breakfast; there used to be a rather wide assortment of dishes to choose from. The in-room dining menu was quite varied too –although I would have liked to see more vegetarian dishes there. It was still pretty good and hence I am not complaining. One of the really impressive things about this hotel is that it has a launderette. This was a significantly cheaper alternative to the regular hotel laundry given the warm and humid weather of Singapore where you need more frequent washing and drying of clothes.

Comfy bed and no noise. Lobby area was nice and all the staff we met were very helpful, including the information desk.

I like the bar and grill restaurant as they serve delicious international grills which are not only tasty but quite affordable in a five star hotel. The staff is warm and courteous and very helpful. The buffet breakfast spread is adequate and is good for veg and non veg. The only thing which I feel needs improvement is that the rooms needs renovation now.,2015-07-01,PreCovid,0

There were a few average shops and malls nearby but not up to central Singapore standards. The hotel was starting to age and in need of refurbishment but still clean and serviceable for a business trip.

The pool is a bit boring, but this is not intending to be a resort hotel. The best part is the location: as far as possible from tacky tourist haunts!

Maybe because they are quite old for bell boy standard, but at least they can wait when the hotel shuttle arrive, and assist guest with their luggage. When I see the bell boy, I really dont mind carrying my own bag down the shuttle but at least they prepare a trolley or something so I can put my bag in trolley and just wheel it down.

We stayed here on the way back from Vietnam - the location of this place is brilliant, a short ride from Changi airport, close to attrations like the night safari, and Singapore Zoo. It has a mall accoross the road - a beach down the road, eateries etc nearby. It is a bit of a ride into down town Singapore or Sentosa (Maybe 25mins) but for tourists like us even this was good as we got to see the city - now to the Hotel

Service here is great, you feel almost luxury in some of this hotel. We had three rooms on a high floor - 2 pool view rooms (Also looking over city), and a breathtaking sea view room (Which we had- YUSSS!) The room looked over the sea and the city giving amazing vistas.

The rooms here a modern, clean and spacious, with the facilities you need and want to enfoy your stay - Fantastic pool as well open until late at night for night swimming. The place has a good bar and restaurant, and by virtue of having bought a room a free drink from the bar is yours.

I stayed in superior room with 2 x single beds which i think is equivalent size of 2x double bed. Overall, it's a pleasant stay. The only downside is there maybe some miss communication between the free shuttle bus drive with the concierge staffs. At the reservation book it clearly marked that the bus to T3 is 1 hour apart. I booked the 8:00am which I thought only go T3. Apparently the bus driver dropped every passenger to T1 and blame us not telling him that we need to T3. I purposely booked this time and I thought the bus only goes to T3. The bus driver blamed us to go on bus too late, with too many luggages, delay his time to go on next trip, no time to go toilet, etc. We were late for 5 mins, because we were waiting for our luggages to come down from our room.

There are always cabs available but the free shuttle works, just be familiar with how to get it at the airport as there is a bit of a procedure with no real signage.

Breakfast was excellent as the buffet really catered for all tastes and was plentiful - very busy but still good quality. Bedroom was spacious, functional and clean with a good bathroom. Staff pleasant, our bags were portered from the shuttle and kept in a secure room until we had been checked in - by the time we made it to our rooms they were already delivered and waiting for us. Nearby Mall with many places to eat was handy. If holidaying in Singapore for more than a couple of days I think it would perhaps be frustrating to have to travel to everything but taxi's were cheap and the MRT handy and only 15 mins",2013-12-01,PreCovid,0

Breakfast was not bad but it was very busy when I stayed there.   I have to give the cleanliness a 3 only because of the swimming. My eyes hurt a lot the moment I started swimming and it was red when I exited 20min later, and I was wearing goggles. My partner's eyes hurt more than usual as he swims without goggles.

Knowing that their last scheduled airport shuttle was arriving at about the same time with a full complement of passengers, one would expect them to be more prepared.

Compared to the Grand Mercure Shanghai this hotel just misses the standard.

However the room was very quiet at night, the bed extremely comfortable, just right for a stopover. Took the hotel airport shuttle in the morning, it was timely and the driver friendly.

There are many local eateries close by in Joo Chiat Rd and East Coast Road - easy 5 to 10 mins walk. I ate local with some friends for dinner - if you don't need Orchard Rd and high end stores, this is a nice location.

family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Mediocre service & standards This was my second stay at this hotel. I previously stayed there in September 2012 and was satisfied, thus returned to the same hotel this year.

I usually arrive with the late night/early morning Delta flight, so the complimentary shuttle comes in handy (no need to change money in the airport for a taxi nor budget for the late night cab fare to the hotel). It runs until 2am. This time when we arrived from USA to Tokyo I noticed that our flight to Singapore was delayed and immediately sent an email to the hotel asking if they can send one more shuttle (given the flight delay) at 2:15am. The email was sent over 8 hours before our arrival, but upon reaching Singapore I found out that the hotel did not reply. Ok, so we took a taxi.

Arrived at the hotel at about 2:30-2:40AM. Checked in and out of curiosity asked if they received my email. The receptionist fetched the manager on duty who responded in a very indifferent tone that the shuttle service is outsourced, so no exceptions on the schedule can be made regardless of circumstances. No sign of any politeness or apology for not bothering to reply to a guest's email.

The room (US$180 per night) was a standard room and looked very tired (unlike the room we stayed at in 2012). But aside from that, I immediately noticed obvious signs of a poor cleaning service in the bathroom (hair on the floor and the bath tub) and as well as the stained sheets on the bed. Called the reception desk and was connected to the manager. He promised to send housekeeping. It was too late at night though to wait until they clean the room properly, so I asked for another room. After getting the keys to the second room (which turned out to be a similar very tired room) and moving the luggage there I found out that the AC there is not working. Again found hair on the floor, but this time it was a hair ball right beside the room door. Maintenance came to fix the AC and took care of the problem. I did not want to try my luck for the third time, so stayed in that room and cleaned the hair myself (amazing considering it's not a 1 star hotel).

All we were offered by the manager was a late checkout (considering we checked in at 3am that was a bit helpful, but I would have preferred a newer and most importantly cleaner room).

All in all, I don't see any value in staying in this hotel on my future trips to Singapore anymore. It's overpriced considering the room dirtiness, indifference of management, and the location.",2013-09-01,PreCovid,0
couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Good accommodation close to Changi Airport. Grand Mercure Roxy is a good hotel for a stop over in Singapore and has the advantage of a free bus transfer from the airport to the hotel. It is located about half way between the city centre and the airport and is easy to reach during peak hour traffic which can be a problem in the early evening when most business closes. The rooms are very clean and spacious and the bed is comfortable. The bathroom had a shower over the bath and is also very clean. The breakfast is 5 star and there is plenty to choose from. We used this hotel on the way to London and also on the way back. There is a good sized swimming pool. To get to the city centre and the Orchard Road area the quickest way is to take a taxi which will cost about $15 off peak and about $20 at other times. Room rates are a lot cheaper than hotels in the centre and is good as a stop over hotel if you are breaking your journey to Europe or elsewhere. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for a stop over in Singapore.

family,5.0,True,Positive,"Free shuttle bus helps a lot to transport Comparing to other accor hotels in Singapore, I think this hotel offers the best value and service. It is true that it is far from MRT, however the free shuttle bus to airport and one way free shuttle bus to orchad rd or Marina Bay helps to go to downtown. There are some bus in front of hotel, but it may take longer times.

It was very busy hotel, because it is used for airlines aircrew, so I got the room at 2:30 as it was promised. The service is excellent and including free access internet. It was suprised to me, that the hotel provided an extra bed to me. The breakfast is ok.

The hotel is a cross Parkway parade shopping center and bank, so relatively I can find what I need in the shopping center and there is a small food court besides the hotel that are a favourite place to eat.

The warm swimming pool and gym are favourite places in afternoon. So it is a liitle bit crowded. One weakness there is no changing room,",2013-07-01,PreCovid,0
family,3.0,True,Neutral,"An 'OK' option Traveling with 2 children we had problems finding a hotel able to provide us accommodation at an affordable price for our required dates. We finally selected the Grand Mercure Roxy as they were able to provide us with a family room for two adults and two children without breaking the bank.

The hotel itself is out of the centre of Singapore - around half way between the CBD and the airport with various free shuttle buses to help you get around. We actually only found out about the free airport shuttle bus after reading a review here on Trip advisor (we found no other reference to it anywhere). Finding out about the shuttle once we arrived was a bit of a chore and we had to finally get the train to another terminal in order to find the relevant desk. Eventually though we were ushered onto a bus and found ourselves at the hotel after around a 20 minute drive.

At check-in though we were hit with a shock. Our family room was actually a twin room with only 2 single beds. After 18 hours traveling with small kids I wasn't in the mood for arguing but there was no way we could accept 2 single beds to sleep 4 people - especially when we produced our booking confirmation which showed that we clearly booked a room for 4 people.
The receptionist was sympathetic but insisted that such a room did not exist and offered an alternative room with 3 beds; better but still not what we had booked. Eventually the manager again apologised and confirmed that no such room existed and that the only option would be a suite with additional beds added, which we could have at a price which we were not willing to pay. Having pre-paid the booking we couldn't even walk away, and as it was very late we were somewhat held to ransom. We eventually accepted a twin room (no upgrade) with a king size and a single, and accepted that one child would have to sleep in the king with my wife and I. Not what we paid for or wanted!! As we accepted I requested that the hotel credit us a free breakfast for our inconvenience. The reply from the manager was a polite but clear NO. So far then the staff were very polite but given the situation they were in my opinion very unprofessional.

The hotel itself was very probably quite magnificent in its prime. The decor, layout, and general appeal must have been great a few years ago. By now though it is looking quite tired and in need of refurbishment as we saw plenty of flaking paint, stained carpets, pipes coming out of the walls, limescale etc. Nothing major but not something you would expect to see in a hotel of this class. I believe that some rooms have been refurbished yet we never came across any part of the hotel that wasn't in need of an upgrade. Our room echoed this same theme; it was absolutely fine - I just wish we had been in it a few years earlier when it would have been quite wonderful instead of a little worn out.

The breakfast buffet (which we had to pay for at $20 per person) was excellent. The usually array of options from full english to asian, fruit, cereals etc was appealing and although it felt expensive (lunch is only $14!!!) we felt it was worth it. There are other eating options right next to the hotel and more in a shopping mall on the opposite side of the main road.

The hotel offers various shuttles to the airport (every 30 minutes approximately) and to the nearest MRT station. This second shuttle is a great way to get into the city but unfortunately there are few of these and the last leaves at 11am. There were no return shuttles that we were aware of. We found the best option for getting into the city was to catch the number 36 bus which picks up and drops off right outside the hotel.

Finally the hotel offers an outdoor pool which is magnificent and very welcome after a long day in the city. Though it closes at around 10pm we were able to make use of it each evening if only for half an hour or so and found it an excellent finish to a day of sight seeing. There are however no changing facilities at the pool; you must change in your room.

All in all then this is an OK hotel that is a little overdue for a refit. I would possibly have considered staying here again but the problem with the room and the lack of flexibility of the management mean this is most definitely off my list and I wouldn't recommend it.",2013-08-01,PreCovid,0

We had breakfast everyday in the Feast @ East Restaurant, the food choices were great with a range of cuisines to satisfy all. The service in the restaurant was excellent, if you are really lucky you will get Vin looking after your table. This young man was a pleasure to deal with and nothing was too much trouble.

Every afternoon after a long day of sightseeing we visited the Wave Cafe Wine Bar and were treated to expert service from Faran. After the first day Faran knew exactly what our order was and we just had to say ""the usual"" and it was on our table promptly.

We had connecting rooms which was great for convenience and planning our next day's journey and being able to close up at night was a bonus. Both the rooms we booked were spacious and clean and were serviced daily. The room rate included breakfast, free internet, king size bed in one room and 2 king singles in the other room. Great all round value.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to people traveling to Singapore either on a holiday or a business trip.

My wife didn't like the hotel then, saying there's an old carpet smell.Last Sunday (14 Jun), my family had a stay at the hotel.  To be honest, it wasn't our preference, but we took it because our Accor complimentary stay voucher is expiring by end June.  To our surprise, the hotel had surpassed our expectations!  The room is nice, newly renovated, and definitely no old carpet smell.  The room is also spacious, big enough for us to setup an air-pump bed for our kids.  We asked for an extra pillow, and the service lady give us two pillows.  We had an enjoyable dinner and explore the katong area just a short walk from the hotel.  We had good sleep in the night, and wake up late the next day.   Overall, it had been a wonderful stay at the hotel.

They made the meal on both occasions. Very helpful as were other staff - Gabriel & Deep, especially when they realise you have a specific dietary request - not too difficult - speak to the chef and make arrangements.  All much the same as Kelvin has always been - demonstrating his enormous skills. In addition to all of this, having not slept much the night before with a very sore ear, which has been acting up for some weeks, but not of major concern to doctors, I asked the concierge (Wish I could remember his name - I will try to find out) where I could see a Doctor and use a credit card to pay. He was absolutely wonderful - a number of telephone calls later and he had me an appointment with a specialist in Ear, Nose & Throat in about 45 mins. He told me Taxi was the only way and even had the first taxi at the hotel take me to the hospital. Arrived just in time and the specialist did what should have been done a week ago at a hospital in the city I was visiting at the time.

I don't know if anyone would agree with me, I notice all the new Singapore's hotels are building smaller and smaller rooms, getting closer to the capsule hotels like in Japan.

I booked a studio suite which cost a little more but has a pool view and lots of space in the room. Efficient and friendly check-in. The room has renovated so I have no major issue. My only problem is with the light and temperature control panel. We tried to set at 24 degree but it kept changing to 42 degree (it wasn't really 42 degree so we were not toasted). A couple of lights would suddenly lit up in the middle of the night. The executive lounge was under renovation and was placed in a temporary room.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Stayed 3 nights/4 days - loved every minute! The best 2 things about this hotel is that:
1. the free airport shuttle - definately a money and time saver! It leaves the the Hotel/airport every hour (I think its every hour - but not between midnight and 7am).
2. The shopping malls across the road

That's not to distract from the hotel which was great - we arrived at 7.15am in the morning after a long flight. We knew we could not check in so early and were going to drop off our bags so we could do some sightseeing etc. But we were so tired, we diecided to wait on the lounge chairs in reception (my wife went to sleep in my lap!) until the room was ready.
Reception did the best they could, and by about 9.30am we got a room early - on othe 15th floor.
They warned us of renovations but since we were out every day, and the renovations finished I think every day at 6.00pm, we didnt notice.
The room was sufficient to make everything comfortable and the inclusion of free wifi was a definate advantage.
We loved the shopping malls across the road and my wife bought some high quality clothes at the cheapest price! That made our bank account very happy! Hahaha
The big mall (on the right) has a great food court - we ate lots of different meals we would not ordinarily try.
The pool is quite warm (not surprising) and we had a wonderful dinner pool side - it was a 5 course dinner at a special price.

What's great about this hotel:  Mr. Marimuthu, the concierge, provided excellent service in helping me locate my lost luggage--at 3am in the morning!  He was so courteous and reliable, it was wonderful having someone look out for me in a difficult situation.2.  What's good about this hotel:  While this is not a luxurious hotel, it most certainly is a very good airport hotel.  The free shuttle is a nice feature, as is the free internet.  These are meaningful conveniences for the business traveler.  (Beware though that shuttle pick-ups and drop offs are regular but not frequent.)  Additionally, the hotel's proximity to the Marine Parade shopping mall across the street is convenient. 3.  What's not so good about this hotel:  The towels, especially the hand towels, are dingy and soiled, it's past time to replace them.  The rooms are clean but the housekeeping staff should give more attention to cleaning the coffee mugs more thoroughly.  These are details which make a difference--this should not be a hotel where you have to wash the dishes before using them!Finally, about the rooms:  the king bed superior room is the same as the king bed deluxe room.  The only difference is that the latter is on a higher floor (without a nice view, so it does not matter), and you get a bathrobe and clock with the deluxe.

Still very convenient to Airport, and has great shopping Centres across the road from Hotel.
Convenient to shop......snack....haircut etc etc.
No real need to go to City Center for such a short stopover.

We reserved our rooms online. 2 rooms in total for 3 nights. Followed all requirments and gave our credit card details. However at the check in we were made to block off $2000.00 from our credit card. Not a good enough explaination was given as to why by the front desk lady named Precious.
I have stayed at the Hilton, Pan Pacific, Intercontinental and Rydges Hotels and none of these hotels ask for such a large block on customer's credit cards. A credit card imprint is taken yes and perhaps $100, but never have I come across a $2000 block, if it were not for my father who was travelling with us to loan us that $2000 we would not have any spending money for our holiday.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Fantastic hotel on city fringe. I highly recommend! Overall, the hotel was very good, and we have no reservations in providing a favourable recommendation.

We stayed in a King Bed Executive room for 3 nights, with breakfast included.

Pros:

Breakfast buffet was excellent, and I have possibly eaten the best ever omelet in my life.

The service from the staff was exceptional.

We received a complimentary trip to the airport

All rooms are provided with free internet (Wifi and Ethernet).

The bed was huge and very comfortable.

The TV was modern, with 16:9 aspect ratio with access to the back of the TV to input VGA / RCA (i.e. connect my laptop to the screen)

We received a complimentary bottle of red wine and dessert because we were on our honeymoon.

We ordered room service, and it arrived within 15 minutes and was delicious.

Cons:

Location - it is approx 20 - 30 minutes out of the main CBD, which may be preferable for some people. We paid about SGD$15 for a taxi to get into town, or we caught the bus for about SGD$2 each way.

Menu prices in restaurants and room service are exclusive of the 7% GST and 10% Service Charge. I learnt that it is customary for prices to be quoted like this in Singapore, however it makes more sense to quote the bottom line to customers, since it is highly unlikely that customers are registered for GST.

Prices for food, drinks and services were moderate.

Bottom Line:

It is a fantastic hotel on the city fringe. I appreciated this hotel more once I understood the public transport system.

Tips:

If allowed, make most use of the Executive Lounge on Level 17. There are drinks available, can check out, or just relax there.

Bus 36 takes you to Orchard Road (bus stop just outside the front entrance)
Bus 10 takes you to Sentosa Island (bus stop behind the hotel)

I don't have to mention the neighborhood shopping center with very tasty food court just cross the street. This is almost the main reason me and other people choose to stay in Roxy Mercure, I believe. However, this was one of the most busy period , from Christmas to almost new year. And as another hotel next door is under renovation, Roxy Merxure is probably the only hotel at the east side.

So here is the problem, I found one of the towel with stain on, and after the first day, I found hairs still on the floor in the bathroom. The pillow had smell of bleach, called the front desk, it took long time for them to response. Breakfast was hardly enjoyable, because it was always full of people. The worse was on their 9th floor, some internal renovation was in progress. I have been told if I heard any noise during weekend or public holiday, I should let the hotel know.

The rooms were very nice, clean, quiet, and we had a good nights rest. The breakfast buffet was also quite good with a nice variety of western and Asian selections - dragon fruit was a nice surprise in the fruit section! The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout our stay.

One caution if booking online: your room will be prepaid, immediately charged to your credit card, and not refundable under any circumstances. Our flight out of the US was delayed 8 hours due to weather. This meant that we missed other connections and could not get to Singapore for our first night (the airline put us up in Tokyo that night). As a result, I was out $370 (two rooms) for the night we missed. No refund. No rebooking for our return transit stay. Nothing.

When I got to the hotel, I was greeted by a nice fellow called Jack. He was very polite and accommodating. I booked online and it seems that a lot of information I selected online didn't come through the system and he was kind enough to fix it up and arranged for an extra bed in my room for free.

The free wifi is nice and fast and the beds are quite comfortable, firm but not too hard.

If I had to nick-pick, there were only 5 towels in the rooms instead of 6 I specified when I made the booking, probably due to the missing information that didn't come through from the online booking.

They have free shuttle buses into town and local buses depart right in front.  Taxis are cheap anyway and nothing is far away.

Check in took an age (around 25 minutes) and the room was disappointing.  I was given a room with twin beds instead of the king I had booked, and told I had been upgraded.  However, my colleagues actually had the rooms booked - technically two classes below mine, and they were clearly better.  The carpets were grubby and I found hairs in the bathroom.  I complained and was reminded of the 'upgrade' I had been lucky enough to receive.  Throughout the stay though, the staff were delightful and very polite.

The good reviews made us choose this hotel and the free airport transfers were a great plus, but we missed it by a few minutes when we arrived, so we took a maxicab for we could not wait an hour for the next one, we availed of the return trip though. Check in was fast and efficient. The staff were very helpful and took away the strain of travelling with two kids. The rooms were spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable enough for a good night's sleep after spending the day running after the kids. The hotel is a bit far from the city center and most attractions, and is not near any train station, but I still chose this hotel (and it was the best decision I made while planning our trip)  because they provided, in my opinion, 4 star amenities and 5 star service for less than what most central business district hotels cost, and the difference more than made up for the cost of 4 days of pure taxi travel, which by the way, you won't have any problem looking for in front of the hotel. (I did not relish the thought of commuting by train or bus with kids in tow and the time and energy it would waste). Drinking water was an issue though but there is a 7-11 behind the hotel where you can buy your supplies. If there was room for improvement, it would have to be the breakfast spread, though it was delicious, they had the same spread every morning the whole time we were there.

This hotel is ideal for an airport layover or short stay as its reasonably close to the airport and has a fantastic free private airport bus that will take you to and from the airport within 15-20 minutes. Many business travelers and airline crew stay here for this reason. The hotel is located about halfway between the airport and downtown Singapore. If you've ever spent any time in Singapore you will know that the traffic is horrendous (all the time) and getting a cab is difficult , so this is a big advantage if you want to be not far from the airport but also 15-30 minutes into town if you want a night out.

Well check-in was pretty much slow as the girl who assisted us was a trainee i presume as she was wearing ""I am learning"" badge on top of her name tag. So cant really blame that poor girl. After a long check in process, I finally check into a room. Much to my dismay, I found out that there are engineering personels in the room fixing the aircon. You cant be serious right?!?! Called down to the front office to have my room changed. It rang for so long until it got transferred to the operators. Dont the front office answer their phone?! However apart from that the operator I spoke too was quite lovely (Her name is Ida) She promised that she will get the room change done. I waited for 20mins and finally a bellman came up and assisted us with the room change. I was much amused by the fact that there was no apology call or even a call to inform about the room change. I guess Roxy lacks of personal touches. Cant expect much as mostly foreigners are working at the desk.

The new room was much better as it has the seaview. Breakfast was good and evening cocktail was ok. The drinks had to be ordered not self service and between the two ladies working at the royal club, they cant cope on such a high volume of orders. Waiting to be served was a chore. We ended up only having 2drinks.

Checkout was hell! Apparently they accidentally charged a wrong bill (which i did not consume) to my room. The front desk lady(annamie) was flustured and cant even take out the charge until she seek a help from her senior. After that was sorted out, she charged a wrong amount to my credit card!

family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Average hotel The front office was very pushy. We were told our room wasn't ready even though we arrived at 7pm while the check in time was 3pm. Then we were told we would have to wait an hour for the room to be ready. How ridiculous! Then we compromised that we would accept another room so that we could shower and take our dinner while we waited for the room we wanted to be ready. But no, they said that once i accepted a room, the room that we wanted needs to be released! Again, ridiculous. In the package that we took, it was said that we could be upgraded if there were rooms available. Instead they told us, the whole month, the rooms were fully booked, so no chance for upgrade. I get the notion here that i'm being taken for a ride. So I sternly told the front office that i was not pleased with the outcome now and asked the front office to speak to their manager to be sure if they are really intending to treat us this way. Fortunately, the manager saw our displeasure and provided the room which we wanted. Long story short, we have had to be stern with them to get what we wanted. What compounded our disappointment was that we had just procured the accor advantage plus card which wasnt cheap, only to be accorded this sort of service.

This hotel allows me to rent a car without worrying about high cost parking fee and early ERP as it is outside the zone. However the only downfall about this hotel is the rooms. It is slightly old and run down especially the cabinet. We were placed in a room at the end of the corridor past the fire escape door..the cabinet has one of those ""old"" smell. Also, the check-in/reception is always filled with people and not enough staff. So tend to wait longer than usual hotel.

,4.0,True,Positive,Good option for short stay I booked a day-use room at the mercure Roxy from 1.00pm-6.00pm because I was flying into Singapore at midday and flying back out at midnight. It was a good choice. There is a free shuttle bus from/to Changi airport that leaves every half hour. The room was a normal hotel room with all the amenities you would expect from a 4 star hotel.  if I was staying in Singapore any longer I would choose a hotel in the city centre as it is a $12.00 taxi trip to any of the usual sights.   The hotel is across the road from a large shopping centre which helps to fill in some time. I chose to extend my stay by 2 hours and they hotel did not charge me which I thought was very nice.

There is no free wifi, but you can use the computer in the lobby for free, for about 15 minutes per person.  There are 3 computers there.  There is a free shuttle to and from the airport.  Only problem we encountered was upon arriving at the airport, we were led to the this booth to look for the Grand Mercure shuttle, the girls at the desk were very rude and unaccommodating, just telling us they haven't seen the driver of Grand Mercure, so probably no shuttle.  So I had to get change for the phone and I called Grand Mercure asking them about the shuttle, and they told us to just wait where we were and they will send the driver right away.  I know the girls at the airport don't work for Grand Mercure, but maybe Grand Mercure should put their own staff to greet arriving guests, so the poor customer service of the airport employees won't reflect on their hotel.

The room was booked via the hotel's website which took about 5 minutes. However, I was a bit worrying about it since I didn't find a three-bed room option when booking the room, and therefore we reserved accodomation only for two of us. The problem was solved upon arrival, the smiling lady at the desk arranged an extra bed for the third person and handed over the key cards.

Room was clean, and had a panoramic view over Singapore Bay (14th floor) with large windows. Air conditioning was working quite well, it took only a few minutes to achieve optimal temperature. Bathroom also spotless, includes in-built hair-dryer.

Services at the hotel were well-arranged, daily newspaper was placed in front of the door every morning. If you make your way to the airport, you should take the Shuttle Bus option, which leaves every 30min. and is free of charge.

We had our breakfast outside the hotel, in the mall on the opposite side of the road. They have all sorts of kithcens, including local food restaurant, fast food and Polar cakes.

One more thing to mention is the location. After reading the previous reviews, I felt a bit nervous about the location of Grand Roxy, but finally, it turned out to be well-situated for tourists like us.

On our visit here it appeared that the bar staff were having words and were not being considerate to guests within the proximity who may have overheard, which we were not impressed with and none of the staff made any attempt to apologise either. On a plus note the pool is nice should you require some relaxation before a flight home.

After a rather drawn-out check in procedure, we had just enough time to pop into the Club Lounge to enjoy the complimentary hors d'oevres and ""cocktails"" (beer, wine, basic mixed drinks).  Our room was spacious, clean (stains on the carpet) and comfortable, and we had partially obscured views of the harbour.  The breakfast buffet in the Club room was very good, and with personal service and attention usually lacking at a buffet!    Our room was quiet, and we were also granted an extended checkout time of 3pm, which enabled us to take full advantage of its position across the road from a good-sized shopping mall and market, as well as the pool area.

,5.0,True,Positive,"Perfect Start If you want a perfect start to your holiday in Singapore or a wonderful stopover en route elsewhere, then the Roxy is a fantastic place to begin. Elegant rooms with one of the best buffet breakfasts on offer are two reasons why I would return to this hotel again and recommend it to all single (and couple) travellers alike.   Although a little expensive to my ideal price bracket, the Roxy's breakfast inclusion and free airport bus make it worthwhile spend. Located opposite a large shopping centre and market (to begin your Singapore shopover), you can catch the Number 36 bus for less than $AUS2 and find yourself near all the city sights (such as Orchid Road) and tourist areas within 10 minutes.

,3.0,True,Neutral,"Comfortable but impersonal We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 07. The room was clean and comfortable, with everything you would expect for this type of hotel. We had a view out to sea which was nice. Our main concern when we booked was the distance from Downtown Singapore, but this really isn't a problem as taxis are cheap and frequent buses run past the hotel to all over Singapore. There are also malls and restaurants near the hotel. The pool was really good for chilling out after a day shopping, sightseeing etc! We found the staff pleasant enough but no more than that, and the room did lack personality. But for a comfortable stopover in Singapore this is a good choice! ",2007-05-01,PreCovid,0
,5.0,True,Positive,"no problems We were using this as our overnight stay . Our check in was very efficient, room clean and large. Bed was so comfortable. We were travelling with a 4 year old and found the staff very child friendly. Breakfast was sensational, a huge selection. Over the road is a shopping centre and a market area which all the locals sit and have their dinner. We had a lovely evening meal there . The locals were all to willing to explain what the dishes were. We managed to have dinner for $10 and my partner managed a couple of dishes in that!!  We loved the pool area. We will definately stay here next time we go back to Singapore as despite the fact it is not central, taxi fares are so reasonable and the distances are not far to travel. ",2007-04-01,PreCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,Good hotel and near the airport A great hotel and much better than Accor's other hotel at Clarke Quay (Novotel).  The rooms were lovely with great views over the bay. Fairly nice swimming pool and good gym - can't comment on restaurants but they looked nice. Location is great for East Coast Park and very near airport.  Poor for central town.  Beware of Accor's Best Price Guarantee however - it's a complete joke - find your deal via Expedia etc and book that way. ,2007-05-01,PreCovid,0
couple,5.0,True,Positive,"A perfect stay We had a day and a half in Singapore en-route to New Zealand.  Our travel agent booked this hotel and initially I was a little disappointed it wasn't in central Singapore.  However, we had a wonderful stay.The hotel was a ten minute taxi ride from the airport - reasonable price and easily obtained taxi from the airport.  The immediate area was quiet and quite residential.  It was a five minute walk to a lovely beach and park, and the shopping centre with lots of shops and restaurants was just over the road.  We arrived mid-afternoon and went for a walk on the beach, walk round shopping centre, had a lovely Thai meal in one of the restaurants then back to the hotel for a drink.  In the morning we enjoyed an excellent breakfast then checked out of our large and well-appointed room, left our luggage and took a taxi to the MRT - the fast rail transport throughout the centre.  We managed Sentosa Island, Chinatown, high tea at Raffles and Orchard Road before getting a taxi back to the hotel to pick up our luggage and get us straight back to the airport.  Had we been staying for a few days a more central hotel would probably have been better but for our purposes it was ideal.",2007-03-01,PreCovid,0

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"quite different experience Stayed oct31 2006 on stopoverf & found this an excellent hotel. At airport went to visitors counter who arranged for a charming Malaysian to come & take us to hotel shuttle which was clean.Delightful 10 minute drive along beautiful East Coast Drive to hotel.Foyer was attractive, reception & other staff. very helpful,atmosphere relaxed. 9th floor room was spotless as was corridor.Attractive pool with gym & changing room.Attractive dining room with good breakfast (not expensive compared with CBD hotels). Over road a large 3 floor shopping complex with basement food hall.

Recommended as calm, relaxed & without rush ,bustle & crowds of central Singapore. Excellent attentive staff. Having read other critical reviews must say it was definitely not our experience & will certainly use again on stopover.",2006-11-01,PreCovid,0
family,4.0,True,Positive,OK Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights as it's close to Changi. Room is ok. Shuttle bus to airport was always nice. I would recommend this hotel to people catching red eye flights.,2006-02-01,PreCovid,0
family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Ok but needs refurb I stayed at the Mercure for 2 nights with my 10 yr old daughter (13-15th July). We booked through Qantas holidays and had free breakfast, 6pm checkout and shuttle service. We waited at the hotel bus pick up point at the airport for about 10 mins and were then ushered to the bus. Once inside the bus and on our way it became clear the airconditioning was not working at all. This was awful as it was 33 degrees C and humid and the windows didnt open. It is really a 15-20 min (not 10) trip to the hotel from the airport - thankfully not any longer in those conditions.

Check in was quick and we were given room 1430 (a deluxe room)! Nothing deluxe about this room. I had requested a non smoking room (my daughter is asthmatic so this was important). As soon as we stepped out of the elevator onto the 14th Fl, it was clear this floor was smoking - it stunk. Our room was even worse - it was right down the end of the corridor and it was musty/mouldy smelling. There were water stains on the curtains! The furniture and wall paper looked very shabby and the carpet was worn and old looking. I called down to the front desk and asked for another room - they said they were pretty full and would send up house keeping to ""refresh"" the room. This consisted of housekeeping spraying air freshener! So once the spray dissipated - the room stank again! I was not happy - we had flown from London over night and had not slept and just wanted to relax in our room. Another call to reception and they said they would get another room on the same floor for us. So I asked for the manager (Marianne) - who came up to the room. She agreed the room was not the best and said she would see what she could do.

Finally after 2 hours of mucking about - we were given a very nice room (1720) on the Royal Club floor which resembled the photos on the website. As a bonus for our inconvenience, Marianne organised access to the Royal Club lounge for us. This was excellent - complimentary breakfast, morning and afternoon tea and a cocktail hour with great finger food and free drinks from 6-8pm each night. The Club lounge overlooked the water and it was very nice and relaxing. If you are staying here, I would recommend getting the Royal Club rooms - you dont want to take the chance with the other rooms!

The pool was lovely (although very warm due to the hot weather). Unfortunately while we were there, there was a wedding on so the pool area was set up 2 days before with marquees and tables and chairs - a little inconvenient for guests. We could still swim but there were very few pool lounges available due to the wedding preparations.

The beds in our second room were lovely and soft with pillow top layers on them (the first room had rock hard beds)! The bathrooms are large and supply lots of amentities - creams, shampoos, nail file etc. Housekeeping were excellent - they never disturbed us and when we went out, our room was always clean by the time we came back. The breakfast was excellent also. Loads of food and huge variety of hot and cold items to choose from. However, you must get there early - they shut at 10.30 but start taking food away around 10.20am (We had jetlag so we were getting up late)!

Food in the restaurants was good but very pricey! There is a huge shopping mall across the road, so if you dont want to spend $7 on a juice or soft drink - go across the road - lots of different food outlets to choose from. Also this hotel is more geared to the business traveller - not so much to children. There are no children's menus etc.

This hotel is further out from the city but you can catch the no. 36 public bus into Suntec City (bus stop across the road from hotel) and do the Singapore Airlines Hop on Hop off bus - a good way to see Singapore.

I would probably stay closer to the city next time - it would not be worth the gamble on the rooms. We picked this hotel because it offered late checkout, free full breakfast and shuttle service - if you can get that somewhere else then I would go there!",2006-07-01,PreCovid,0

,2.0,True,Negative,"Give it a Miss Grand Roxy Mercure Singapore. I was told I would be met, not that there was a shuttle service every half hour.  I therefore spent 30 mins looking around for a sign with my name.Eventually I went to the hotel counter who rang and told me I had 25 mins. to wait.  Was met by an indifferent man and taken to a filthy bus.  On the way to the hotel he did a big hoick and opened the door and spat on the road.  it was all disgusting.  I was upgraded to a delxue room - nothing deluxe about it.  Admittedly it was a good size, but it was shabby and not too clean.  I usually stay at the Changhi Meridian and will go back there next time.The free glass of wine is given begrudginly in a very dubious looking bar by the pool. I will not be staying at this hotel again.  It is worth the extra 10 mins to go to a City Hotel.",,,0
,2.0,True,Negative,"Never a 4 star Our booking was for 2 'Superior' rooms but if what we were given were truly superior I would hate to see the standard rooms.
Our rooms were shabby, tired and had been badly serviced. There was only one sachet of coffee in the room and it is the first time I have ever stayed in a hotel of any category where half-used bottles of shampoo etc were provided. The air conditioning was noisy and not up to the task imposed by the heat and humidity of Singapore.
Although billed as 'convenient' for the airport it is still a fairly long ride away so next time I will stay in one of the much better city hotels even if just for a stopover.",2006-01-01,PreCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"Mecure Roxy - Great place to lay your head The Roxy is half way between the ""city"" and airport - about 10 min to Orchard Rd via cab or bus.  Great hotel.  Clean rooms, quiet, spacious.  Lovely pool and functional gym to wipe away the jet lag.Across the road is Roxy Square shopping centre with everything you need - supermarket, food court and a whole raft of retail shops.  Note they don't usually open until 11am.  Starbucks opens from 7am.We stayed in a double room, all look onto the pool - don't expect views.  Bathroom was great, including a bath/shower that was ideal for a soak.  Food in the hotel was good.  Thai restaurant was great - expensive wine.Close to East Coast Park where you can hire bikes (shop around on price and time of hire) for a quick exercise or day travelling around.  If you are game you can ride into the city etc.  Would recommend to any traveller passing through Singapore.",,,0
business,2.0,True,Negative,"Gone down hill I think I have stayed at this hotel 3 times in the past.  On each occasion I have selected it since it is close to the airport and I have a follow on flight the next morning.  In the past I have been very pleased with the place.  It is convenient, there is a shuttle bus from the airport (although it has limited timing i.e. it does not run at night and the first morning bus is 7am) This last stay was much worse than before.  I was assigned a room on the 9th floor which looked very worn and shabby.  There was no high speed internet to be found.  When I woke up at 4:30 am in perperation for my 7:15 flight I found that the shower head in the bath was broken.  The shower head was hanging down on the cord and could not be clipped up.  This was just another sign of how the management and general condition of this hotel has deteriated over the past few years.Lastly, since the shuttle did not start until 7am, the hotel booked me a 5:15am taxi.  They booked a mercedes limo with a fixed fee of 25SGD to take me the 10 minute trip to the airport.Next time I'm quickly passing through Singapore, I'll definetly give this place a miss and spend an extra 10 mins going to a decent hotel in the city.  Its a real shame that this place has gone down hill so much.",2005-12-01,PreCovid,0
,5.0,True,Positive,"Excellent Hotel in Singapore This hotel is in between the airport and the city, about $15 by taxi but there is a free shuttle bus every 30 minutes if you let them know you are coming. This hotel is excellent value for money and an extensive breakfast is included. There is a pool and gym for guests to use, and many shops around the area including some in the hotel building. A big Mall linked by a walkway over the road from the hotel. I recommend the Chinese massage inside the hotel building, certainly revived my travel worn body after a fifteen and a half hour flight!!

The rooms were spacious and well appointed and very clean. Both our ""non-smoking"" rooms smelled smoky and changing rooms was no problem.
I wish smokers would have a little more consideration, especially when most hotels have especially allocated ""smoking"" rooms.

Towels are provided at the pool and you can have drinks or dinner at the bar beside the pool. Great pool-side barbeque available too, yummy! There was no internet access in our ""superior"" room, although the ""deluxe"" rooms had wireless access. We were able to use the hotel's ""business centre"" computer for $18 per hour. There is also a coin operated guest laundry which was greatly appreciated! (Pity more hotels don't offer this facility instead of over priced in house services.)

We were able to stay in the hotel until 6pm on the day we left at no extra charge.

This was our last hotel before heading home to Australia after a five week holiday and countless hotels. It was a fitting end to a wonderful holiday and one of the best hotels we experienced all over the world. We wished we could've stayed longer than two nights!

Highly recommended!",,,0
,5.0,True,Positive,"Comfortable place to stay near the airport. This hotel is handy to the airport and has a hotel shuttle (free).  You just need  to go to the airport visitor information area and ask about it and they'll come and pick you up.  It's 10 minutes' drive from the terminal.Having stayed previously closer to the town on the river, we thought we'd try this hotel and were not disappointed although if you want to go in to the city, you need to catch a bus nearby.  The beach is a short walk away and is lovely and quiet.  The shops seem to be mainly for the locals and we did not see any bargains here.  Buffet breakfast was $S36 each - more than adequate and most delicious.  Having stayed often in Accor's hotels, we have always been happy with them as we were with this one.There are cheaper hotels in Singapore but,  like us, if you just need to be handy to the airport and in a very spacious, comfortable hotel (with a bath), this could be for you.  The rack rate here is $S240 per room per night but you may get a better deal on the Net.",,,0
,2.0,True,Negative,"Disappointed with staff and breakfast We stayed in 4 hotels in Singapore and Malaysia, all with 4 to 5 star ratings. All hotels except the Roxy had helpful enthuaistic staff and good food. All I can say about the Roxy was it was clean and handy to the airport. I waited for 20 mins to checkin and Reception was well staffed and not very busy. I was told a load of rubbish about problems with the room safe. For breakfast we were seated at a dirty table that was still in use by other guests (other guests were getting more breakfast). I asked for French Toast and was told unavailble except for special order to the Chef at additional cost ( all other hotels provided French Toast in Breakfast Buffet) Fruit juice glass had very sharp broken and chipped rim.

,5.0,True,Positive,"Excellent value close to the airport We stayed at the Grand Mercure Roxy Park (as it's now called) for two nights in September 2004 and then again for one night in October.  We wanted a comfortable transit hotel to break the journey, with our two-year old, between New Zealand and Belgium.  The hotel is only a 10 minute shuttle drive from the airport (free shuttle!), has excellent facilities, is close to fantastic hawking areas for tasty laksas, and right across from the Parkway shopping mall, in walking distance from the East Coast Park.  Child-friendly (play room, kiddie pool), friendly staff, affordable room service, very spacious rooms, satisfactory pool area, an immaculate  guest self  service laundry (always keeping in mind that we're travelling with a two year old) -- transit heaven!  We will definitely stay there again.  Please note that this may not be what you're looking for if you want the Orchard shopping experience, but for exhausted parents, en route half way the globe, it was a perfect place.",,,0
