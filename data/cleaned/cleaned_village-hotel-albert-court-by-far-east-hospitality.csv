The wifi is disgraceful as it continuously disconnects while you are using it even after contacting their “IT department”. Also there is an establishment near the area that has singing (awfully) at night which can be heard from the rooms, goes on too long and is not pleasant to listen to.

I was extremely lucky to have met Mr Donal who took the extra effort in searching for a spare keyboard for me to use. Truly remarkable and goes beyond my wildest expectations, saving me an unnecessary trip home / having to drop by sim lim square for a completely unnecessary new keyboard. Needless to say, i am extremely satisfied with the services rendered at this hotel and will find myself coming back in future.

,2.0,True,Negative,"Not recommended Location:
If you are a vegetarian or enjoy Indian cuisine, you may find it convenient to book a hotel near the Little India market. However, if you prefer other types of food, it may be more cost-effective to book a hotel near Santosa to avoid daily commute expenses.

Room:
We found that the standard rooms were more comfortable than the premier rooms, so we decided to downgrade our booking(in the same cost). The premier rooms are located in a separate building and lack a pleasant ambiance. Additionally, we were informed that room service is currently unavailable due to limited staffing

Cost:
The cost charged by the hotel does not justify the lack of room service and the subpar quality of their food. Additionally, we were disappointed to learn that they charge an extra fee of $23 per hour for early check-in.

Food:
I suggest not to include dinner in your booking as the breakfast provided had limited options and was below average in taste.

Staff:
- Only the best thing at there

Breakfast spread was ok, not great. One plus was that we request for gluten free bread, which they happily provided. Jason at the reception was extremely rude over the phone and even when I went to talk to him at the reception. I called from my room to ask for some bowl and spoons, he said I will have to come down to the reception to take it or wait for 30 mins as they were short on staff. I strongly feel a hotel runs with good attitude and warmth . This place is lacking that. House keeping was very good.
In the end you can get better places to stay in at this price.",2020-01-01,PreCovid,0

Very near to Little India underground station which can be used to get around the city easily.   The hotel, in places, is tired and, in the rooms we stayed in, could do with a refurbishment. Nothing major but plaster/paint peeling off the walls, stains in bathroom etc. We had to move rooms during our stay due to our room being adjacent to a very busy road. The windows were single glazed and so we struggled to get to sleep. Top tip - if you’re visiting this hotel ask for a room over the courtyard and on a higher floor, we found this much quieter.

However, this particular property requires an immediate upgrade and also a different approach from the management.  1) They do renovations while having staying in house. Good properties close a wing for refurbishment then open once all works completed. In Village hotel guests see empty fountains, lifts under renovation and it’s constant.   2) The 2nd wing rooms are disaster. My washbasin was clogged so I had to decide not to shave, it was filling up to the top very fast. There was also water on a floor coming from somewhere (I didn’t use shower all day and there was water). The building has aircon machines on its roof creating noise and vibration in upstairs rooms.

,3.0,True,Neutral,"Decent Hotel and Good Location We stayed for 5Ds/4Ns at Village Hotel Albert Court. Property is located close to Little India. We finalized this hotel based on the reviews and ratings.
What we liked
- Location (10mins walking distance to Mustafa, A2B and Komala Vilas, Khansama Tandoori and Pakistani Restaurants, 1-2 min walking distance to 7Eleven Shop and Little India MRT and Rocher MRT, 4-5 mins walking distance to SIM LIM Square).
- Staffs were friendly and courteous. Siva was our guest service incharge while checking in
- American Buffet Breakfast (they serve few Indian food like Vada, Idly, Rava Upma). Vegetarians will like this place, for eggetarian and meat eaters it is only eggs and sausages)
- Just outside the hotel you will find Italian, Indian restaurants and few beer joints.
What we did not like
- We stayed in Room# 211 (corner and odd dimensional room). We requested for change and they denied our request. (Do NOT go by the pictures of the room, the rooms are very small)
- Just below our room, there is a club which plays music till 11pm and the room acoustics are soo bad, one could hear the sound inside the room.
- Wifi Internet works intermittent and no range in our room. Every 24hours one got to login the credentials.

,4.0,True,Positive,"Pleasant Stay, Courteous & Helpful Staff, Very Good Location We booked 2 rooms here from 16th August to 21st August 2019. Check-in was normal, Jana was at the desk and helped us with the room keys. Our luggage was brought to the rooms by the staff. Rooms on the 6th Floor are worth it, for the view and for being quiet. They brought in the extra bed, as requested for 1 room. The other room was not ready at that time, but was available in the next 10 minutes.

Went into the second room and were suprised to see a queen bed in there. It was way too small for us to accomodate. Went in back on the reception and requested Jana. She understood our plea as we were with a child and offered us the king room adjacent to our first one, but from the next day. This came in as a respite. We somehow managed the first night. Second day, our room was shifted to the bigger one and we were more than happy.

Beds were good, matresses were very comfortable and were good for our backs. Cleaniness was at par. The toiletries could have been a lot better though. You can add a separate hair conditioner bottle to it. The lifts need an upgrade. The card readers are not upto the mark and most of the times we had to swipe them about 10 times to get it to work. The door closing action is sluggish. I am sure you will have something planned for it already as the permit expires on 30th September 2019.

Tap water is safe to drink, however, the glasses provided inside the washroom are too small and can be mistaken for denture glasses. I had to double check with the reception. Tea and coffee trays are fine. In the hot and humid weather, one would expect cold water to be available in the room. But you have toe either buy the bottles form them, or fill up the bottles from tap and keep them in refrigerator for hours to get them cold.

Breakfast spread is very good. The breakfast lobby is a bit small, but arrangement of buffets is great considering the space they have. Quality of food is very very good. The staff is courteous, takes requests and helps you. Fresh fruit and salad counters are the best part.

Hotel is a stone throw distance away from Bugis, Little India, Sim Lim Square, Rochor MRT and you can go anywhere from here easily. They have cafe's right at the entrance, a microbrewery, indian food resturant, all of them with happy hours. Orchard road is about 2 kms walk from here.

A special mention for Jocelyn, she was very helpful to us and went the extra mile to get us a taxi quickly when our transfer guy did not turn up at the hotel. She even helped change our rooms and did everything with a big smile. Big thumbs up to her.

Checkout was good too. They safeguarded our luggage for hours. Siva is a great and helpful guy at the frontdesk.

All in all, it's a very good hotel to stay at. Albeit the rooms are renovated, this being a colonial architecutre hotel, feels a bit dated. I am sure, this can be taken care of in the time to come.

Good internet
Great location near Little India, easy to get to MRT, lots of food options nearby
Friendly staff
Shop-front hotel exterior is picturesque
Good A/C

Cons:
While the room was generally clean, there were some maintenance issues. For example, the moulding around one of the windows had been eaten by insects. I did not see any insects while I was there, but clearly, it had been a problem for some time. It's impossible that house keeping did not notice. Also, the drapes were shredded. There were long (>1ft) vertical holes in the drapes. When you tried to close the drapes, they would just rip more. I was considering asking to be moved to a different room, but, from the exterior of the hotel (the hi-rise portion of the hotel needs a good power-washing), I was not particularly confident that any other room would be any better.

The rooms in the shop-front portion of the hotel can be noisy. My room was directly above a restaurant, so you could hear patrons and music. The a/c provided a good white-noise background that helped to drown-out the sound. I was so exhausted that it didn't make a difference to me, but if you are a light sleeper, it would probably be a problem.

After I repeatedly asked where my second child would sleep they reluctantly wheeled in another single bed. The room was grotty and dated and stank like someone had spilled bleach on the floor. The lights by the bed were bent and nearly electrocuted my husband when we went to find the switch to turn it off... instead he blew a fuse. No apology when we informed reception. To turn out the lights you have to take the card out of the wall ... leaving no active light switch in the bathroom (or anywhere) if you need to use it during the night. Not ideal with children.

friends,5.0,True,Positive,"Relaxing & Memorable Staycation Experience Firstly, I had stayed at this hotel from 15 to 16 June 2019 and booked my hotel room through the official hotel website which allows me to enjoy special member rates which are lower than those rates being offered at other booking websites.

Secondly, the staff member who had helped me with checking into my hotel room is very professional and friendly. He had kindly given me a free room upgrade from a superior room to a club room which is an extremely pleasant surprise for me. When another guest had shamelessly tried to cut into my queue, he had also kindly advised him to join in the queue behind me instead. As such, the check in process for me was fast and seamless without any precious time being wasted.

Lastly, the hotel room which I had stayed in was specklessly clean and tidy and the bed was also very soft and comfortable to sleep in until I had spent most of my time in my hotel room. Everything from both the iron and ironing board especially for business travellers to the hair dryer and safe were being provided during my stay there. As such, I was able to pack light for my staycation and didn't have to worry about not having my necessities around with me.

The bathroom is adequate but dated and most annoyingly we couldn’t find any light switches. This meant removing the key card from the master switch when we needed to sleep. Not ideal for finding the bathroom in the night. There is also a lack of suitably placed sockets for charging smart phones.

family,5.0,True,Positive,Perfect Location with English Style.. Hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable. Two wings of hotel on opposite side. Had a chance to stay on side opposite to main building. Perfect stay. Very clean rooms. Artifacts and ambience was royal. Check in was hassle free and quick. The best thing is that they provide HANDY phone in each room. With it you get unlimited data to google..call taxis..and even call INDIA & few other countries for free and roam around Singapore with its help. The only thing is you have to keep it safe during your stay. Location wise walking distance to Tekka Centre where Indians will love Chicken Biryani. Just cross the road and you are in Little India where you get good Indian food. If you walk to other side you come to Bugis Street where lot of street shopping can be done. Overall worth staying at Albert Court. People say hotel rooms in Singapore are small..but here you get perfect sized rooms..peace and tranquility.,2018-06-01,PreCovid,0

,4.0,True,Positive,"Delightful, Friendly and even Magical! The Village Hotel in Little India is quite deceiving from the front - it looks like a collection of shop houses but in fact there are eight levels behind. We travelled as two couples and our rooms were on the fifth floor. They were very clean and spacious - we even had a bench for our two suitcases to sit side by side, with enough room left for a seat. With a safe, hair dryer, robes and slippers we were well provided for, our only complaint was lack of light for make-up/shaving in the bathroom, but this seems to be the case in most hotels, and we had some traffic noise in the mornings but not enough to worry us. There is a gym and spa but no pool and the Albert Restaurant is available in the hotel for breakfast and dinner. On our only night of dining there we were disappointed as they substituted the chicken in our char kway teow with tasteless cubes of something like a chicken loaf, but the little bar in the lobby is cosy and their Singapore Slings are the best I have tasted in my long years of visiting the country. No premix here. There are many restaurants surrounding the hotel and it is a ten minute walk in a straight line to the Intercontinental Hotel area with its shops and restaurants. That is if you don't stop to check out the many stalls and little shops along the way. This is a delightful small hotel with friendly, efficient staff, one of whom will even entertain you with great little magic tricks while you enjoy a drink.

In spite of so much rush both were personally attending to each guest tirelessly and with ever smiling face. Such staff is an asset to any Hospitality industry. Not to forget that the food was very tasty and menu was changing everyday. Even the 2 waitresses were also doing very good job.,2018-05-01,PreCovid,0

family,3.0,True,Neutral,Ok 3 star not a 4 star! We arrived very early on the 2nd January. Exhausted with 2 children and jet lagged we asked to check in early to rest. This was unfortunately not possible. We offered to pay extra and the staff kindly then offered a room on ground floor. When we entered the room We got the baby cot as asked. As I was about to lay our baby I noticed pubic hair in her cot! Outraged I went through the rest of the room. The bathroom was not clean and there was hair on the floor (clearly not cleaned) and the bathtub (I took a look) there was an insect and hair too. I directly went to front desk to complain. The staff quickly cleaned the room and we got our rest. Unfortunately their mistake stayed in my mind rest of the week. When our family room was ready we moved in there. The family room was big which was a plus. Relatively clean and very quiet even though heavy traffic outside. The breakfast was of Ok standard the omelette chef was appreciated. The hotel tries to boast of four star but is wear down a bit and you see that they are just not a four star.

I kept getting an  upset stomach.   If i knew this place was so old fashion and no great service i would have definately looked at other hotels!   The only good thing about the hotel was location. It was near little india and could walk to orchard road.   Singapore is a very expensive country. Just for a mars bar it cost $2!? In the UK it's only like 50 pence!

family,2.0,True,Negative,"Dirty furniture and dirty chef's uniform Paid s$50/ night extra for a club family room for 3 adults.. Was offered a room on the ground floor of the annex. This had a king bed only with an old, stained, small sofa. Was informed that a roll in single bed would also be provided and this was rolled in. This was ancient and totally unsuitable for an adult. Not what we had requested.

We complained and were told by Mr Syed Ali Bin Syed that this club room was bigger than a family room (not true) and that no other rooms were available. Shortly after, a room on the first floor of the annex became available and we accepted it.

Furniture old, bathroom showing it's age. This hotel is acceptable but definitely not a 4 star hotel.

Breakfast was forgettable. Poor choice and crowded. No tea bags available. Tea made in a pot sitting in a hot plate. Presumably to save on tea bags. Shocked to see a chef with a filthy, stained uniform. Club members are offered a continental breakfast with even less choice in the annex presumably to lessen the crowding.

We enquired about a late check out and were told by Mr Syed that hotel was full and that check out would be 1pm at the latest. After checking our booking we noticed that club members were allowed check out at 4pm. Pointed this out to reception and was told that we only had a complimentary upgrade! Not true. They took the money for our upgrade from us immediately at check in.

This is a decent hotel which is now showing it's age. Not helped by indifferent attitude of management and cost cutting. We never got the feeling that customer care and satisfaction was the top priority at this hotel. Don't accept information given to you by management.",2017-08-01,PreCovid,0

There is a huge breakfast every morning including Indian and western food, fresh fruit, tea, coffee and juices. The rooms are a decent size with plenty of space to unpack and work. Wifi connection was great - never had a problem. Staff were also happy to print. There is a 24 hour gym but I didn't use it.   The only feedback I'd give to the hotel is that the towels don't need to be changed every day, and not to waste shower caps, shampoos etc. This attitude seemed to be the same all over Singapore - a lot of waste and not much recycling.

In the club building there was a tea and coffee machine available 24 hours as well as a coffee machine in the room.  In the main hotel, the gym and jacuzzi areas were great; however, we didn't have time to use them as we were busy exploring the city!  Below our room was a little noisy as the hotel is part of a square with a few small bars and restaurants. The noise wasn't too excessive though and did not disturb us.

I enjoyed the breakfast that was included with my room each morning, and found the staff exceptionally good at taking care of me. The cleaning staff did a wonderful job on my room, and because it was ""club"" room, across the courtyard from the check-in, it was large and spacious. My only complaint is the bed: though it was very large, it was the hardest mattress I've ever encountered in a hotel bed, and you could feel the springs through the padding quite noticeably. Time to get new mattresses, I think! I certainly appreciated the 2 free water bottles each day.   ",2017-08-01,PreCovid,0

It took 25 minutes after checkin time to get a room and even then it was only after I went and asked again. They then explained it was because of my request for twin beds. A request I didn't make and that I'd already clarified twice before.   At no point did they even offer a glass of water, they just stuck us on a couch and ignored us.   It then took another 25 minutes for the bags to come up and again, only after I called and asked what was happening.

As the rest of the bed lines made a very clean impression I did not complain, but was sure the next day when they service the room the sheet will be exchanged. This did not happen. Only after the second night the sheet was exchanged.
Overall the hotel is ok and I would stay there again, but if I would pay my own money (I was on a business trip and had not much choice) I would look for a different hotel.
The windows are very thin and so you could hear the traffic noise very loud. The hotel is very conveniently located just steps away from MRT and bus station. There is no pool in the hotel.
It would have been nice to have a changing room for the day of departure, as the flights to Germany leave late in the night and it would be great to have a convenient place to change from the day dress to the flight clothes.

On the doorstep of the hotel you will find the Little India and Arab Street districts which can easily be explored on foot lots of good inexpensive restaurants and shops. All the staff we had dealings with were friendly and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them. Our room was number 618 was located on the courtyard side of the hotel very quiet it was comfortable and  spotless  all the mod cons were provided even fresh bottled water provided free daily.

,5.0,True,Positive,Second Great Stay Having had such a great stay on our way over to Australia in February we decided to book on our way back home. The second visit we upgraded to a Club Room which was really good value (unfortunately this on the way out was a package and unaware that they had Club Rooms). Excellent value with breakfast included and complimentary bar for a set period of time in the evening. The hotel staff were extremely obliging and the rooms on both occasions were clean and comfortable. The Club Room also had a phone which could be used for free calls to certain countries including USA and UK.  The hotel is very well situated for the MRT and we will be staying again next year ,2017-03-01,PreCovid,0

,5.0,True,Positive,"Great Location, Good Colonial Property We chose to stay at  Village, Albert Court on a recommendation by a friend who lives in Singapore. The biggest advantage staying here was the location. Located in the centre of the city, it has access to two metro stations within 5 minutes walk, and proximity to Little India, where we had access to Indian food.  Even for shopping, its walking distance from Bugis, and bus/metro away from major shopping and tourist attractions in Singapore.  We also stayed in a more expensive business hotel for a couple of days initially before shifting to Village, and we found this property very homely, with colonial style building and friendly staff.

The Rochor MRT stop on the new Blue Downtown Line is a 3 minute walk to give you a location idea.  It ticks all the boxes for a clean & comfy room in expensive central Singapore with all the room amenities you would expect to pay a lot more for. Having said that, I did not like the location of my room on the 2nd floor with one window blocked totally by the kitchen roof & the other barely allowing daylight in from Albert Street.

We informed the front desk and they promptly changed us to a room on the fourth floor, which was better. Both rooms were quite spacey for Singapore, clean and bright.

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Wonderful service! I stayed for one month at Albert Court from mid Jan to mid Feb 2017 as an older woman traveling alone for business/research. After some issues with my first room the manager found a perfect room for me in an inner courtyard facing a garden. He and his staff did everything possible and more to insure my comfort and ability to work. The head of housekeeping changed the chair in my room to fit my needs; an additional fluffy pad was added to make my bed more comfortable. My room clearer did a fine job of keeping things tidy. The breakfast bar offered made-to-order eggs and accommodated my lower sodium needs as did the waitstaff who searched to make sure I had salt-free butter.
The hotel is perfect for getting things done—well located with a driveway for easy access to taxis—all know the hotel.

We stayed for 5 nights and there was hardly an interaction with any of the staff. Being a GM of an international Attraction myself, I would be concerned on the dullness or lack of pro activeness of the staff in interacting with their customers. With the dull treatment i received, I would say, I booked an overly expensive property here. One unpleasant incident was that we were sitting in lobby and the staff closed lights of the lobby.

family,4.0,True,Positive,"A good place to stay in! Stayed here for 2 nights last week of December 2016 with extended family. Hotel is compact and comfortable. The rooms, though very clean, seem a little bare and empty, probably because of the high ceiling. And some of the rooms have very small windows. So not much in terms of outside views. Bedding was very good and comfortable. Linens clean. Bathrooms clean and equipped with basic toiletries. The bathtub in one of our rooms looked old and stained and the water was not draining properly (had to pull out the drain plug to let the water drain fully). No issues otherwise.

Service was excellent. Any requests were handled promptly. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a tour desk too where they can help out with any sightseeing queries. You can buy tickets to the attractions directly there itself, without having to wait in the queue at the venue. Very helpful and time saving!

Buffet Breakfast was good with a nice range of choices, including an omelette station. The dining area is a bit crowded though. It was difficult to get a place to sit in the ""peak"" hours and had to wait for a table both the mornings.

Location wise, it is about 20 minutes from Changi and costs about 20 to 25 SGD to reach. Little India is a 5 minute walk. A few restaurants are right outside the hotel in Village Square. And a couple more just around the corner of the street. If looking for South Indian food, Ananda Bhavan in Little India is just a short 5 to 10 minute walk.

Though we did not take MRT from the hotel, Rochor subway station seems to be very close. Little India station is a little farther away than Rochor, but both within a short walk. If you have not traveled by Singapore MRT, it is the best way to get around the city. Fast and efficient and close to most of the attractions.

As this was my first hotel stay in Singapore, I don't know if the services and facilities are at par with other hotels here in the same price range, but it is definitely a nice play to stay with good facilities and service. And in a good location.",2016-12-01,PreCovid,0

We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am with a 2 pm check-in.  They allowed us to check with a $45 CAD fee.  It was worth it to us as we had been travelling for two days (fly in from Toronto) and we were very tired.Twin beds are very comfortable with 4 star linens (feather duvets).  Hotel room had a refrigerator and safe.  Hotel is conveniently located between MRT stations little India and Rochor.  We used the MRT to get to the hotel and it was very easy to do this.The staff helped me make sure that I got picked up by Tour East for the Night Safari when I realized that I had not confirmed and my phone was not working.We did not go with the breakfast package so I can't comment on that.

family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Good Location... Poor Service The location of Hotel is good (near Little India and Bugis). The check in was fast, however the hotel lacks the hospitality. The room service is very very slow.

1. Day 1 : the room we checked in was very small. We had requested for a King bed as we were travelling with a kid. We ended up getting a room with a queen bed as the hotel informed that they dont have King beds...

OK... We requested for an extra bed, obviously on payment basis... We had to follow up 2-3 times over 3-4 hours, after which we were informed that Extra bed cant fit in our room. We were finally offered a room where in the extra bed can fit but were informed that extra bed is only available for 2 days in our 3 day stay! We had no choice but to agree!

2. Day 2: we left in the morning around 10 AM and requested for the room to be cleaned. At about 3 Pm when we returned, the room was not cleaned yet! We ordered Sandwiches from the restaurant and the guy initially refused saying ""You have not given deposit"" ... Agreed i had not given deposit, but nobody had even asked me nor had i refused payment! Makes me wonder of the service orientation... Finally when the sandwich was delivered , a 9$ sandwich costed me 15$ ($6 service charge!!!!!)

3. Day3: Again getting the room cleaned meant 2-3 follow ups and then an escalation to the reception!

Dont recommend the hotel for the cost that it charges...",2016-12-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel is in a great location, just 5 min walk from Rochor MRT Station and the Little India quarter. The staff here are excellent (well groomed, polite, very attentive and helpful). The site itself is clean, tidy and well presented. There are a number of restaurants adjacent to the hotel and the Hospoda Czech Microbrewery which serves wonderful icy cold beer (a Godsend after wandering Singapore in the heat and humidity all day).

The hotel itself has a bar and a restaurant, however I chose to eat and drink at hawker centres and bars elsewhere. I did have breakfast at the hotel one morning and found it disappointing for the price.

My room was clean, well appointed and reasonably quiet. Two small bottles of water were provided each day when the room was serviced.

On the down side... the room was extremely small for the tariff paid (in comparison to other places I have stayed both in Singapore and around the world, and in comparison to the photos on the hotels website). The refrigerator in the room was nothing short of useless and the air-conditioning was always freezing (despite what temperature I set it at). The water pressure in the shower was poor and the mixer tap contrary. One day I decided to take a nice hot relaxing bath and it took the best part of an hour to run enough water to 2/3 fill the bath.

As I was travelling solo and spending most of my time out and about I accepted that the room was adequate for my needs, despite my disappointment in relation to value for money paid.

The rooms are comfortable and clean, with a bath and free fast wifi.  This time I booked direct which was a mistake as taxes are added at the final stage of booking, so it will probably be cheaper to book via a hotel portal.  Check when booking if breakfast is included, as it is reasonable value.    The best place to eat is the Tekka Centre under the Apartment Block diagonally across the junction.

Had some great food joints just outside the hotel as well. Overall very pleasant experience. Though I wish there was a comfortable waiting / changing room. In my case my flight was at 10:45 pm and to avoid being charged for an extra day I had to check out at 12 noon. I understand that from business point of view. But if they had a closed ante room or lounge it would be great to wait while waiting to depart. I went out sightseeing to kill a few hours but due to Singapore's humidity came back fully drenched in sweat. Hence a a shower facility even if charged at a nominal rate would be a great add on for travellers. That is just my constructive feedback.,2016-08-01,PreCovid,0

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Interesting location right near Little India! We enjoyed our stay at the Village Hotel. Stayed over 6 nights, including the Formula One weekend in September.
Our first trip to Singapore for the purpose of seeing the GP. Weren't too keen on staying on the Marina or near Orchard Road. Not really our scene. Prefer something a bit more 'local' in its atmosphere. We weren't let down. Easy to get to other parts of the city (only 5 mins walk to Little India station) and will probably be even easier when they finish the new subway connections next to the hotel.
Room was big enough for 6 nights. Not exactly enormous, but then we didn't order a huge suite or anything.
Breakfast was fine. Got a bit repetitive after 6 nights and we ended up going out for breakfast in Little India a couple of days (Kopi, kaya toast and soft boiled eggs, do it!)
We liked being able to walk about Little India, lots of great people watching and excellent places to eat there. Arab St is a walkable distance too, as is Bugis and the National Gallery/Bras Basah area (unless you get really hot, really quickly, then use the subway/taxi).
Albert St also has a big hawkers down the road and its own little Chinatown.
Location was fab!
The hotel itself was fine. I mean, hotels don't usually wow me. We prefer smaller B&Bs and AirBNB usually.

family,1.0,True,Negative,"Never stay in this hotel I had stayed in this hotel from 6th May till 12th May 15. To ensure I get what I need; I have done booking directly on their website and booked a family room with three separate beds and also got the confirmation from them. I was really enthused when I received a mail from the hotel manger that he will be responsible to make my stay comfortable. He asked me for room location preference, food requirements, arrival time etc. Subsequent to that I requested for a room on ""higher floor with good view"".
However nothing has gone right from the moment, I stepped in this hotel. I was travelling with my old mother and wife but nobody even bothered to help us with our luggage to lobby and then room. While checking in lady at front desk refused me the room which I had booked i.e. room with three separate beds as it was already given to someone. I could even see her changing already allotted room number on my record sheet. When I tried to reason out with my reservation details, she told that rooms are allotted based on availability and you are late. In such case, it does not make any sense to pay & reserve room in advance. Even it was a great joke to ask for room location preference, arrival time-flight details etc. The room was a big disappointment. It was dark and gloomy place on ground floor (Room 101) with absolutely no view. The room cleanliness was horrible especially washroom. I could see uncleaned toilet floor. Sofa in the room was absolutely worth replacing. Remote control of the TV was not working though we hardly watched any channels. This hotel is not worth of money being spent. Complementary breakfast menu for all 5 days of our stay was more or less same with very limited options.
When I complained over mail to manager regarding room allocation, he tried to pacify me with a drink but we could not meet due to mismatch of our schedules and no special efforts from him.
My room was also not cleaned properly during my stay which we could easily make out. Finally I decided to ignore as it was taking toll on my holiday. We spent most our time outside and used the room only to sleep in the night. Especially my wife was very upset with the responses from your staff and cleanliness of the room. I had stayed in other parts of the world but never experience such low quality of service. They are least cared about the customer experience and probably never want repeat customer.

To be frank, I did not have much expectations with the hotel when I started from India but I got to the hotel's courtyard, I was pleasantly surprised. It is beautiful, like most parts of the city are. Reception placement, in house restaurant and accessibility to rooms is not the hotel's forte though but the efficient staff makes us for it completely.  The hotel is half a klick away from Little India and so you can easily walk your way to familiarity and food. Also, it has an Indian restaurant right below the hotel which serves food better than even some restaurants in India.  Also has a seven eleven store almost next to it.The best part about the hotel was (surprisingly!) the travel desk, which is outsourced by the way. If you are there for tourism, you would want to use it to plan your visits because A. It is reliable and B. It is unlike other overpriced travel desks. I took three of its tours and it was economical and we even got some perks like a complimentary dinner, skipping lines at the Night Safari etc. A three star hotel which can very well be a four star depending on how you see it.

The front desk staff is very friendly and always eager to help.

Room looked good at the first go but the secret was that some construction was going on and the noises were terrible. I had unpacked most of the things and then called up the reception for this trouble. They explained that the other room will be available after 2pm on the ground floor.

My second stay was much more comfortable in every aspect. Staying at the Village Hotel Albert Court could not have been better. Admittedly it's a little out of the way, but after four nights that was my only minor gripe. The staff could not be more accommodating and nothing was too much trouble such as umbrellas without signing your life away, a 12 noon check-out, access to shower facilities on the final day and smiling staff to help with your every need. The hotel was clean, comfortable and very reasonably priced.

I reached the hotel around 9:30 a.m. however, their check-in time is 2:00 p.m. so I was asked to wait at the lobby.After the travel, the kids were getting very restless but thankfully the front desk got us the room by 11:30 a.m.
the room itself was pretty good in size. we had an extra bed place in the room and even then there was space.

There are a cluster of cafes in the ground floor of the hotel which open into a courtyard. it really lights up in the evening and sets a festive atmosphere there. that was a good surprise. The location of the hotel is very good. it is equidistant from Little India and Bugis - 5 min walk with kids. You may have to walk 5-10 min to get to Little India or Bugis MRT stations. If you want to get a taxi then the options are to book from the hotel (they charge few $) or walk up to the road and wait for one to come along.
there are a couple of 7-11 stores in the vicinity for your mundane daily needs.

The staff is professional and courteous. I called the housekeeping a couple of times for setting up the extra bed and for out of turn cleaning and got good response.
My breakfast was included in the stay. The spread was limited and a little blandish. I have seen better breakfast spreads in most hotels. It was not less but not lavish either. It did its job. If you are very picky and choosy on what you eat then you may want to check with them before booking. We were generally late to breakfast due to kids, but the staff accommodated some extra time for them.

Room clean & comfortable, an efficient but noisy air conditioning.  Had one evening meal in the restaurant which was well below par. Breakfasts varied & generally good.  On my second visit there were maintenance works being carried on in neighbouring rooms during the day which were very noisy. I was offered a room change but declined as  I had only 48hrs left of my stay.  The local area is fabulous, spent a lot of time in Little India.

couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Very convenient base for getting around Singapore Location and Access – Ideally located between Little India and Bugis and convenient for metro and buses. Access from Changi is about 20 minutes by taxi. In the immediate vicinity a wide range of shops, supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and bars. Anyone with mobility problems should have no difficulty with the location or with the hotel itself

Google Earth - the hotel can be seen on street view

Architectural Style – A low level colonial building (dwarfed by surrounding high rise developments) converted into a courtyard containing the main hotel, separate annex and shops, bars and cafes

Reception – an efficient space with even more efficient personnel. My prior notification of a late arrival was dealt with seamlessly and on departure a query regarding charges was settled without demur and an appropriate refund made

Public Areas/Decor – All public areas are clean and well maintained. There is some outdoor space with seating. The hotel advertises a spa with Jacuzzi, hot steam and keep fit equipment. When I visited the steam bath was not operational and the hot and cold Jacuzzis are crammed into a tiny space. No designated changing area made for impracticalities for users. Although everything looked clean there was a really damp putrid smell from the hot water Jacuzzi - not at all pleasant

Guest Rooms
These are ranged over the main building and annex and come in various categories. We chose to pay a supplement for a larger room in the annex which came with wifi, all day beverages and snacks in a “private” lounge area and free (limited menu) cocktails during “happy hour”. Being in an “inner garden courtyard” we found the room very peaceful with no noise from traffic or neighbouring rooms

Space – Fairly large with ample room. The only window looking onto the interior courtyard garden with no natural light or air

Decor/Maintenance/Cleanliness – Modern fixtures and fittings and neutral colour palette - all cleaned to a good standard - but I could not avoid the occasional smell of damp in the air - like clothes that have been washed but not aired properly!

Furnishing/Bed – A large comfortable king bed with clean linen and good pillows. Side tables, desk and large wardrobe, sofa and side table

Bathroom - Modern and clean with a good shower over a conventional bath Complimentary body wash and shampoo. Towels only just the basic

Amenities including entertainment – The wifi was excellent both in room, everywhere in the hotel and even in adjoining streets! Large modern flat tv with limited channels Complimentary water and in the lounge a Nespresso machine available 24/7

Lighting – Very good and all controlled by a convenient bedside console which also acted as a clock/alarm

Air conditioning worked well but was noisy

Food Offering – Breakfast in the main hotel was international self service buffet style with chef cooking eggs to order. In the annex block a small buffet also laid out for breakfast and evening snacks. Due to the vast range of dining possibilities in Singapore we did not use the restaurant for either lunch or dinner

Green Credentials – Plastic key card needed to activate electricity in room and the usual overtures about guests re using towels etc

Security – 24 hour reception - minisafe in room at an extra charge!

Value for Money – Well, Singapore has just received the accolade of most expensive city in the World and in comparison with other hotels we believed that the rate we were charged was reasonable

X Factor – The location is probably the best feature of this hotel and it is perfectly acceptable as a comfortable bolt hole for a few days touring Singapore. The reception staff also to be commended on their efficiency",2014-02-01,PreCovid,0

,4.0,True,Positive,Albert Court is a Singapore gem Stayed 2 nights beginning of August and would certainly go back again given the chance. The hotel was well situated close to the efficient underground at Little India and ethnic quarters which were good for shops and restaurants. The Albert Court Area is great with a number of excellent restaurants which were good value. As we were staying at the hotel on a room only basis this gave us the chance to venture out and we would recommend both La Café and Patisserie which was amazing value (especially breakfast) with great choice and very friendly staff and the Art College 'canteen' which was also excellent.   Hotel staff very friendly and efficient and gym and jaccuzi were good. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the 'Fragrance' Hotel which was fine and the whole atmosphere,2013-08-01,PreCovid,0

I've stayed here twice in the last two years and have found the rooms vary a lot in terms of comfort, level of shabbiness and noise.

Rooms are sizeable (by Singapore standards) and they have the usual hot water kettle, free coffee/tea, nice TVs etc.  The architecture of the hotel is nice and different from the usual high-rise hotels, it's built on the original layout of the shophouse so it's quaint.  Location-wise it's quite near town, but I think if you're not familiar with the Singapore streets getting to the train station will be challenging.  My main beef was that housekeeping threw away my 2 of my toiletry bottles!  This was very annoying and if it had been at the start of my stay I would have been quite put out.

Our room was very comfortable/cool and clean.  The Nespresso machine was a pleasant change from the crap we'd had all over Europe for 4 weeks.  The hotel is in a good location.  Plenty of shopping/eating options.  The train stop at Little India is only 100mtrs away.  Only downside was the club lounge package wasn't what we have become use to at other chains we've stayed at.  There was only one cocktail per person per night and only a small selection of nibbles.  The breakfast was more than adequate for us.  Would definitely stay there again.",2012-10-01,PreCovid,0

solo,3.0,True,Neutral,"Bathroom mouldy and poor breakfast service The location was ideal for me.

The front desk reception was very helpful.I left my jewellery when i left for the airport and was assisted by the reception to retrieve it.

However the bathrooms are mouldy.I had asked for a change of room and the second one was brighter but The bathroom was still mouldy.

The buffet breakfast service was disappointing. In a busy restaurant, we were asked to look for available table ourselves. In the end when asked waitress to help, she accidentally cleared a guest's table. It was embarrassing for us when the guest came back and found his table taken.

During the one week stay, I noticed no change in the breakfast food variety.

The egg chef kept disappearing so some guests were not even aware he was serving.
The tea and coffee was self served so the minute you get up to grab a drink, your food get cleared away.

The waitresses are not very service orientated, no smile or acknowledgement when spoken to. They were eating the food behind the counter at one point around 10am ! Even though the teapots and milk jugs were empty and new guests were still coming in for breakfast.

It was not clear where the swimming pool/ spa was situated.

We stayed there two nights, one night at each end of our holiday as a stopover.

The gym was well used by my friend who said it was fine.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely return. ",2005-10-01,PreCovid,0

Our room was on the 1st floor with a view of the courtyard which is occupied by a number of shops & well attended restaurants. We thought our room was very spacious with a lovely firm king size bed, nice work table, sitting chair, room to stretch your legs, icy air conditioning & a nice bath to relax in.  +5minutes walk to Little India MRT station depending on the traffic light crossing. +5 minutes walk from Tekka market which offers a myriad of Indian, Chinese, Malaysian style foods & more!

,1.0,True,Negative,"Did not like This was my first trip to Singapore and I was going to stay for a week. I booked this hotel using Internet before I read the review to the guy fro LA, that stayed at the Hotel July 2005.  During check in I asked for a room in the new wing, and got it. Had to pay extra because it was a larger room, that is OK. The service during check in was good. When I got to the room I got surprised!  The room was on ground floor, the window was out to the hallway, and it really did smell bad. I had a feeling that the room was dirty! The next morning the drain in the sink did not work, I asked to get it fixed. I came back 8 hours later and it was still not fixed! But they got it fixed that night.  The air-condition is making a lot of noise, much more than I have noticed other places.  Overall,",2005-11-01,PreCovid,0
,3.0,True,Neutral,"Good location We enjoyed being in the Little India area rather than the glitz of Orchard Road. Close to MRT station and range of Indian restaurants.  Room was on the ground floor, clean and modern.  The shower was over a high bath so check your room if you have problems with this. Cooked breakfast wasn't very hot and the continental selection was modest.  Tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to go to the kitchen to get milk. ",,,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"Great Hotel! I stayed at the Albert Court for three weeks during a business trip in July and August.  I was given a lovely room in the new wing –  king sized bed, large desk to work at, wireless internet service, and a large clean marble bathroom.  The room had great air conditioning, coffee and tea service, and decent daily maid service. The new wing had the feel of a spa with beautiful foliage and water features as well as a comfortable lobby. Right below my room were incredible outdoor restaurants, one North Indian/Nepali and the other Indonesian that had delicious and very reasonably priced meals. I am vegetarian and the Indonesian restaurant was more than happy to cook me an assortment of meals that fit my diet (this was not a problem at the Indian/Nepali restaurant because most of",2005-08-01,PreCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"We would stay here again We stayed at the Albert Court in June 2005. It was our first trip to Singapore, so we tried to choose a hotel that would be well located. We didn't realise how great the location was until we arrived. The hotel is right on the edge of Little India, and within walking distance of Orchard Road. We even walked to Raffles from the Albert Court, (but after a few slings we got a trishaw back!)  Our room was in the new wing, which has great water features. The room was clean and quite big, with a good sized bathroom. There was a shower and a bath. We had breakfast a few times, and it was quite good with a good choice of food and drinks.

The rooms are clean, the staff helpful and the breakfasts not bad (satisfactory: basic) We had never been to Singapore before and would stay here again. Little India is near by and a must. Lots of food courts nearby too. Old world charm outside with a modern inside, however, we did wake up with a few bites; this may be coincidental. We didn't see any insects etc. ",2005-08-01,PreCovid,0
,1.0,True,Negative,"Wouldn't recommend I and my friend stayed at this place this past weekend. We didn't like it at all. They put us in a corner room which has a weird construction. The room itself is so small that they have to put a TV on the right hand side pararell to the bed which you won't be able to watch unless you move it (even the maid said that). The refrigerator is only for decoration because it doesn't quite working. The carpet is very dirty and disgusting (bring your own slipper if you will stay at this hotel). Above all, the girl at a reception desk is not very smart. Will not stay here again. ",2005-07-01,PreCovid,0

,4.0,True,Positive,"Loved this place, good for family We stayed in Albert Courts new courtyard rooms in June 05 with 2 children and 2 adults. We had a King sized bed and a large single bed. We found the rooms to be excellent and the staff were helpful and friendly. The location was great for us right in Little India and we ate curry to our hearts content. The kids were happy here too, there was a small spa and sauna area located in the main building. We didn't eat breakfast here but we walked across to the Tekka Centre and ate cheaply. There is a small fridge in the room to keep drinks etc in. Air con worked well. This was a great hotel for the money S$165 our only complaint was large groups arriving late with children screaming up and down slamming doors until midnight, but hey, such is life right??

,3.0,True,Neutral,"Good Bang for your Buck Recently stayed in Albert Court for a long weekend in a room in the new wing. Pretty basic and straighforward accomodations, with a decent stab at contemporary style, pretty well-appointed bathroom. I definitely agree with other reviewers that it is a good deal. I cannot comment on the rooms in the ""old"" wing, but the breakfast was pretty lousy. If you must eat it, get it included in the room deal! Seemed to be a few tour buses rolling in and out the place, making the reception a little crowded now and then, but its not a factor if you are in the new wing. Not conveniently located to Singapore's shopping center, but a quick taxi or metro ride will get you there fast. If you happen to be a tech enthusiast, Sim Lim City is a couple of blocks away, with 6 stories of every",2005-07-01,PreCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"Old-style charm Stayed in the new wing, facing the court yard. Loved the room, newly refurbished but old-style charming interior without overdoing it. Bathroom is modern and nice. Very hospitable and helpful staff. The only drawback is the off-location to the city-center and subway, you have to walk a lot (or take a taxi), but would have costed at least double the price elsewhere.",,,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"Hassel Free Stay We stayed in this hotel in Autumn 2004, stopping over ion our way to Australia. It was our first time in Singapore. The Hotel was easy to get to, and the room was really clean and was quite stylish and well appointed. It is well layed out although the reception is limited. Its cheap and you can certainly get your monies worth. Its very close to the Little India area of the city, which is ""very"" busy, but full of good food places.
Really friendly staff who speak perfect english and I would stay their again.
Only downside was the lack of respect by others arriving and shouting or even sceaming down the corridors!!",,,0
business,2.0,True,Negative,"Only for tourists on a low budget Stayed in this hotel for 4 days during the middle of January. This is not a good hotel to stay in unless you are only looking for a room to sleep at night, which is about all that you can do here.

The room I stayed in was on the 3rd floor and was supposed to be a ""superior"" room. As soon as I got out of the elevator, I was greeted with a row of mattresses stacked on the wall in front (the matresses remained there throughout my stay). The bright red carpet in the passages had lots of black stains. There is an almost overpowering smell of strong deoderant/disinfectant in the hallways which I never got used to.

The room itself was rather small and worn out. The walls in the room had lots dirty scratches and bruises indicating the wierd times it must have seen. The TV had only 9 channels, 4 of them remained blank and the only worthwhile movie channel had continuous sound problems. Later on I discovered CNN that could only be accessed via some odd combination of keys on the remote. The in-room telephone worked only intermittently as I had a lot of complaints from callers who said I wasn't picking up the phone while I was in my room.

The bathroom was pretty old and not entirely clean. Dirt and grime was fairly obvious in the tiled floor and you could only use the bathtub to take a shower (for obvious reasons).

There isn't much of a concept of ""service"" in the hotel. A bare-bones room service is only available after 6:30pm and then only for 4 hours. Laundry is only collected in the morning and you can forget about getting your cloths pressed at any time of the day. An iron and ironing board is available, though on first-come first-served basis.

There is just the one restaurant on the 1st floor that serves breakfast, dinner and lunch. Breakfast is a reasonable buffet and you do not have the option to have anything extra like eggs. The same restaurant puts table covers on their tables when serving lunch and dinner (which I did not try).

There are no taxis available from the front of the hotel, you have to go a couple blocks to the rear of the hotel to hail a cab.

So all in all, if you are only looking for a cheap place to stay at night, this hotel could be considered. Forget about it if you are a business traveller.",2005-01-01,PreCovid,0

,4.0,True,Positive,"Albert Court Spent a week at the Albert Court at end June 2004. Got a special deal on the rack rate for a courtyard room as it appears to be slow season; paid half the listed price, although for this we only got one breakfast between the two of us. However as they give you vouchers it is easy enough to share them and eat elsewhere the rest of the time.

Hotel is very smart and clean, room spacious and well airconditioned (almost too well!) with attached modern bathroom (bath and shower). Surprisingly quiet too; we faced on to the courtyard with the noise from Bukit Timah road blocked by the main hotel building. Room thoroughly serviced every day, has fridge (not very cold), free tea and coffee with kettle, TV with two free movie channels and channels in English, Chinese and Malay. Hotel has restaurant but no other facilities, in an ideal world a pool would have been good, Sentosa is not the cleanest water in the world!

Well located, five mins walk or less from Little India metro (new line opened 2003) and bus stop. Good Indian restaurant in courtyard, or cross road to the Foodmore foodcourt for the ultra-cheap version, open until about 10pm.

Would stay again.",,,0
