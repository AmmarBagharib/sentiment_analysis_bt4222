family,4.0,True,Positive,"City center, well kept rooms, quiet and friendly. Helped us with a left behind item with complete ownership Stayed 7 nights with family, we had booked two rooms, and they were allocated on the same floor as requested.

The rooms were well equipped though small in size, however, we were outside throughout most of the day and it didn't make much of a difference.

There's a vending machine on the ground floor and a 711 close by, Clarke Quay restaurants is close by and walkable. The breakfast spread is decent enough, we didn't get tired during our stay.

Cabs are easy to hail, you can get food delivered from apps and the hotel helps with cutlery.

Checkin and check-out were smooth, our rooms were ready when we came in for a late checkin.

One of our rooms were road-facing yet it was very quiet inside.

Overall it was a great experience with the staff...

And importantly, we had left behind a pair of shoes which they helped locate and they coordinated well with me to it delivered to a local contact. They packed the shoes securely after the required verifications from me as well as the delivery person (a local delivery app).

Will I come back or recommend? Yes.",2023-05-01,PostCovid,0
solo,,False,,"Good value for money Really good value for money. The rooms are mosern and clean but on the small side which was perfectly fine for a weekend trip. The location is a 7min walk from the MRT (Clarke Quay or For Canning). Also good starting point for a morning walk along the river, so even though it isn't right in the middle of the action it is a good place to explore from. They have a storage room for when your flight back goes late at night and offererd to use the gym shower after check out if I needed it. The gym itself was rather small and open air type so the air was pretty warm and thick, not great for cardio. The pool and roof top terrace were great and the breakfast, whilst not luxurious, it was well presented and enough to get you started (scramled eggs, bacon, toast, fruit, salad, cakes, asian choices). Really liked that you could sit outside.",2023-06-01,PostCovid,0

The hotel staff are all very friendly, hardworking, welcoming, helpful and still maintains respectful of residents' privacy and busy schedules. I was on a business and leisure stay for a week. Loved it, and would come back again.  This HIE at Clarke Quay has one of the best multicultural and nutritious breakfast buffet that I had enjoyed every morning. I was able to have a Starbucks-like sit down area in the side lobby to chat with my local guests. The meat pies are delicious, from the bakery/coffee place nearby the front desk area.  I ordered *FoodPanda delivery twice, the receptionists were very helpful.  They also helped ordered Zig taxis for me many times.  Great roof top view for city skyline and sunrise, plus an unexpected lusciously green flower garden up there.  High ceiling room with large slanting window made the space comfortable and welcoming.

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Good Value Hotel near City Centre Staff
The staff were all helpful and friendly.

Location
The hotel is an easy walk to three MRT stations on different lines – Clake Quay, Chinatown and Fort Canning. The first two are largely covered walks – important for both the rain and the sun.
Depending on your length of stay, the MRT Tourist Tickets could be very useful. For a week’s stay I bought two * three days cards which cover all buses and metro – although not the Sentosa Express but that is only SGD4.
It is also close to the river with its restaurants – although, the best ones closest to the hotel (Jumbo and Iguana) were often full and you could not even make a reservation – a pity as they were quite good.

Rooms
I paid extra for a higher floor room expecting some sort of view. All I got was view of the 7th floor of the offices opposite instead of the 5th floor!
The room itself was a standard hotel room and adequately equipped – although the bed was rather too firm for my taste.

Breakfast
The breakfasts were fine – a fair range of dishes. The coffee was very good the fruit juice - direct from the carton – less so!

Pool
The roof top pool was very interesting and a good way to cool off a bit after a hard day out.

Dangers
There is a glass shelf above the ‘fridge with a very sharp corner on which I banged my head two or three times. The shelf needs raising – I am not that tall – or it needs some protection covering the corner.",2023-07-01,PostCovid,0
,4.0,True,Positive,"Great value for money but small rooms. Great location for shopping, dinner and walks. The room rate was cheaper than other similar styles of hotels so do your homework. Whilst the room sizes were very small by comparison to other hotels the other facilities made up for it. Great roof top pool, complimentary breakfast (not a great variety but had hot and cold dishes as well as patisserie), fantastic location for the River, Clark Quay, Orchard Road shopping, China town all in walking distance. Great value for money. Taxi from airport was about Sing$35. We arrived early in the morning and the hotel was at maximum capacity hence we could not check into our room until 1pm.

,1.0,True,Negative,"Small rooms Size of the room is inversely proportional to the price of the room. Rooms very very small, price is too high for the size of the room. All rooms are of same size, only difference is the floor. If you are lucky, you can get room with road/city view. If you are unlucky then you’ll get room facing other rooms, and you might not open curtains/blinds for privacy leading you to feel claustrophobic. This hotel offers all rooms with compulsory breakfast, whether you like it or not, because there is “NO in room dining” facility in this hotel.  The walk to MRT is about 10 mins, so if it’s raining, then you need to wait for it to stop or take a cab.  If you are travelling as a family with small children, all the best, because you’ll be needing two rooms if you want some space to move",2023-06-01,PostCovid,0

Special mention to Stephanie on reception who was just fantastic and got our rooms ready by 11:00 with no fuss - she is friendly and genuine as were her colleagues.   Breakfast is busy, plentiful and has something for everyone.  The rooftop pool is a welcome retreat from the humidity and was never too busy.

It provides for business and leisure travellers in Singapore a perfect combination of price and service. The proximity to the touristy and central locations is very convenient.
What blew me away me this time: the bartender at the hotel bar. His name is War, and he was just amazing! Him running around serving multiple customers in the bar area and the outside seating area certainly brought him to his limits, but he always showed a smile and encouraged his customers to just „enjoy“ life to the right level.

The hotel is gorgeous with an amazing outdoor covered terrace. The bartender, War, is very accomondating and considerate. I told him I wanted to take a walk, he handed me an umbrella. I told him I was hungry after the kitchen closed, he offered to whip something up. Great service.

The hotel has a very nice pool if you line swimming

(1) location is decent but need to walk 5-10’ to nearest MRT or Bus stops. It’s between Clarke Quay MRT and Chinatown MRT, good enough if you don’t mind walking. For shopaholic fans, you may really consider carrying many bags on the way home unless you decide to use grab/taxi instead. Bus station is nearest -4-5’ walking distance, has direct route to Orchard, Vivocity. (2) foods is tasty, big portions and served by the staff but not enough meat, just very simple dishes like stir-fry noodles, scrambled eggs, toast etc - around 6-10 to choose from (Apr’22).

- Breakfast: inedible, disgusting. I can bet you get better service and food in prison.
Powder eggs, the lowest quality bread, super sweet cartoon juices, basically you can't eat anything from this hotel. The manager should be ashamed for serving such an unhealthy and bad quality food to the guests.
You get served by incompetent staff, they treat you like a prison inmate. They are clearly not well-trained to work in a hotel, they could barely speak English.
At the breakfast you will experiment what is to be in a refugee camp, a lot of people in line with B.O (body odor), horrible smell, they do not respect the minimum social distancing, staff does not care!

- Room: minimal size even for Singapore standards. Cleaning was made whenever they felt like it.

- Technical staff (IT-aircon) should shower before entering to the rooms. We had the same problems with the wifi guys, they sent 2 guys, we could not handle their body odor! Incredible, like they did not take shower in ages. After 5 minutes we had to leave the door open for a while trying to get the smell out of our room.
The manager, Ms. Sue is clearly incompetent for this job. It's unacceptable to hire people that smell so bad, at least provide them with clean uniforms. She is in charge of the breakfast as well.

- Customer services, 1/10. Called to get clean towels, it took app 1 hour and 3 calls. They do not have a proper training. Clear mismanagement problems.

I get down to see the duty manager and he tries to tell me it is my fault fo not paying a deposit, when I checked in there was not discussion of paying a depart as i had prepaid, equally no one advised me that services and my personal property will be withheld until i pay.

Recently one of our South Indian Super Star had created a controversy by stating about the facilities given by Singapore Govt to its citizens for the taxation while promoting his film and demeaning newly enforced  Indian GST  .Whatever may be the hidden agenda of that actor who is a known Income tax defaulter , for me  in spite of all its attractions Singapore is a place that does not have heart ,life or charm. Singaporeans have lost the beauty of life in there labyrinth of rules and fines. The city is very clean but does not have a character. In its place see any of our Indian metros , for the population we are ,though we may be a bit behind on cleanliness but at least the people are happy and all our cities have there own character and attraction.

,4.0,True,Positive,"First time in Singapore Upon arrival into Singapore we received a bit of help to schedule/pay for a hotel shuttle bus to take us to our hotel. It was pretty easy,Convenient and most of all economical. We arrived to our hotel and check in was a breeze. Lobby area is small and pretty compact but clean and comfortable. After checking in we want to our rooms which we found were incredibly small. They were honestly fit for just 1 person. Not really a good fit for 2. The view from the room wasn't bad, but it wasn't as it we were seeing the city. I think we were on the 6th or 4th floor. The corridors/passageway to get to the rooms were very narrow as well. 2 people could not walk beside each other in these corridors. Breakfast was pretty decent and ok but could have had more food options. Whatever you do, do not request a corner room, those are much smaller than the ones we had. There is a rooftop pool looking out over the surrounding area which is really nice. There is a changing room there as well as bathrooms. The pool isn't something that's big and deep. The water catches you like waist deep or a little above. There is also a jacuzzi. There is a small bar/cafe for simple things such as baked goods, cakes,  coffee, wine. There is an outdoor area beyond the lobby which is quite cozy but carries with that the street noise. Right behind the front desk is the dining area. They had basic amenities in the rooms. A safe, iron/iron board, blowdryer. They had a phone that once activated and set up could be used off premises as a navigation guide to get around.i had never seen or encountered that before from any other hotel, so I thought that was cool. The front desk helped us set it up. The staff was friendly enough and helpful. Language barrier was not an issue. They also have an area to store your luggage for you ( well guarded)  if you have a late flight after check out hours. They do charge additional for late check out. They gave us a courtesy hour after the scheduled check out time, which I thought was very generous. They did schedule our pick up to the airport. Prices were reasonable. We used a van as opposed to a car as it was 4 of us. Not quite sure I would stay here again, but I won't say never. ☺️😊",2019-05-01,PreCovid,0

Rooms were a little on the small side but they honoured my request of high floor away from lift. We didn’t use the pool or bar as were out exploring most of the time. Breakfast was busy, struggled to get a table, and food was basic. Didn’t always have baked beans and no pork (bacon/sausage) served. Good selection of pastries.

Staff were friendly and we were able to have our luggage delivered to the hotel from airport using LuggAgent and they stored it for us on our last day as well.

Great hotel for exploring the city.",2019-08-01,PreCovid,0

Breakfast option is also much more than the other holiday inn express I have stayed before.

Swimming pool is another highlight, even better than some 5 star hotel.

And this is the only express hotel I can find Bluetooth speaker.

Room design is special, I love the windows.

,4.0,True,Positive,"Good Value for Money i stayed here for the 2nd time with my family quite recently and once again they never fail to disappoint me. Although check in was a little slow for my liking due to trouble with getting the room card, all went well and the rooms were always clean and housekeeping even helped to fold some of our clothes nicely even though it wasn't really needed. That is a very nice touch.

The room maybe a little small to my liking but still good enough to move around with enough leg spaces.The shower temperature was easy to adjust although you do have to keep the door closed at all times to prevent flooding.

Breakfast was ok and the choices of food were alright. Nothing too fancy to shout about for what you pay for i guess. However the difference maker here was the people serving us at breakfast. They were always smiling, didnt seem fussed and always on hand to support the guests requests. Special thanks to Heng and the other people working the breakfast shift during the national day week. It may have been busy and you even took time to mingle with some of us guests and truly made us feel at home. Thanks once more!",2019-08-01,PreCovid,1

We picked it because of it's positive reviews and central location. The location was indeed good, walkable distance to Clarke Quay and Chintown so we didn't have any problems finding good food and night life in the evenings. We found our room very small however and somewhat claustrophobic. Not helped by the fact that our window faced out to a very small inner courtyard and therefore there was very little natural light. Opposite were other rooms and so we couldn't open the nets otherwise people could've seen into our room.

Its a bit of rabbit warren but once you've worked out the corridors and lifts it's not to bad. The staff are helpful and it is close to most amenities.

Behind the hotel was the river and there was a bridge across to quite a few bars and restaurants. We paid just below RM500 per night or just under £100 per night which was not too bad. It was close enough to central and amenities and rooms were acceptable. Pillows were a bit soft. There was a small gym at the rooftop and a lap pool.

business,1.0,True,Negative,"Very Frustrating Hotel To Deal With.......... I booked a room at this hotel for end of June 2019 for a few nights and had to pre-pay upfront. All Good. I got a message that my MRI had been moved forward right when I was having my break in Singapore, consequently I had to cancel the trip. Singapore Airlines were brilliant and refunded all of my airfare without question or hassle. This hotel on the other hand, has given me the run around beyond belief!!
I called the hotel reservations line and the lady there was brilliant, she actually suggested that since this was a medical issue she would get approval to refund my total charges.....she put me on hold. A gentleman by the name of Shafiq came on the line, had to explain my situation all over a again to him. he said he would send me an email to confirm the conversation and the next steps......you guessed it...NOTHING in the last few days. I have called the hotel five times now, Shafiq is always busy and does not return calls.

I have been an IHG member for more than 15 years, most of those years I have been SPIRE.....this hotel has no idea what loyalty means. Loyalty does not work one way!!!

As you can no doubt imagine, this hotel will not be getting my or my company's custom anytime soon!!",2019-05-01,PreCovid,0

The staff are absolutely amazing. And will do anything to make you comfortable. The rooms are clean and tidy but extremely small for a couple looking to stay a few days. It will be ok for an over night tho. For a single person this is an ideal hotel. I would like to mention Rosa from the front desk who did put in a lot of effort to get us transferred to the Holiday Inn Atrium where the rooms are larger with all amenities. And the duty manager Elaine, who made the transfer happen at no extra cost. Amazing customer service. Well done guys.

Unfortunately, the door isn’t made to keep sound out, we were woken about 6 times throughout the early hours by groups of people talking normally outside as they walked passed. Our friends in another room had the same experience. Very frustrating as we had an early flight and I’d say not very practical if you’re on a business trip.   Also, breakfast buffet was very disappointing. Very limited selection for westerners. In terms of hot savoury, they only had eggs, tiny sausages, and a bowl of corned beef that looked like dog food.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Everything you need. Nothing you don't. Really well located Holiday Inn with stylish modern design, comfortable rooms and great breakfast. We stayed four nights.

Hotel is within sight of Fort Canning MRT. If you leave the station and face Liang Court you should be able to see it on your right about 300m away. There's a footpath along the main road or walk through the park. It's not the easiest walk if you have heavy luggage. There's a flatter walk from Clarke Quay MRT station via Riverside Point and Merchant Road. It's also only 15 minutes walk to Chinatown MRT.

Our room was on 5th floor. Floor to ceiling window, decent aircon, good sized TV with plenty of English language content including Sky News and BBC World. Comfortable bed with great pillows. Tea and coffee making facilities, hairdryer and ironing board. Modern stylish bathroom with rain showerhead.

Breakfast was busy most of the time but there was a lot of seating in an attractive indoor outdoor setting. Food choices included local favourites which were well worth trying but a bit spicy for our tastes at breakfast. Otherwise it was a changing choice each day included scrambled egg, bacon, chicken sausage, ham plus wide range of continental items. There was a pancake maker toast, bakery items, cereals, yoghurt etc. Juices rotated and there was tea and cappuccino etc. Al in all a great way to start the day with a leisurely breakfast. The glacier keeping the breakfast room clean and tidy were doing a fantastic job.

The roof had a long narrow pool with a glass side and hot tub. There was space to sunbathe and umbrellas for shade- though not always open. Pool towels were available. It was a clever use of space and created a pleasant area to spend a little time. Good views out across the city.

Service was great throughout and front desk staff were very helpful and efficient. After we checked out we left our bags which were stored in a fenced area outside the entrance which is overlooked by security and cameras. As people say elsewhere, it's not air conditioned so avoid leaving things which can melt.

Good Wi-Fi. Very little not to like. It's a bit further away from the centre so a premium taxi from Changi was $S35. Could be a bit closer to the MRT. Slightly expensive for HIX but generally better so I'd happily stay again.",2019-03-01,PreCovid,0

I asked for my IHG number to be added at check In, this was not done so no points, pointless complaining as staff don’t care.

The rooms were small but not a problem. Beds and pillows were comfortable and we had a high floor which I recommend.

The only benefit I could get from the hotel was 10% off the really expensive bar and food. None of which I partook.

Room was clean, but small, as is the case in Asia. Smimming pool on the roof was a novelty and was long and slim, with a whirlpool at one end. Gym was minute and not a lot in there. It’s also on the roof.

There were a few very expensive vending machines in the hotel and again I did not use any of them.

Breakfast was a bit of a bun fight, but to be fair it was ok. Sit outside to avoid the noise. If you were staying nearby and paying for breakfast, you could walk in and help yourself and no one would know, as no room numbers or keys are looked at. Maybe that’s why it’s so busy?

,5.0,True,Positive,"Far exceeded expectations I was debating staying here as I thought it would be pretty mediocre. Boy was I wrong. This hotel was fantastic! The room was clean & nice. It wasn't a large room, but the layout & floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel spacious.   The free breakfast buffet didn't blow my mind, but it had a great selection of both Western & local foods. It was a great way to fuel me for tourist activities throughout the day.  The staff was very pleasant from arrival through departure.   The one drawback I had was that it wasn't in the most convenient location. It was near most things, but you still had a good 10-15 minute walk to get to most places you would want to (metro stop, convenience store, shopping, dining, etc.).

Since it is an Express property the rooms are not hugh, but are surely functional with all amenities available. The property does not have an option of rooms with king size beds and all the rooms have queen size beds, so a couple sharing bed with a child gets a bid cramped for space.

Before I get to the main review just to note its a fair walk to Clarkes Quay from the hotel.. Its one of those trips too short for taxi and 15/20 min walking. However we progressed and walked tyne entire 2l3 days. The hotel is fairly new and the public areas are vast clean and very user friendly. This however ends when you check into your room as this must be the smallest hotel rooms ever.. Bathroom is tiny and so is the bed.. Very little room for luggage.

Our first room was looking literally on a wall of the adjacent building so we asked to move as this was too claustrophobic. We got moved to another side of the building with no wall thank goodness. The pool on the roof is quite nice though when we visited there was so much claurine in it that it literally took three trips to the shower to wash it off. Overall this feels like a 3 star hotel.

business,5.0,True,Positive,Compact and homely I always find this as a very attractive option over other so called  luxury hotels in SG.So very functionally designed it does not make u wander around unnecessarily at the hotel. Smart layout and smart people at front desk who r quick and prompt. Hotel rooms mostly in Singapore are not very big and this one is similar.But it has full windows and good natural light if u get the ones closer to Clark quay side. Take the elevator to the terrace and u have a great views to Clark quay at night. The roof top pool is tranquil and u get fresh air without going out of hotel premises. The gym is functional. The bar behind the front desk has some of the most value offers for a drink and snack I’ve found at SG hotels. Clark quay is 7 mins walk and there is a good Indian restaurant Annapurna 2-3 mins away where u pay as much u like for good Indian veg buffet meal. Breakfast area is large and has different seating arrangements which u can chose as per u mood.I prefer this property over several luxury properties in SG. Feel like going back!,2018-06-01,PreCovid,0

This Holiday Inn Express puts focus and effort into what matters for customers in SERVICE, friendliness, customer responsiveness and they reduce costs by doing away with things you don't need; like there are carts out front for your luggage which you then take to your room (no bellmen) but lots of receptionists and other hotel workers to help as needed. The LOCATION in Clarke Quay is very near 2 metro stations. Just across the road from Rivertown (Clarke Quay, Roberston Quay), just blocks from Chinatown and metro (MRT) connections-- so easy.

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Helpful staff, great breakfast, great atmosphere, WiFi  First the positives.  The breakfast was terrific.  Fluffy, delicious eggs prepared slightly different each day. They had a great selection of items like sausage, bacon, fruits, cereals, croissants, muffins etc.  As it’s important to start the day with a good breakfast, every day started well.  Location is great as Clark Quay and Robertson Quay are short walks away as is Chinatown.  The MRT stops are all a good half mile walk so be ready for that.  WiFi is fantastic throughout the hotel.  Never one issue the entire 5 night stay.  And I loved the outdoor seating area adjacent to the dining area.  Staff is super helpful as well.  Rooms were cleaned each day.  Rooms aren’t huge but for  a solo traveler it was fine.   Two things kept me from a 5 star rating.  First, the jacuzzi was not working.  The jets were on but the water would not heat up.  I had run the marathon during my visit and was really hoping to take a post race soak.  No dice.   The rooftop pool is nice for the view but the pool itself is nothing special.  The other thing was my view looked out onto absolutely nothing.  I chose the place in part because on the website it looked like the rooms looked out onto the river or city.  I guess someone has to get shafted.  And I was one of them.  I made the most of it though.  But they lose half a point!

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Really glad I stayed here... I stayed here for 4 nights in December 2017 during the Christmas period. I was with my family (together there were 6 adults and 1 child who was 3 years old). I am really glad we stayed here. The hotel is family friendly, looks really nice from the outside as well as the inside and provides a great breakfast. In fact I was very impressed with the breakfast selection. It was buffet style but there was a good variety from pastries, eggs, sausages, fruits and yoghurts. They also served asian food such as curry and rice on a couple of the mornings.

The rooms itself were basic - quite small for 2 people to be honest and more comfortable for 1 person to stay in - but this was not an issue as Singapore is a place where you spent most of your time outdoors exploring so the only time we spent in the hotel was at night to sleep!

Location wise was excellent. There was a 'Friends style cafe' (based on the American TV show) right outside the hotel which was really cool as they served food as well as coffee, milkshakes etc. The station (Chinatown MRT) was approximately a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Sometimes the 10 minutes did feel like a long walk after a long day of sightseeing and being on my feet! On the walk to the station you pass through a main road ('Chinatown') which has loads of shops and restaurants.

There is a rooftop pool which was nice and also a mini bar type set up (serving only soft drinks and beer) on the rooftop. The view from the rooftop was really nice at night time when everything is lit up.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Wow.....A Great Hotel This was my first trip to Singapore and I chose this hotel as the base for my husband and I to explore Singapore from. I can say i think i made the perfect choice.

Now we have been around Singapore i would say Clarke Quaye is the best area to stay in. We were spending four nights in this hotel, followed by two nights in a hotel in Kuala Lumpur, and then a final two nights in the Marina Bay Sands hotel on our return to Singapore before we flew home. Hand on heart I can honestly say I preferred this hotel to the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

Ok so what did I like? firstly the location. It's a great area and close to a few hawker centres, Chinatown, including 'Food Street' where we had the best food (noodles and satay). The pool is fantastic (nice and quiet when we were there), the breakfast was great (full english). Air con superb, hairdryer, toiletries all there and good.

One little negative is the room was tiny, the smallest hotel room I think I have ever stayed in. When I come back and I will come back. I'm going to see if this hotel has any larger rooms, as there was a serious lack of floor space for walking around the bed and for the suitcases.

My top tip would be to take a little boat trip from Clarke Quaye to Marina Bay Sands area to orientate yourself when you arrive. It's a great way to start. We arrived In the evening so we took a little walk to Chinatown on our first evening and in the morning at 10am we went for the boat trip and we were the only people on the boat.

I cannot give any information on the MTR as taxi's were so cheap and easy to find that we took taxis everywhere when not walking. But we did lots of walking.

On our final day before we left for Kuala Lumpur we took a sightseeing bus tour just to make sure we hadn't missed anything and we hadn't, but the rest for our legs was needed and well deserved.

Don't forget to visit Santosa Island if only to ride the cable car and The Luge. Get a taxi and start your cable car ride from the very top Mount Faber. And when we went Raffles Hotel was having a refurb so we couldn't go in, but we did get a Singapore Sling from the pop up bar next door. It was
good.

Singapore has to be one of the most beautiful and clean places i have ever visited. I will be back to this Holiday Inn soon.",2018-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,"Business hotel It was my first time to stay at this hotel. Check in was quick and available early. Despite making separate bookings for me and my colleague, only one room was initially processed. However, this was quickly corrected, and another room was available right away. My room was an inner unit and looked out into the hall. Next time, I'll make sure to specify a room with a view that looks out of the building. The room had a basic bed and pillows which were marked as either ""firm"" or ""soft."" Somehow I could not distinguish between them, but they were comfortable. The slipper provided easily tore. The bathroom, which was quite small, had a dispenser for soap and shampoo. The TV channels available are quite limited. On my second day, I asked for housekeeping, but apparently, the comforter and the sheets were not changed because the stains were still there. Pluses about this hotel: bottled water is available at the dining area in addition to those provided in the room. Breakfast to go is provided as an option and you can have bread, fruit, and coffee to take with you. The food choices are quite limited and mostly consisted of chicken and egg, to which I'm allergic, so I had to make do with yogurt, bread and fruits. The butter croissant is delightful, buttery, soft and yummy. Luggage storage is available in front of the hotel. Finding a cab should not be problem here. This is also within walking distance to Clarke Quay area. Try to explore the roofdeck area with a pool and a view. The room I had was big enough for one or two persons but will not do if you have children. There is barely enough area to move in. This hotel also provides an Android phone you can use. It has free international calls to select countries. Wifi is available and stable anywhere inside the hotel. The checkout process was quick.

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Loved my short stay in Singapore! I stayed here for 3 nights before flying on to Bali.

The hotel is in a great location & you can easily walk to most of the main sights, however it does get tiring in the heat so I used the hop on hop off bus and the odd taxi to get around too.

The staff were nice & friendly. I had to call someone up to my room at midnight one night as the electrics went but a maintenance man turned up within 5 minutes and sorted them out for me.

The rooms are small but cosy and for a solo traveller it was perfect. I didn’t spend much time in my room anyway as I was mostly out sightseeing. Bed is comfy & the bathroom has a great shower which was the main things I used in the room. They also supply you with 2 bottles of water a day & the handy phone in the room is great gadget to take out & about with you.

Breakfast was buffet style with a great selection of food to choose from & it tasted good. No complaints from me here!

Also make sure you try the rooftop pool...it’s amazing! It’s great to cool off in here or the jacuzzi after a busy day of sightseeing!

I would highly recommend staying at the Holiday Inn Express, it’s great hotel which doesn’t break the budget!",2018-04-01,PreCovid,0
family,4.0,True,Positive,"Great Budget Hotel We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay for 4 nights at the beginning of April. My family and I were in Singapore for a family wedding and so were looking for a nice, budget hotel to stay in for the duration of our time there.

To start with, the hotel is in a great location right by Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay and it's extremely quick and easy to get a taxi outside of reception to go anywhere further out.

The rooms were nice, slightly on the small side, but this did not matter for us as we didn't spend much time in the room at all. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day throughout our stay. It was perfect for what we required.

The breakfast buffet was lovely, a great choice of foods on offer every single morning so did not disappoint.

Finally, our highlight of the hotel, was the rooftop pool. A great addition to a budget hotel where we spent most of our mornings relaxing before a day of exploring. The hot tubs were great and always clean.

Overall, it exceeded our expectations for a budget hotel but it was just that, budget. It wasn't particularly fancy but had everything we needed for our stay.",2018-04-01,PreCovid,0

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Quality Budget Hotel that is Close to Clarke Quay and Marina Bay - No Pampering! Hey Everyone,
As a family we prioritise our budgets and look for a mix of Luxurious Holidays and Budget Friendly get aways too. Singapore is one destination that is great for a family holiday and is easy to get to from any part of India.

Holiday Inn Express, Clarke Quay - located on the Magazine Road is ideally located to explore all parts of Singapore. As it is their 'Express Offering' you should expect Good locations, Compact rooms, Views aren't great as there are buildings all around, Reasonable spread of food at the Buffet that caters to South Asians and the food didn't disappoint, Quality service in terms of Housekeeping etc.

There is No Room Service, No In-room dining, No Bellboy to help you with the luggage. Although they have a luggage store room which comes in handy when you need it. And this is exactly my point. Stay at this well connected hotel when you don't want anything lavish or that Pampered feeling and explore the city & sights yourself.

The Rooms were kept clean, the hotel reception organised for cabs when we needed them, guided us on basic queries and the breakfast was reasonably good during our stay.

Overall I am glad to have chosen this place. I recommend!

Happy Travelling.",2017-05-01,PreCovid,0

We only had the breakfast one of the days we stayed but it was fine especially being free.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"A total gem We have just checked out from the Holiday Inn Express at Clarke Quay and we were thrilled with our stay.
The location is fantastic: a short stroll to Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, and to the MRT station.
The breakfast has something for everyone, and although it was busy we never saw anything run out as it was continually topped up. There were eggs & bacon every day along with changing accompaniments: sausages/tomatoes/mushrooms. There was bread & pastries, fruit, yoghurts, cereals and porridge.
And they had a station with Indian and Chinese favourites too.
The pool looked great though we didn’t use it. The rooms are small but we didn’t spend much time in it so it didn’t matter, and it was clean and all toiletries were topped up daily along with free bottled water.
The best thing about our stay was the mobile phone in the room. We took it out every day & used it for google maps, or to help find the nearest MRT or rooftop bar, and to call our tour operator to confirm our pickup point.
It proved invaluable.

Check in was nice and easy and the staff friendly. As this is an express hotel you need to take care of your own luggage.

The rooms are not big but for solo or couple they are more than adequate. May be a tight squeeze if there is more than two and you staying longer than a night or two. The rooms are modern and clean. As the hotel is quite new they are well maintained.

Breakfast is included in the rate. Again being an express hotel it is self serve buffet style with both Western and Asian options. In the week that I stayed there the options varied on a daily basis.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Friendly, efficient, well located and does what it avertises. Great value for money. My wife and I stayed at this Hotel: 29th March to 04 April 2018; we were in room 624.
Standard Room, 1 Queen Bed, Non Smoking.

This is a fairly new hotel - built about 3 or 4 years ago (I was living in Singapore at the time of its construction so saw it coming to life) - it still retains a degree of newness about it; bright and airy and being kept in great shape by some very dedicated staff throughout. The housekeeping team during out stay were very good indeed, really on top of their responsibilities - well done to them!

Well located hotel generally especially for buses, MRT, and a constant supply of taxis out front. Short walk to riverside.

Check in smooth and very welcoming: Big thank you to PARINITA DOGRA for warm and most genuine welcome (BEAUTIFUL smile) and very professional in her check in of us, Thank you Parinita! Also to be commended on reception is TIFFANY TOLC - great customer service!

Our room was compact but fully met our needs - we were out a great deal so mainly showering and sleeping. Housekeeping just perfect; fresh bedding daily and bathroom always sparkling on each days return to our room. Room was at end of corridor - no noise at all, internal or external. Bliss! Aircon, hot water, blackout curtains all good, no issues.

Swimming pool on rooftop. Very good used daily by us and Gym also used alternate days by my wife. Spa also at end of pool. Very pleased with all and again we have no issues to report here. Maybe some more deck chairs? I did ask the management to consider placing a clock somewhere on the roof top facilities so....watch that space.

Breakfast included, all you can eat buffet. Self serve, eggs, bacon, sausages, toast, continental, fresh fruit coffee, juices, pastries....I am making myself hungry recalling this....plenty of choice and constantly topped up. Very pleased with this aspect.

The eating area is really lovely with tall ceilings and open aspects, relaxing and generally plenty of seating. Breakfast ends about 10:30 so maybe consider eating earlier only in that when everyone comes at 09:45 ques can form (a bit).

Three washers and three dryers on level 2 cost: $8 sing dollars to wash and same to dry. All worked as they should.

We were there for 6 days so had a good feel of the hotel and its services. Very happy to return there and very happy to recommend.

I spoke to Fiona Ong (Business Development Manager in the hotel) the morning prior to our check out and she was most keen (she was on a 'walk about' asking for customer feedback) to gather feedback so lots of effort here to keep on top of customer experiences. Fiona was just delightful! And took copious notes!

Small point: We extended and paid for our check out until 6pm; housekeeping staff were a little to keen to gain access ('can I clean now?' [5:40]; 'can I clean now [5;50]) it did grate a little as we were rushing to pack and vacate the room and this keenness - not intentionally - introduced a degree of unnecessary pressure. That said I am sure the management will note this comment and give guidelines to avoid rushing extended checkouts.

Overall a very, very positive experience.",2018-04-01,PreCovid,0

Gym is very small and crammed but since this is Singapore, that’s expected.

Rooms are clean and comfortable. Ask for an outside facing room because there are rooms where your only view from your window is the window of the next room. So expect to close your curtains all the time.

Toilet bowl is weird it’s built too high up from the floor. I bet short people’s feet won’t touch the floor when sitting on it.

The service levels offered for an ‘Express’ version of the Holiday Inn chain were surprisingly good. Reception staff were attentive and exceedingly helpful on all interactions, certainly providing service levels on par with higher rated establishments.

Breakfast was a solid offering, a good mix of western, continental, and Asian foods. Plenty of tables, low wait times, prompt table clearance and friendly staff. I wouldn’t expect anyone to go away hungry.

The Queen Bed Room was pleasant. Floor to ceiling windows and outward facing mean lots of light in the room and a view of the city. Good double blinds mean you are not woken in the morning however as light is kept out well. Bathroom was compact with walk in shower. Shower Gel and Handwash provided but no shampoo / conditioner so bring your own in case! Comfortable bed and choice of pillows mean a good night sleep. Couple of added extras with Bluetooth enabled Alarm Clock and Speaker mean you can listen to your preferred tunes and the in-room ‘Handy’ Phone meant internet browsing and trips and tours brought straight to you. Complimentary bottled water appreciated and good tea and coffee making facilities. The in room fridge also useful.

Gym / Fitness Centre is reasonably equipped with a multipurpose weight machine, small selection of free weights and a good selection of CV equipment. A minor improvement here would have been to close the sides of the room (open) and fit with A/C.

Rooftop lap pool was welcoming and well used - the glass sides are certainly unique. The roof area is a nice place to relax but lacked sufficient beds for number of users. That said, nice to have pool towels provided.

The rooms have a kettle with arrangements to make tea / coffee, an ironing board and iron and a small fridge- also a safe.  The buffet breakfast is quite average.

The metro stop is a little far but not too bad, maybe 5 to 10 minutes.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Great 7 night stay at this Hotel! We loved staying at this hotel. We had 7 nights here and we are so glad we booked this hotel in this great area. First off, the communication was great with the staff who answered a couple of questions that I had emailed prior to our stay. As I suffer with sleeping difficulties, I had requested the quietest room available, up high and away from the lifts. This is exactly what we got. We were surprised at how quiet the hotel room was and were not disturbed at all. The housecleaning came into the room every day when we requested and there was a safe to store our valuables. The room itself was so clean and the Queen bed very comfortable with the 2 types of pillows, firm and soft, as promised. We were not at all disappointed with the size of the room as we were aware of the size prior to booking because we read on the booking site we used. Not sure why so many people who write these reviews mention how small the rooms are when it tells them clearly on booking sites? There was plenty of room around the bed, a space for luggage, a desk and desk chair, a floor to ceiling window and very high ceilings that gave the room a feeling of spaciousness. The bathroom was cleverly designed so that everything was not cramped in the space provided. There were multiple shelves for you to place your personals, a good size shower with 2 shower head choices and clean fluffy white towels provided every day.
The reception area and hotel grounds were all very clean and welcoming.
The free breakfast buffet was perfect for our needs. There was also a choice of western style breakfast or Asian style like rice and meat dishes. There were tea, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juices, cereals, toast, eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, sometimes hash browns or waffles, and pastries.The breakfast area was lovely and very clean and the staff attending were very polite. We would fill up as much as we could on breakfast and not need a meal until dinner, so we actually saved a lot of money on meals. A couple of times, we got back late from outings and had a late dinner at the café at the hotel - quiche & salad very nice.
The rooftop area was gorgeous with amazing views even across to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The pool was awesome to float around in to cool off and take in that view. We did not go in the spa or gym but will utilise these next time we visit.
The area of Clarke Quay is amazing! Shopping and plenty of food options to chose from - right on the river, happy hour cocktails everywhere, boat rides down the Singapore river day and night and live music. This is a very lively and vibrant area that really comes alive at night and we always felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night. There is a walkway across the road to Clarke Quay, so no main road to negotiate.
We used the MRT to get around. You can get a 1,2 or 3 day tourist pass for unlimited MRT use. We went everywhere on this fantastic transport system. Very fast and easy to use. If you get a bit lost, there is always staff at the stations to assist you. The longest you have to wait is 5 minutes! The stations are spotless, like the rest of Singapore. We found that Clarke Quay MRT was closer and easier to get to than Chinatown although Chinatown is an interchange MRT.
I must say that staying at this hotel was also a great decision due to the locality to Clarke Quay and the MRT.
We highly recommend this hotel and found that 7 nights was not long enough for us to see and do everything we wanted to in Singapore. We spent 2 full days on Sentosa Island alone. When we do come back, we will have no hesitation to stay here again.

friends,4.0,True,Positive,"Good location, clean and comfortable if a little small Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay for 3 nights before embarking on a Far East cruise.

The hotel itself is in a reasonably good location close to the hub-but of Clarke Quay and the myriad of restaurants and bars. The MRT station for getting around Singapore was only a 5 minute walk away, as was Chinatown.

Check-in and service from the reception was perfect with our room being available at 10am (surprisingly). After a long haul flight this was a godsend!

Our room, although a little on the small side was very clean and comfortable. As a base and really only for sleeping in, it was OK. All expected amenities were available. The free internet also worked well around the hotel.

On the top floor was a glass sided pool, which was fantastic to cool down in from the heat of the day. One negative would be that there was not enough deckchairs around for the number of guests who frequented the pool area. One other negative aspect was that there was little shade from the sun with only one beach umbrella being available.

As a Holiday inn ""Express"" type hotel the facilities were a little limited with a vending machine available for buying soft drinks, water etc.

Breakfast was free and good enough to start the day, if a little busy at times. At times, not all food was replaced as it emptied and this left guests scrambling around for the leftovers.

However, for the price, location, amenities and cleanliness, it is hard to beat this hotel. If I were to travel back to Singapore I certainly would consider it again.",2018-02-01,PreCovid,0

The bedding was excellent and the room was very clean with the exception of the carpet being a little dirty. The breakfast was more than adequate with plenty of choice. The only negative was that the cooked food was not hot enough for my liking. We had to sit in the open air area as there was not a lot of seating in the air conditioned area, but it was a very pleasant atmosphere with plants and tall ceiling.  The hotel has a beaut swimming pool on the top floor looking out over the city. We found that it was easier to take taxis everywhere during the day as we found it too hot to walk from the hotel down to Chinatown.

BEST thing about this place is the ‘handy’ that’s each room has. Basically a phone you can use during your stay and you can take it outside the hotel. SO useful for maps when you’re trying to find places and free to use. Never seen it in any other hotels but so appreciated. Saved us arguing over maps!!
The rooms are very modern - a little small if you have big cases but fine as we only slept here spent all our time exploring the amazing city.
Very good powerful shower and hairdryers in the bathroom.
Breakfast selection is very good, cooked food, fruit, yoghurt but coffee was quite poor. Very basic machine but the friends cafe over the road makes up for it! Definitely worth a visit all friends themed like central perk, they do food but we just had coffees which were very good.

On the rooftop there is an infinity pool (of sorts) and a garden area.  It's a nice respite, and quite lovely to dip into the water after a sweaty Singapore day.  It is missing a restaurant on site, but it serves the fantastic breakfast in the morning and we tend to stay away from eating at hotels.  Across the street is ""Central Perk"" based on the cafe in Friends, and there are food courts and many traditional restaurants within walking distance.  My one complaint: there is a strange level change when you go into the bathrooms.  It's not even an inch, yet it kept tripping me up.  After staying here twice you'd think I'd have realized it by now, but it still managed to try to trip me every day.Oh--one note: free bottled water!

It‘s a nice Hotel next to the fun mile Clarke Quay.
Staff is professional and friendly as you would expect it in a Hotel like this.

Room:
Rooms are a bit small but as ground is expensive in this location of Singapore it‘s ok comparing to the rate.
Further rooms are clean and well equipped.
Only Point I did not like was the fact that the walls seemed to be thin as I heard the guy in the room next door snoring.

Breakfast:
It’s a huge Hotel so there‘s really a crowd of people on the breakfast Buffet.
Even tough there were so many people they had always enough clean tables available.
The buffet was always refilled as well.
Considering the flow of people going in and out during breakfast they really do a good job here(cleaning tables/ refilling Buffet)

Pool:
They have a nice pool on the roof.
Not outstanding but nice to cool down after a hot and sweaty day in the city.

Negatives: What really annoyed me was that some fellow guests put their bare food on the outside tables of the bar or let their toddlers walk on the table‘s during breakfast.
Others weared a t-shirt in the swimmingpool.
Possibly this behavior is quite common on the „subcontinent“.

At that point his former colleague came out while I was explaining to Larry. The other guy was very rude in vulgarity and was ready to challenge me for a fight when Larry stopped it. I apologise to Larry for my ignorance of parking the vehicle and at the same time I did ask his Colleague to apologise to me which he was very very rebellious about it.

The bathroom, tv, mobile phone, and bed are all working just fine. We love the pillows (soft or firm) and the bed was comfy same with pillows.

But the MRT and bus access means most places in Singapore are readily accessible.

Rooms are small, but very clean and well maintained. The rooftop pool is long (40 meters) and fairly narrow. It’s quite nice on warm, muggy days. Breakfast is very good, with the food choices changed each day, so it doesn’t get boring.

We loved the greenery around the hotel, the perfectly maintained and decorated interior and the delightful customer service we received from the Hotel Staff. From receptionists to restaurant staff everyone was super lovely and helpful.

The rooms were a tad small but I guess it is synonymous with how small Singapore is in general. Breakfast was a good variety catering to all preferences. Only drawback on breakfast though was the rather runny scrambled eggs with no other options for guests who have other preferences on eggs i.e fried, omelettes or boiled. It will be good for the Hotel to include an omelette bar if possible.

I absolutely loved Kim the waitress. She was super lovely and so attentive. Great member of staff

He goes out of his way to say good morning and not rush anyone. If anyone in the hotel deserves extra recognition it's him.

The hotel location is right in the heart of the vibrant bars and nightlife. It's also only a short walk from the bust designer shops of Orchard Road.
If you want a bit of a chill out then the roof pool and terrace gives you them few silent minutes.

Location is good. Only 10 minutes walk to Clarke Quauys and Chinatowns MRT´s. One morning it was raining and I did not want to walk to the MRT, so I took a cab. There was a smalll queue in the front of the hotel, but cab´s were arriving frequently and I was able depart within minutes.

Check in was fast and efficient. Room´s are bit small, but clean and maintained well. Wifi is pretty fast.

Hotel has a top floor pool, that I did not use. However it looks pretty cool overlooking to the Singapore downtown.

There are enough breakfast options and enough coffee machines, so you do not need to queue. Breakfast is ok as well. I tried indian breakfast options every morning and specially the curries are just awesome.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Excellent all round.  The Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay was our base for our first night in Singapore. From the moment we arrived, the warmth and helpfulness of the reception staff set this hotel apart from the ones I have stayed in, in the UK.

We were able to check in at 09:00 am. Very welcoming after a 14 hour long haul flight and although there were only twin rooms available, we needed somewhere to rest our head!

The room itself was very well appointed. 2 larger than average single beds, working space, free WiFi, fridge and plenty of space for our luggage. The room was quite clean. The only area that let it down was the sliding door from the bathroom into the bedroom. There was a quite a lot of dust present hence why I couldn’t give a rating of 5 stars.

The wet room simply fabulous with a conventional shower head and a waterfall shower head.

We ate breakfast on site. Fantastic choice which also catered for the more westernised palate, although I had the traditional Singapore savoury options. Extremely tasty and being a buffet style, you could have as much or as little as you wanted. Fresh pastries, fruits, an abundance of tea, coffee and fresh juices set you up for the day.

There is also a rooftop swimming pool and gym. Fabulous. With the most amazing views of the Singapore skyline. At night was simply a feast on the senses!

Just be aware though that the physical cost of refreshments within the hotel are quite expensive, so if you are looking to experience what the city has to offer it is most definitely worth taking a trip outside.

family,5.0,True,Positive,"Very nice stay in an updated boutique type hotel The stay at the Holiday Inn Express was very nice.  Breakfast was included and it was very nice every morning with an outdoor, cool setting despite the tropical conditions in Singapore.  Centrally located and near shops, restaurants and subway, all within walking distance from the hotel.  Great stay at the Holiday Inn Express.  The only drawback (minor) but still important to our stay -- there were no toiletries given!! No shampoo, no bars of soap, no lotions!  What was put in place instead were what I would call ""soap dispensers"" near the bathroom sink and in the shower!  This was just so unlike what a hotel should give their guests!  Every other hotel, whether 3 star and up would continue to give these amenities as they have always done.  I was really surprised that HI Express was not doing that.  When a family member stayed 2 years ago at the same hotel, all small amenities were given.  I would think that no one really wants to use a soap dispenser to wash up or wash their hair; it would have been much nicer if you kept the status quo like all other hotels and offered the bar soap, shampoo and lotion separately.  Other than that, the stay was very nice.  Staff was extremely accommodating and helpful.",2017-10-01,PreCovid,0

Handy to have a business centre and cafe available too.

The hotel is well located for Clarke Quay restaurants and bars as well as China Town. About a 25 minute walk to Raffles City.

Had a couple of very minor housekeeping issues during stay - toilet paper not replaced one day and shower screen not completely cleaned throughout stay, but these did not impact our stay negatively at all.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Convenient hotel for a few days sightseeing The HI Express is just that, a no frills hotel that is just fine for a few days stay in Singapore where you want to get out and about sightseeing. We arrived at 10.00 am although rooms aren't available until 14.00 but were offered our room ""early"" if we paid 65 Singapore dollars which is about £36. My Partner is a member of Holiday Inns so they waived the charge and we were given a room on the 3rd floor. There aren't any resident Porters so you have to take your luggage to your room yourself!

The room itself was a little small but perfectly adequate and had a nice unpretentious bathroom with a good shower. All the necessary toiletries were supplied as was a toothbrush and paste for any forgetful Guests. The room had a free safe, Coffee and Tea making facilities and enough hanging room in the wardrobe for a couple of days clothes. The room itself overlooked an inner courtyard so was a little dark but very clean, bed linen was spotless.

The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but does have a breakfast room where you can have a simple breakfast which is included in the price. They have a bar area and best of all a rooftop infinity pool, just perfect to unwind in after a hot humid afternoon sightseeing :-)

I would say this is a hotel for short stay tourists and Business people, very convenient for all major attractions. If you plan to stay 3 days plus in Singapore I'd look to pay a bit more and choose a hotel with more facilities.",2017-09-01,PreCovid,0

I had wine, expect to pay over £6 a glass and that's for Yellow tail. Wine and cocktails are dearer than UK, so Bintang beer is good.

business,4.0,True,Positive,"Incredibly functional - Very Singapore! I've now stayed at this location 4+ times in the last 24 months, and keep finding myself back here. It's a strange little oasis away from the bustle of Singapore.

Wifi: Always good (except in elevators). They even provide one of those local smartphones that can dial out, data out, but can't receive calls.

Room: These are tiny, even by Asian standards. The queen beds (never stayed in singles/two single rooms) are comfortable, and the slanted window-wall plus high ceilings make the rooms slightly less claustrophobic. My one gripe is the mounted liquid-soap+shampoo all-in-one dispenser. The one time I actually got a bar of soap, I was as excited as a kid at Christmas!

Food: Only ever had breakfast here. It's mechanically acceptable, never inedible.

Access: For this tucked away location, taxis are surprisingly plentiful. If you're heading to the CBD during rush hour, it may be advisable to ask staff to book you a taxi (at extra cost).

Staff: Everyone's been pleasant, from the front desk (probably over-the-top on some occasions to the point of being over-trained), to the aunties picking up your dirty dishes at breakfast (always with a genuine smile).

When we checked in we were early and I don't think they allow you to take your room early - which is ok - that is stated by the check in time. We went through the paperwork fairly easily and left our suitcases near the office. They do have a small cafe if you want to have a snack or something to drink - but it is very limited in choices. Better off to head out on the streets and find something. The room was not huge but clean - we had a inside room with no view - but as we were only there for one evening it didn't matter. The room was clean and neat - as it should be  - so we were very happy. I don't know if it is because we had an inside room but there was no road noise evident in our room . The best part of this hotel is the location - it is very close to the Quay and China Town - all about a 10 minute walk  each way. It has good restaurants at the Quay or if you want something more traditional there is always good food at China Town. Also there are a few pubs along the way if you want to wet your whistle. The amenities are good also - the pool area is quite nice  - although the water could be a little cooler - and there is a small gym next to it. At breakfast time it is a little congested getting your breakfast - you have a choice of indoor or al fresco - we opted for al fresco - the fans above were huge and kept the air circulating around you - which was nice and cool.

Rooms here are very small, but how often do you actually stay in your room, other than to sleep! They were well appointed, Queen bed, Flat screen TV, Tea/coffee and bottles of water supplied. Small bathroom with shower and toilet. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel and they also supply a free mobile phone for calls around the city.
Roof top Pool and fitness centre with views to Clarke Quay.
Restaurant serves a buffet breakfast in a real cafeteria style!
A small coffee bar serves coffees and snacks all day and the bar opens in the evening.
A short walk takes you to Clarke Quay or Chinatown, so eating out is no problem.

The power shower was exactly that, and worth a mention.
The rooftop infinity pool and jacuzzis are great for soaking up the views of the world famous Singapore skyline, only small disadvantage being there's no bar up there, however there is a rooftop gym for those who prefer the healthier option.
Breakfast was varied and you could eat as much as you wanted with ample seating inside or out.

Our booking for the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay Singapore was based on those previous experiences and we have been more than happy with our choice.

Reasonable room rates, great service, including me getting the departure date wrong and needing to add an extra night at the last minute. Yes, the rooms are compact, but fully functional with bar fridge, kettle, etc. Plenty of towels, just ask the friendly room staff for an extra one or two. Free bottled water helped keep us hydrated.

Comfortable bed, freshly made daily, a work desk, ironing board and iron. DIY Laundry with 3 washers and 3 dryers for SG$8.00 per cycle.

Buffet breakfast included in our package price meant we could have a solid meal before hitting the tourist spots for our short week away. Barista coffee shop \ bakery in the foyer, bar with snacks or light meals available as well. 7/11 less than 5 minutes on the same street for those last minute items.

Great location about 10 minutes walk to China Town MRT (rail / subway) and shops. 10 minutes in another direction put us on the other side of the river with dozens of bars and eateries. Taxis readily available if needed.

Swimming pool on the roof alongside a 24 hour gym room with various treadmills, steppers, etc, if you wanted that exercise. We did some 20,000 steps each day wandering and did not need the gym. Caution, the overcast Singapore sky still has high UV. Do not fall asleep in the sun beside the pool... (I was a very silly rock lobster).

business,5.0,True,Positive,"REVIEWS WRITTEN FOR TRAVELERS NOT OWNERS.... The Holiday Inn Express is a great value proposition near the Singapore CBD and night life of Clarke Quay.The property is modern and eco-friendly.   While the rooms are not spacious, they have everything a traveler needs from a queen size bed, black out curtains, rain fall shower, desk, Wifi, and a strong aircon!   The open air concept in the hallways and public areas is a nice touch.The best part of the hotel is the rooftop pool and gym.   The pool is at least 25m so good for relaxing and working out.  While the gym is open air and facing away from the morning sun.  The equipment is ok but not overly modern. Check in and check out were quick and seamless.  Rooms were cleaned before 12 noon.Lastly, there is a lot of open space inside and outside on the ground floor for catching up and dining.  The breakfast from 6-1030 was well thought out and provided a nice mix of hot and cold options.  Staff were attentive in the breakfast area. You are a 5-10 minute walk to Clarke Quay and a 5 min taxi to the CBD.  Not once did I have to wait for a taxi.  The Singapore bike share, O Bike, has a depot one block away which may be another option for moving around the city.

,4.0,True,Positive,3回目の宿泊 2016年5月11月に続いて3回目の宿泊です。 飽きが来たわけではないのですが、シンガポールにも慣れてきたし、たまにはホテルを変えようかなと思い、訪問先の同じ距離くらいのホテルを探しました。が、結局コスパを考えたところで、このホテルに落ち着きました。 決め手は施設が新しく、きれいなところ、朝食が含まれているところですかね。過去2回の宿泊で嫌な目に遭わなかったというのも大きな要因です。 さて、今回もチェックイン・アウトはすんなりと時間もかからず終了です。これはストレスがないですね。部屋も低層階でしたが、景色を見るわけでもなく、帰ってきたら日もすっかり落ちているので気になりませんでした。今回は2階に宿泊だったのですが、セキュリティがしっかりしているため（カードキーをつかわなければエレベーターが動かないアレです）、階段を使用できずエレベーターを待たなきゃいけないのがちょっとストレスでした。 しかし、このホテルはエレベーターが6基あるので、混雑時もそう待たずに乗ることができたのですがね。 今回、4泊のうち2夜帰ってきたらブラインドカーテンが壊れていて、フロントの方に修理をお願いしたのですが、気持ちよく受けてもらい、すぐに修理をしてもらいました。 朝食は豪華でもなく、質素でもない普通の朝食ですが、メニュー数も多いので不足はありません。ただし、朝７：３０を過ぎるとけっこう混雑するので、早めに食べたほうがゆっくり食べられるかなと思います。 前にも書きましたが、移動は便利ではないですが、ＭＲＴ Clark quay　駅から徒歩10分です。暑いしスーツケースを持って歩くにはやや遠いですが、観光などで移動するにはストレスのない距離です。今度新しくできる　MRTの「Fort Canning」駅からは少し近くなります。,2017-06-01,PreCovid,0

The rail station also seems to require one to negotiate some stairs, which makes hauling luggage difficult.  As to taxis, there are plenty.  The airport taxi is much cheaper during the day then at midnight (yes, what a surprise).  As to location to the main attractions, we were able to either walk or take the light-rail day and night without any problems.",2017-06-01,PreCovid,0

It was a great choice: very fast check in, good breakfast, very clean, good staff always available for any request and information. Room is small but you find in everything you need even a free mobile for local call and surf on the web plus free wifi and 2 free bottles of water every day. Swimming pool and Gym are at the roof. The pool isn't so large (4/5 metres) but is very long (40/50 metres) and after a day inside the amazing humidity of Singapore it's very pleasant to take a relaxing swim...  The hotel is located at 400m from the Clarke Quay subway station (exit Merchant road).

Just walk around the place and you can go anywhere! :)

Just keep in mind that it is an express hotel. So, you have to take your own luggage, no restaurants apart from breakfast buffet. But they do have a bakery shop, a bar and vending machines for snacks.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Awesome Stay at a great location This is a relatively new hotel in Clarke Quay, Singapore with a great location just a short walk away from some of the great bars and clubs where you can have an amazing nightlife. Chinatown MRT and Clarke Quay MRT are nearby, from where Sentosa and Bayfront (both of which are home to the leading sightseeing spots for tourists in Singapore) are merely around 2-3 stations away!
Regarding food, I'd say that being a vegetarian from India, the breakfast had limited options, which I found to be the one and only drawback of staying here.
Otherwise the hotel had all the amenities for a comfortable stay. The room size is compact, just like most of the properties in Singapore. However, the room has everything so beautifully arranged in such a way that one actually doesn't feel lack of space despite its small size. You also get a cellphone that you can use to make unlimited free calls internationally!

Breakfast are great with many options available, from eggs, bacon, to Asian noodles or rice, pastries, fruit, much more than anyone can consume. Perfect for starting any day.

The rooftop offers nice views of the area with plenty of lounging areas. A fitness centre, and a very long pool with the most interesting glass wall that allows you to look in, perfect to cool off in the sometimes steaming heat of Singapore.

This was our first stay at the hotel and chose it for its position at Clarke Quay - walking distance to the Sque Restaurant which we love as we do Singapore and to increase our Holiday Inn points which come in quite handy.
Reception was excellent and we got booked in very quickly although we were unaware that “Express” has no valet service – you had to lug your cases and find the room yourselves, which really was not a huge problem and presume if you were somewhat incapacitated they may help.
The room was on the 7th floor, the lift service was extremely good and the room was very nice and well appointed, the bed comfortable, very clean but extremely small, no problem for a couple of days but would not stay any longer only because of the lack of space but we still booked in for our return trip – same room and the young lady in reception was very helpful with the return booking.
Breakfast was very good, not a huge selection but what was there was adequate and free – and the eating area was very pleasant indeed.

Positive points;
1. Breakfast is limited but better than other holiday inn express standard. Must try croissant with local kaya. Stayed 3 nights, good menu rotation for their breakfast.
2. Room cleaning is outstanding compare to my previous experience with holiday inn express brand. Bravo!
3. Reception staff named Ning, she is helpful and friendly, not just only prepare room key but share about local experience, locations and how to operate the handy phone
4. Handy phone, I don't need to buy a SIM card, free hotspot, local call and also access to local attraction discount

Opportunities to improve;
1. Please don't check up the elevator at 10 am on Saturday, you know it is peak time after breakfast. Only 2 elevator operated, I know you have 6 in two sides so you can ignore this comment. Otherwise you will never allow staff to do so.
2. Repainted the ceiling at 10 pm on Friday night, funny enough for new opening hotel. On Friday, you repainted the ceiling and blocked one side of elevator. On Sat, checked up the elevator.

Yes, the rooms are on the small side, but we were comfortable with ten days’ worth of gear, they were kept clean, the Wi-Fi was great and the communal open spaces throughout the hotel are an amazing place to relax.

This hotel was perfect for our 2 night stay. It is a short walk to Clarke Quay.  Yes the rooms are small but they have are clean and tidy and how much time do you really spend in the room anyway.  It was great that breakfast is included and there was a good selection of food to choose from.  It was also nice to spend some time in the rooftop pool after a day out and about in Singapore.  The room rate is also very reasonable and the staff are very helpful.  We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Singapore; it is true value for money.,2017-04-01,PreCovid,0

Free self serve breakfast, standard large motel bain marie fare. Location is so close to so many great restaurants and bars of all price ranges they don't try to compete for lunch or dinner and the bar is very basic. Also has a small coffee shop next to reception.

Rooftop pool, spa and deck areas are vey nice but no bar bar and area could do with bigger or more shaded areas. My tip is walk a block to Seven Eleven and grab some beers, wine or whatever. There is a free ice machine and plastic ice buckets in the guest laundry on level 2 and they don't mind if you take your own drinks to the rooftop.Well stocked craft beer shop at Liang Shopping Centre just across the river if that's your tipple.

Free android mobile with I think 10Gb? of data to use in each room to use during your stay.

My room had aircon issues so they moved me to another room. Then the shower drain was blocked in the new room. When I asked for 5pm checkout on my day of departure, reception lady gave me a $40 discount for my room inconveniences.

Our arrival and check-in was smooth, handled by helpful staff, our booking accurate and our room was ready. After quickly freshening up we went to explore. Chinatown is only a 15 minute walk from the hotel. It was the back end of Chinese New Year so it was busy as expected. We headed for Clarke Quay for dinner. After our meal, during which there was some pretty heavy rain, we headed back to the hotel. We sat in the bar area with a couple of drinks before heading up. The staff working the bar were the same as those on reception, and they handled this role too with proficiently and helpfully.

We were awake very early, and were two of the first at breakfast at 6am the following morning. Breakfast is included, and was a better buffet spread than I was expecting.

Check-out was efficient and accurate, although we did have to wait in a queue for some minutes, clearly choosing a busy time for departing guests.

It is of average quality, but adequate for the needs of most. The main problem was finding a free table.

On the departure day, luggage and cakes had to store for few hours, the staff initiatively to keep those items separately, luggage was kept outdoor and cakes were kept indoor, thank you!

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Incredible architecture, Incredible roof-top pool, convenient location WOW! The only negative thing I can think of is the price, but everything is expensive in Singapore when you are used to BKK prices. I chose this place for the location as it's close to all the old parts of town.. for example, only 10 minute walk to Chinatown, and the 10 minute bus ride to Bugis Street passes by more classic buildings. It's also located near Clarke Quay, so the location offers an opportunity for a nice stroll along the river. I took the underground from the airport...and it's about a 7 minute walk from the underground through the station to the hotel.  Wonderful breakfast in a very open indoor or outdoor setting. The room seemed shockingly small, but upon investigation, everything was efficiently set up, and the food to ceiling window made the room seem much bigger.  The tiny room invited me to spend more time in the common area of the hotel and the streets of Singapore. The room includes a smart phone for guests to use...a novel, unusual and innovative concept! Very helpful staff...honestly, i cannot say enough positive things about this hotel.  Id choose it any day over a 5 star hotel. And across the street is the Central Perk...the cafe made famous in friends.  The cafe has non stop Friends on the TV as well as memorabilia from the show.  a fun place to relax.",2017-02-01,PreCovid,0

The rooftop pool was perfect for swimming lengths - 40m long and not too hot for exercising in.

The rooms were comfy and nicely done, but I would echo the other reviewers on the need for a proper door to the bathroom for soundproofing.

Breakfast had a wide selection, although I did miss the typical English fare of bacon, eggs and hash browns.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Great location  Really nice hotel, I can't fault the hotel at all the only thing I would say is the hotel rooms don't have balconies which we missed but I guess that's because it's more of a business hotel

WIFI - Great wifi all around the hotel and they even have two iMacs connected to a printer if needed

Rooms - The rooms are small but adequate for our needs with a nice shower and very comfy bed

Air con - The air con works great all around the hotel and in your room

Staff - Very friendly staff and very helpful with telling us where to go for the trains etc...

Breakfast - Great breakfast with lots of choice, they also have travel cups if you want a coffee to go

Smoking - If you smoke there is a smoking area on the 4th floor and also outside to the left, and at breakfast there is smoking tables right at the back on the left

Location - Great location for Clark Quay, however we though that Clark Quay was very over priced so we ended up eating and drinking in China Town which is just a short walk from the hotel as well

Pool - Nice pool on the roof that we used a couple of times

Gym - Great air conditioned gym on the roof

So over all I have to give it 5 stars as I can't fault the hotel at all, if I was coming to Singapore again on business I would definitely book here, however if I was here with my wife again we would probably book a more romantic hotel, hope this review was helpful",2017-01-01,PreCovid,0
family,4.0,True,Positive,"Solid 4 star hotel The Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay is the very definition of a 4/5 star property. Allow me to explain:

Pros:
+ Fantastic buffet breakfast. As in, I would encourage you to wake up early to go down, beat the crowds, and enjoy some really delicious food. They had fresh fruit, soy milk, congee, noodles etc.
+ Fantastic service at the breakfast. The ladies who were working were amazing. Running around to make sure it was as clean as possible, and really doing their best.
+ Rooftop pool, which was a nice little touch.
+ Very reasonable location, within walking distance to rapid transit. If you are in Singapore just for the Marina Bay area, this will be a little bit of a hike.

Cons:
- The rooms are cramped. Like New York City cramped. There isn't much wiggle room, so don't expect a lot of space.
- The bathroom has a sliding wall that opens up into the bedroom. Huh? Why would anyone, taking a poo, want to share that experience with the rest of the room?

All things considered, I would absolutely return to this property, and just make sure that when my wife is around, that I use the public bathrooms if I need to poo.",2017-02-01,PreCovid,0

Breakfast. buffet style was very good indeed. Great selection of food. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice pool on the rooftop. Only 1 metre deep all over and not very wide, but certainly adequate to swim in. Good other facilities on the rooftop as well.
The room itself- that was a different story. The hotel is almost like a square shape and the rooms face into the centre in the section we stayed in. Bit gloomy outlook, but not that important. rooms were adequate bit only gfot 1-2 night stays. Couldn't stay there a week. Double bed with not much room on one side and a bit more on the other, a stand for one suitcase. a table/chair, a small open wardrobe with ironing board and iron, a safe, tea and coffee facilities and a shower/toilet.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"A Solid Choice Singapore is pricey for hotels, especially with the taxes added on. We elected to stay somewhere cheaper here and at nicer hotels in KL & Bangkok where your pound goes further and gets more.

Well, we were surprised at the Holiday Inn Express. It was £90 a night (which is cheap for Singapore) but it was really good.

+ surprisingly nice roof top swimming pool and sunbathing area
+ very useful location, quiet but near Clarke Quay
+ $18 Singapore dollars from the airport by taxi, that's a heck of a great deal
+ everything is new and very clean
+ surprisingly interesting views from the hotel of downtown Singapore

Bad points
- Toilet is about 1m from your partners head if they are on the bed.
- Noise from the lifts and people talking if you get a badly located room (we got high floor but bad location and regretted this trade-off).
- Breakfast looked nice and was well stocked, lots of places for sitting and a good atmosphere but.... it didn't seem filling, kind of like a camping breakfast where you end up drinking a lot of tea and having an apple and yoghurt.

In conclusion, would suit people staying a night or two and who like clean, modern and functional hotels. Otherwise pay double and stay at the new JW Marriott that just opened.

family,3.0,True,Neutral,"Average hotel It is an average hotel with no frills et. al. For the same price one can stay at Novotel or Swissotel. Although the location is great, hotel fails in providing any hospitality.

I understand I have to carry my own luggage but their is no one to tell you where the trolley's are etc. They had staff outside but none told us and kept standing and chatting.

The rooms are really small even for one person although very clean and modern. If you have two suitcase to open then their is no space left in the room.

I do not see any point to all this cost cutting as no price benefit is transferred to the customer??? Having the handy phone was great.

The reception staff is clueless, if its in not in process even if you die they will not bother.

For the people with children this hotel is a no-no. We had trouble ordering hot milk that even an adult may order. We were sent from cafe shop to bar to cafe shop on the first day as if I had ordered uranium. From second day it was sorted but asking for milk was as if I asked them for their kidney- yes the reaction was that rude.

Being a business hotel they have no bottle sterilizer this is just FYI (we always carry ours). There was no dish washing facilities for bottles so please carry your own Pril, bottle cleaning brush, sterilizer etc.

For the breakfast same menu is repeated every day.

Overall it is an average hotel and not at all value for money and you get 0 hospitality. Hospitality is about making people feel comfortable and its not always by the book or process oriented step by step guide.",2016-12-01,PreCovid,0

You can call for free but can not take incoming call. Check in and out processes are fast.

business,4.0,True,Positive,"Good, clean, well-equipped, looked new-ish This is a good hotel located smack in a great location. Rooms and interiors are clean and updated, with my only complaint being that it is quite a smidge on the tiny side, maybe even a bit claustrophobic. But, it still is nice and cozy, and is good for a business traveller who doesnt have to spend much time in the room.

On one of the days I was there there was some rain, and the design of the building allowed us to enjoy the wet even from an inner room, but not without it's faults - some rain water splashed on the corridor, and it's a good thing the tiles were rough and not slippery, but I imagine a heavier downpour would have been a definite concern.

Breakfast was meh, but then again I wasn't there for breakfast, and it is a stone's throw away to Clarke Quay (a little touristy but still good if you want to watch people walk past and can only eat Western-style cuisine, i.e. not adventurous).Beside the hotel is a rather humdrum strip mall, with a couple of bars too but mainly catering to young expat teens with raging hormones groping each other on the sidewalk - if I'm not mistaken, there was a hidden superclub as well, but then again I digress.

A 7-eleven is nearby for your concerns, and a vendo machine in the lobby in place of a mini-bar.

The facilities like the swimming pool and bar downstairs is very good. The staff are also very friendly.
Rooms are clean and well laid out. Note more hotels in Singapore are smaller than else where in the world which was a surprise to us. But the room is for showering and sleeping as we spend most of the time out of the hotel exploring.

business,3.0,True,Neutral,"New place - Worth the stay if you are IHG member My review of this hotel is mixed. I had some minor issues, but almost everything I brought to the staff's attention was resolved.

Issue 1 - No hot water in shower: Resolved by showing me which way to turn the handle. Not sure if this really was the resolution, as I have stayed in many hotel rooms and always figured out how to get hot water, but I did not have any issue after Day 1.

Issue 2 - No maid service on Day 3: I returned to my room at 9:00pm to find my room had not been serviced. I was told by the desk clerk that I did not leave notice that I wanted my room serviced. WHAT? She said it would be taken care of and after I returned from a bar at Clarke Quay, I found my room clean and serviced! Very pleased.

Issue 3 - GNATS: I noticed a few gnats in the bathroom on night 1 but I was too tired to complain and it was only 3-4. After night 2 I mentioned to the front desk that there was a gnat problem. They sent housekeeping and I think they just cleaned the sink again because I did not see any when I returned from dinner, but they were back the next day. At this point I just decided there was something wrong with my room and I did not feel like asking for another room and moving all my stuff so I just dealt with it. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being extremely irritating, I rank this issue 3.

Now for the positives. The staff is really responsive and helpful. They always make it seem they are genuinely willing to help. The breakfast was easily the best part of my stay. Buffet style with plenty of options and all of them good. I would stay here again for the free breakfast alone. The WIFI is excellent and you can connect up to 4 devices. I love gadgets and this room had 2 that I was impressed with for a HI Exp. The alarm clock also served as a Bluetooth speaker. They also had a cell phone device dedicated to the room that served as a wifi hotspot once you left the hotel!! I have not seen this anywhere, much less a HI Exp!! It also served as a digital tour guide of Singapore. I did not use this device as I had a company phone I could use for data, and I am familiar with Singapore. The location is 1 block from Clarke Quay so there are plenty of dinner and drinking options within 5min walk. Did I mention the rooftop sky deck with pool and fitness center?

Overall I would stay here again...but I may try Orchard Rd just to have different dinner options. Cabs are fairly easy to get as well as Uber.",2016-10-01,PreCovid,0

We had a few drinks in the bar and sat in the outside area which was really lovely lots of comfy seating.

Breakfast had plenty of choice for a Holiday Inn Express, I have stayed in a few within UK and there is only a small choice available but this one had plenty of choice and you could go and sit in the outside seating as well as there being tables inside.

We also spent some time at the roof top pool and in the Jacuzzi which is really nice and they have sun loungers and towels up there for you to use.

The gym, like the rooms, was small but resourceful and the rooftop pool and area was awesome! I especially liked the fact the loungers weren't on top of each other and were fairly 'private'.

That said, the rooms are still really good and contain everything you could possibly want, although there's no minibar there's still a decent sized fridge to store your own drinks, has an iron and ironing board as standard in the wardrobe, lost count of how many 5* hotels I have stayed in where you have to call housekeeping for them.

But the bedroom as nice as it is it's rather on the small side with the bed pushed against the wall. Needless to say it's the side my husband needs to get in, so the wheelchair cannot be pushed down alongside of the bed, therefore it's a major struggle for him to get in at night and in the morning he manages to get partially across to my side then I need to pull him up.

The best part is that though it is well located, it was reasonably priced.  The hotel is suitable for both tourists and businessmen. Breakfast is adequate but with good quality food. We stayed there for 5 days the week before the Formula 1 race in Singapore.  We could see that some Formula 1 teams were staying there also.

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the hotel has good bar/restaurant area on the ground floor with seating both inside and outside. In common with a other hotels in Singapore in this price range, the rooms are quite small (but comfortable). However, one complete wall is floor to ceiling windows which makes the room feel larger. The view from the 5th floor was quite good. The pool on the roof is really great (long and thin but not deep - good for lengths) and has a glass side.",2015-11-01,PreCovid,0

All the rooms are similar size, and very small, the queen bed in a small room looks like a full size bed. Hotel it had many tour groups when I stayed there. So many people at free breakfast, many put a cup or glass on a table to save the seat and no seats are available outside. Frustrating.   Also, there is no complimentary parking in the car park, even though the car park is attached on sight with the hotel.  Parking is at prevailing rates and expensive. Overnight is $10 even with a $3.50 per entry fee bc prevailing rates start again at 6AM. Several hours can result in $15 parking fees.",2016-08-01,PreCovid,0

However not many hotels seem to have large rooms in Singapore.  Loads of natural light from the window, though beware as people can see in as easily as you can see out.  The reception staff we dealt with could not have been more helpful.  They were great with sorting rooms, storing luggage, assisting with other travel requirements etc.  All done with a smile.

My sister and I were able to find places for all of our things. We especially liked how they have a slot for the key to work the lights. You put the key in the light slot when you come it and take it out when you leave.  Within 30 seconds, the lights go out.  We loved, loved, loved the breakfast each morning.  The variety of foods were outstanding.  I was able to try many things I probably wouldn't have otherwise. There is a rooftop pool that is a lap pool, not a play pool.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Very Impressed We stayed here for two nights to break up the journey from the UK to Australia and were not disappointed with our choice. Our flight arrived at 4.55am, arriving at the hotel at 6.15. Reception advised that the room wasn't available, invited us to have breakfast (included in the room rate) and they would let us know when when the room was ready, which was 7.15am. Big tick here.

The room was not large but fine for two, clean, light and very comfortable; the bathroom small but adequate, good shower, tea and coffee facilities. The cafe appears to have recently changed hands and no longer has hot meals available at night although the in-house directory indicates otherwise. Breakfast for more than adequate.

We made use of the rooftop, taking a cuppa up there after a long day. Great view at night.

We had a late checkout of 12 midday, they were happy to store our cases until it was time to go to the airport.

Having had a bad hotel experience in Singapore previously, I am happy to recommend this hotel.",2016-07-01,PreCovid,0
solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Hard to find fault, excellent stay overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn Express, Clarke Quay. The location is decent, sitting on a relatively quiet Magazine street somewhat in between Clarke Quay and Chinatown and there's little else to gripe about. It ticks all the boxes that I look for in a hotel.

The hotel is relatively newish with a welcoming and modern facade. Aesthetics wise, it really echoes with what I like. Very pleasant, welcoming, and relaxing.

Checking in was a breeze. The staff was super attentive, and I was thanked easily 5 times for choosing the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay. Maybe too gracious that but not a bad fault. A room was ready so I got in early, which is always appreciated.

The room really exceeded my expectations. To put things in perspective, hotels in Singapore are pricy so often times I end up in cramped shoe boxes. The Holiday Inn Express may not be spacious but it's certainly roomy enough to be comfortable without feeling closed in. And the large windows and tall ceilings helped.

The room has everything I need from a really nifty safe deposit box in a drawer to a functional work desk which for once faces the window. TV has a good selection of channels and everything from lighting to the mugs were great :) small details I know but when most hotels are playing in the same price range, details matter.

The hotel also has one of those handy phones which gives you Internet access and free calls.

The hotel also has a great bathroom. Design works well, it's tight but you don't bump into stuff. Rain shower was nice too with good water pressure. I could have done without the sliding door that peeks into the room though - never quite understood those.

Breakfast was another surprise. The Holiday Inn Express Siam in Bangkok had a very functional breakfast. The spread at the Great Room in this hotel however had more than the bases covered with fruits, yogurt, hot meals, various pastries, drinks galore, and more. Not only filling, pretty balanced and quite a pleasant start to the day.

There's also a cafe in the hotel but it wasn't fully opened so didn't try anything.

One of the perks of the hotel is the amazing rooftop space where there's the excellent pool (great for laps), a small gym, and a garden. It's a wonderful space to escape to and enjoy Singapore from atop.

The rooftop also peeks into the rooms and the lobby downstairs. The hotel has an interesting open-air feel but it does mean that corridors aren't climate controlled.

PLUS:
Accessible location downtown though not as close to MRT stations as I would prefer, but still walkable.
Good bang for the buck.
Rooftop garden/pool is a major plus.

MINUS:
The bed was a bit firm for me, but that's a personal preference.",2016-06-01,PreCovid,0

For the price in Singapore you really won't find anything comparable; the rooftop pool is brilliant and the breakfast is pretty good with a basic selection.

As an IHG ambassador I was not expecting much in the way of special treatment as this was not an intercontinental but i was greeted by the duty manager and they readily agreed to extend my checkout to 4pm which was a sweet bonus!   The hotel also has a really modern design. The lobby, in particular, is very spacious and utilizes natural light and high ceilings very well.

The room was adequate with fantastic air-conditioning which is a nice relief for Singapore. There was no mini bar, but we knew that and got our supplies to fill the fridge with.  My favourite part of the hotel is the magnificent roof top pool area, to sit in the pool at night and see the lights of the city was magical. If you are a lap swimmer this pool is defiantly for you. Breakfast was included and adequate, however, there were lots of people trying to eat at the same time, so really busy!

It looks smart from the outside, but I feel the reception area is barely coping with the newcomers arriving when we come in.  However the young man attending to us is helpful and friendly.  Our standard queen room is quite small, and has a boring view out across an inner court.  It is probably advertised as 'quiet'!   It is unusual in shape with a very high ceiling, a small kitchen area, and a very poky en suite.  Nevertheless it is modern and smart.  The shower is luxurious with a large overhead rose, an easy control, and a moderate water flow.  I do prefer a cake of soap to the smart liquid sort provided!  Also no pampering shampoos, etc.  The bed is comfortable and there is excellent lighting.  No biscuits, and only two 'creamers' for tea and coffee is a bit stingy we think.  (Extras easily available from the breakfast room.)  The room has a small safe, a clock and a 40 inch television, a small desk area, and a hanging area for clothes with 'proper' hangers!  There is free wifi and plenty of power points.  Also a hair dryer, iron and ironing board.  We enjoy the extensive buffet breakfast and the friendliness of one of the waitresses in particular.  The dining area is large with a fountain and tropical foliage - very pleasant.  We can stay in our room until 12 on leaving day, and store our bags on leaving.  A trip up to the roof is worthwhile: views, pool, sundeck, and fitness room.  This hotel has a convenient location for exploring the river and accessing the cathedral, but perhaps not for other destinations.  Later comment ... .  We return a month later and are given a similar compact(!) queen room, but having a large sloping window with a very nice outwards looking view.  Makes such a difference to the feeling of the room.

I expected it to be basic, but we did have tooth brushes, slippers and bottled water.I liked the young lady at the front desk.  She was professional and upfront; clearly advising that this is not a full service hotel.  There's no room service or restaurant other than the morning breakfast.  To our pleasant surprise, we received our room keys early, before 10am and had a late check out at 2pm....at no extra cost being IHG members.  Nice.  More value.Btw, the breakfast was very good.  The food variety is changed daily.  And I liked the option of eating indoors or out.  There were a few long bar tables too.  This makes for easy conversations with other friendly guests.  Good coffee.The view from the roof was far reaching and garden flowers well kept.  The pool was very long and narrow.  We had a chuckle...it's only three feet deep.  But fun.We left our bags with the hotel and were given tags for later retrieval.  When we came back in the late afternoon, we were told to enter the storage area and identify our own bags.  There should be a better number/retrieval system.  Don't put the onus on the customer...maybe.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,"Clean rooms, friendly staff, great breakfast buffet Visited here on a business trip in June of 2015. It's fairly close to Singapore CBD. The building itself is nicely designed, the rooms were very clean, tidy, and comfortable. The weather was very hot, so the rooftop pool was much welcomed, even at 10-11pm, watching the laser light shows going on. And the breakfast buffet the next morning was once of the biggest and best I've had while staging at a hotel. And the staff were all very friendly. I would stay here again.",2015-07-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown, Clarke Quay and the CBD.

The building is new and modern. The rooms are slightly on the small side but comfortable with all the necessary amenities (wifi, tv, in room safe). The beds were quite comfortable.

The highlight of the hotel is the rooftop pool which offers great city views. The pool is a bit shallow for swimming but perfect for cooling off. There are also jacuzzis and a small fitness room.

The breakfast is included in the price but the dining room gets very crowded and the choices are quite basic.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,0

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Nice modern hotel in good location Stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay recently during our last night in Singapore. We arrived the hotel by taxi and went on to check in. After a couple of minutes of waiting, and a rather angry ”please wait in line sir” when approaching one of the (seemingly available) staff members, we were invited to approach by another staff member, that fortunately was quite the opposite in terms of attitude. The guy checking us in (I think his name was Sebastian) was extremely friendly, and immediately changed our initial slightly annoying experience to a very pleasant one. We were also given a late check-out next day since we had a late flight which was really convenient.

We were given a room on a higher floor (I think it was the sixth or similar) and with a very nice view over the CBD skyline in the distance as well as Marina Bay Sands in the even farther distance. The room was quite small but had everything that we needed with a flatscreen tv, WIFI, comfortable bed and bathroom with rain head shower.

Location is very good, a short walk from Clarke Quay with its bars and restaurants along the Singapore river. You can walk by the river all the way to the Marina Bay area with the giant Marina Bay Sands shopping center, Gardens by the Bay, and the other sights of that area. The CBD is also within quite easy walking distance. If you rather go with public transport the great MRT subway is close to the hotel as well.

We tried the breakfast our final morning and it was quite bland to be honest, but at least it was included in the room and there was a decent amount of different food options. It was also nice to be able to sit outside. On the hotel’s roof there is a swimming pool and fantastic views of the city in pretty much all directions. We also saw a gym but never used it.

Before checking out, we inquired about airport transfer, and the hotel booked an airport shuttle at a good price for the two of us that worked perfectly, with the driver sorting out what terminal we were actually going to, as we had misunderstood that.

The Holiday Inn Express’ general idea seems to be to offer good modern accomodation, at a good price, but without extra luxuries like someone carrying your bags to your room and without the ambience of a five star place. And as long at it is in fact at a good price, I really like the concept of these kind of hotels; good wifi, comfy bed and good location is pretty much what I need when abroad. A strong four, would stay again.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,0
couple,4.0,True,Positive,Couples getaway We arrived early morning at 9 am and were greeted with smiles. Since the hotel was on full occupancy the previous day there wetter no rooms for an early check-in but the staff worked at it and got us a room by 10.30am which is far better than having to wait till 2pm (regular check-in time). The rooms are a bit small but you wouldn't worry much about the size of the rooms afterall how much room will 2 people need specially when they intend on spending time out together. As all holiday inn express's go this one certainly fits the bill and certainly does justice to the brand. The rooftop pool area is a nice chilled out place to be during the evenings.. Breakfast is good and nothing amazing but again how much will a person eat to be fussy about variety.. The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to almost everything which is a plus point if you don't mind walking for 10min atleast.,2016-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,"Functional with few frills! This hotel is ideal for a short stopover and is well situated very close to the vibrant Clarke Quay and Chinatown. The rooms are compact but functional with free, reliable wifi. There is no restaurant though save for the standard buffet style breakfast in the morning and the bar is rather basic. Similarly, room service is a dial out option for delivery to reception which you would then have to collect. The rooftop sports a shallow and very narrow swimming pool but it is perfect for cooling off. There are also 2 side by side jacuzzis adjacent to the pool and a small indoor gym.

Everything works, is kept clean and, if you're a Premier League football fan, nigh on continuous re-runs of EPL matches run in the public areas. Don't expect an abundance of staff to cater for your every need but the staff that are there are efficient and professional.

In sum, this is a handy, short stay hotel, ideal for a business trip that doesn't require much client hosting. There is nothing wrong with anything as advertised, just don't expect to be blown away with additional services as they simply don't exist.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,0

business,4.0,True,Positive,"My new favourite hotel in Singapore Over the years, I have visited Singapore many times on business and on holiday and stayed at a number of the hotels the city has to offer. Unfortunately, not all of them have been pleasant experiences. The Holiday Inn Express at Clarke Quay, however, was a very pleasant experience - so much so, I would put this on the top of my list for my next visit.
For a start, the location is convenient for visitor attractions such as Clarke Quay, it is close enough to the excellent MRT system and the hotel was well served by taxis.
The hotel itself is modern, clean and bright. The air-con cool of the reception area was welcome after the Singapore heat and the reception staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful.
The room was not overly spacious, but then again, it wasn't that small either. There was only one of me on this occasion so the room was fine. The bed was comfortable, there was a desk and chair for working at and good enough hanging space.
I want to talk specifically now about the shower. Far too many hotels have showers that are simply not good enough. Either the water pressure is too weak or the shower head too low or the cubicle too small. This shower ticked all the boxes for me. This is important when you are visiting a hot and humid place.
The buffet breakfast was a pleasant surprise. It was fairly limited in what it offered but what it did offer, it did well and the staff were attentive at keeping the dishes filled.

All in all, a very pleasant stay.",2016-04-01,PreCovid,0

As it has a very good price-value-ratio, there are always quite a lot of guests, which you should consider in the morning, when you plan your time for breakfast.
On the roof-top, there is a pool, a gym and a few vending machines. The view is fantastic.

As I was there on business, and this is specifically a business hotel, not a great start. The mess did really allow the staff to shine as they........sent waves of technicians (who solved the issue by day 2) but then comped me drinks without me ever asking, repeatedly followed-up if there was anything else they could do for me and then were kind enough to comp my taxi to the airport upon departure.

Also the cleaner trying to come into the room at 8:30 the morning we are checking out (check out at 12) was quite annoying.

However upon arrival were told that there was only a room with two twins left. We were told that this was due to booking through a third party travel website rather than going direct.

I normally judge a hotel by the comfort of their beds and the showers. Both in this case are great. The breakfast varies enough that you never get totally bored. There are numerous restaurants of all shapes and sizes just a walk away and getting a cab should you require one is normally quick and efficient at this location.

Everything I needed was there, aircon worked very well, comfortable bed, choice of firm or soft pillows, excellent housekeeping. Free wifi in room worked really well. Hanging railing for clothing but no drawers. I didn't like the window set up. Window is one slanted glass sheet so it can't be opened, directly looks into building on opposite side of the street which means keeping blinds closed. Location was okay, quiet, but a little futher from the MRT than I would have liked. As a woman travelling on my own, I felt apprehensive walking through an isolated, dark area from the MRT back to the hotel at 10pm at night. Would definitely stay at Holiday Inn Express again but might look at different area. Breakfast was good lots of choice but not enough tables so three out of four mornings I had to sit on long bench type tables with other people. It doesn't have extras like room service, porter for luggage and concierge but that obviously helps keep the price down. The reception staff were great and helped me with directions etc. Vending machine for sandwiches, drinks etc and tea/coffee provided in room.

The first night I was placed in a room on the 3rd floor, near the elevators and overlooking the seating below. It was very noisy from people chatting into the early hours and walking to and from the elevators all hours of the night. The next morning, I was moved to a much better and quieter room on the backside of the 6th floor. As a bonus, they had blinds to fit the unique slanted window that were much better at keeping out light in the morning than the first room.

The room itself is good. It's small, but that's Singapore. I was out all day anyways. I found the bed to be a bit hard.

The breakfast is fine, with rotating daily selections, but since this is an 'express' hotel there's no room service or laundry. They do have a menu for FoodPanda, a food delivery service, in the room, which I thought was quite smart. I did order from them once.

Checkin area is a bit of a mess with no space on the counter to fill in your forms and as always takes too long but that's a curse of all hotels no matter where you go (why do you have to fill in email address and home address on these forms - surely all that information is already in the booking, especially if you are a IHG Priority memeber). Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. And the place is spotless. Easy access to the uber-priced restaurants of Clarke Quay and to the MRT to get somewhere else.",2016-01-01,PreCovid,0
couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Modern hotel close to everything We recently spent three nights in this hotel and found it to be a great choice. The rooms are small but we were so busy exploring Singapore that it was fine. We did find the doona was a little small for the size of the bed and the bathroom is very compact. The shower was lovely though with good pressure. The breakfast buffet was really good with lots of choices. This hotel does not have a restaurant for other meal times but you can purchase drinks ( tea, coffee, soft drinks and alcohol ) and snacks from the bar during the day. We found you had to wait at times as a staff member would have to come from reception to serve in the bar. The rooftop pool was fantastic. A very nice spot to cool down and take in the city views!! Loved it
There is a small gym on the roof too. This hotel also has a DIY laundry room which came in very handy. In the laundry there is a nice machine and ice buckets provided which was great for keeping your drinks cool poolside.
The hotel is just a short stroll from lots of restaurants along Clarke Quay and an easy 10 min walk to Chinatown. There is a train station close by which we found very easy to use and made our way around the city using this .
We would definitely consider this hotel for future visits to Singapore as it had a very relaxed feel and was ideal for a morning jog along the river.
All staff members that we dealt with we're very friendly and ready to help whenever we needed!!",2016-01-01,PreCovid,0

DIY laundry is functional and effective. The vending machine is also functional and provided.

couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Nice hotel but average stay Stayed here with my husband for 7 nights (26 Dec 15 - 2 Jan 16) and while its not the most spacious or convenient hotel, we still had an ""okay"" stay.

I booked this hotel based on the ""queen bed"" claim, however, the bed is very small for 2 adults. I did complain about this, and the lady at the front desk offered a room with a better view (as apparently all rooms have the same sized beds). While this didn't really solve the problem, I was impressed at the professional way she handled the situation (didn't catch her name, thought I think she had an Australian accent).
We also had an extra duvet organised for the room as the one already provided was tiny (probably in line with the tiny bed).

The breakfast options were plenty, however as we were there during a very busy period, we found it difficult to find a table to sit down on and had to skip the breakfast on a few occasions.

The pool is very nice, as is the gym. And the view from the roof of the Singapore city skyline is amazing!

All in all, we had an average stay (my only real complaint is the size of the ""queen bed"", but maybe Singapore has different sizing standards to Australia?"") and also the lady working on our last night who seemed to have an issue with me requesting a green tea bag which I found quite rude. I did however appreciate the free wifi provided.

Shower room again is considerably small but served fully whatever you need. I found bed and pillows are comfortable, you have two types of pillow - soft and firm.  They do not have room service, why do you need one when in Singapore, anyhow. But, they provide information of food delivery service you can call.

Kristina was amongst the best ones, always remembering your name even when she is handling so many people checking in/out at peak hour. Someone was always answering the phone when we called for anything from the room. They always address you with your name.

Breakfast was alright, nothing to shout about but decent. The way the tables were spread out didn't make us feel claustrophobic even when it was trawling with visitors.

Rooftop pool was beautiful with lots of trees and greens. Don't expect great views although you can see MBS from here. They also have a great jacuzzi.

There's not much stuff to see/walk to in the area but aunty's place as we called it (Brastagi Cafe if I recall the proper name correctly) was great! Food was affordable and really tasty!

AC was cold, which was nice but it does get too cold. They don't have room service so you do need to plan for dinner as the area is very quiet at night. The DIY laundry room was great for us and aunty Bette/Betty who was one of the staff taking care of it was so nice and helpful! She was amazing.

Would definitely come again. For the price you're paying for this place, you are getting more than what you pay for. I do hope they will keep the level of service high as this is very important and makes a lot of difference.

My only complaint would be the wifi. It was not great. Could do with some improvement for sure.

Other than that, well done!",2015-11-01,PreCovid,0

The worst part about this place, for it being a business hotel was the wifi- it was horrible. I didn't try the breakfast but my husband did and said it was decent.

The hotel is new and modern. Comfortable bed, no disturbing noise, and perfect temperature ensured excellent sleep quality. The room and the bathroom were nice and modern, and just big enough. A huge window covered the entire outward-facing wall. I particularly appreciated the rooftop garden and pool-area, which offers a great place to relax and a good view over the city. The breakfast area is pleasant, with possibilities for both outside and inside seating. There are different types of European and Asian dishes, in addition to basics such as cereals, fruit, and pastries. The selection is not large, but there is more than enough to have a good and healthy breakfast. I was a bit disappointed by the gym, which is very small and only allows for a rather limited selection exercises. Location is convenient with short walking distance to Clarke Quay and Chinatown.

On average they stayed for 2 nights, 30 Oct to 1 Nov 2015. They said that the breakfast spread was good, and that the rooms were small but comfortable and very well designed, with a lot of thought given to each part of the room's design. I checked out the rooms prior to booking them and I can concur that the room, though relatively small in size, looked very modern and clean and comfortable.

The hotel is also in a good location, and my overseas friends were able to make a short walk to one of the branches of the famous Jumbo Seafood restaurant in Riverside Point.

The hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating, and gave one of my friends the option to leave her luggage with the Concierge as she had a late flight after her check out, and even the option to freshen up at the hotel before her flight! She was very pleased with the service.

We had a room on the road so had a large window which at first was nice but once we read the sticker on the window and saw that people across the way or on the road could see in this soon became a pain as we need to keep the shades drawn. The room is well set out and clean and tidy, compact but okay for two - the bed is only a double which was a tight squeeze for us. The breakfast was free and okay, the roof was probably a highlight with nice garden, nice enough view and the pool was a plus.

But service was pretty much non existent which I must admit I missed. No one knows anything or can help you with anything. This showed thru when on the morning after checkin the fire alarm went off at 6am in the morning. We along with a host of house guests trooped down multiple flights of stairs in what felt like the dead of night only to come around the corner and be confronted with guests having breakfast and checking in. There would have been approx 100 house guests standing out side the hotel in various states of clothing and no one from the hotel spoke to us, explained, told us it was a false alarm nothing. One of the guests went inside and was told it was a false alarm. I know stuff happens but surely someone could have come and explained and apoligised or something. 6am is early when your on holiday!

Rooftop pool is a long narrow 40m pool. Very good for lap swimming so long as not more than 2 people in the pool (conversely, not great for swimming if there are some people lounging in the pool getting in the way).

The most annoying feature and ultimately the reason I changed hotels, was the car park charges and the fact there is an ERP outside the hotel. Drivers choose another hotel. If you park for the weekend expect a big charge on the NETS card. The last nasty surprise was due to checking out earlier than planned, Got hit with a MASSIVE charge, the equivalent of 4 nights stay. Maybe I should have given them prior notice but I doubt it would have made a difference. In short when I return to SG in a few weeks time I'll not be checking in here.",2015-08-01,PreCovid,0

Ceilings have to be at least 15ft in height, so therefore the room feels quite condensed.  A very strange feature is the panel which moves across so that the bathroom and shower are fully exposed to all.   Very bad positioning of towels hanging directly on rails above the toilet.  Housekeeping was slack in that the bedside tables and desk were not wiped down after our first night.  Staff were very pleasant and we were able to access the roof top after checking out of our room at 2.00pm until we were picked up at 5.00pm to be driven to the airport.Very comfortable bed, but could have done with another chair to sit in.  Sitting on the bed is awkward and did nothing to ease my back.Breakfast was plentiful with a huge selection of pastries, and the usual buffet spread.  But can't a hotel be Halal friendly and serve pork products as well?  I should have thought that in an international city such as Singapore and particularly, an international hotel group, this would not be a problem, and that all tastes should be catered to.  After all, just because pork is available, it is not mandatory to eat it.Found the air conditioning to be very cold, if fact we had to turn off our a/c as we could not turn it down.",2015-08-01,PreCovid,0

Upon arriving at the hotel, the tall and high ceilings and the natural earthy colors used was very inviting. You will just tell yourself that this is going to be a nice hotel to stay in.

The room is not very BIG but it’s cosy enough with sufficient space to move around and the high ceiling helps to make the room looks more spacious :)

The Clarke Quay hotel is bigger overall, and I like that there is a sort of central atrium on the guest floors which gives a resort feel.   Having read the other reviews, I told myself that I will not comment that the rooms are small, as I am familiar with HI Express, but I cannot tell a lie -- the rooms are indeed small.   BUT they are well laid-out.   The bathroom is super compact and I suspect a larger person will have problems with it, but it was okay by me.   My only other comment for the rooms are they need more places to hang clothes.  The closet is big but only one hanger rack, so there is plenty of space on the sides.   Installing 2 clothes hooks will do wonders.We requested a twin room, but were given a queen room the first night as they were full.  But the staff were quick to assure us that we would have a twin room the next day, and we did.   It was a painless process and very thankful to all at the front desk for it.

It was a pleasant experience staying in Holiday Inn Express Singapore clarke quay. They have our essential needs with a reasonable price (approximately 190sgd/room/night) and we have everything we need: good bed, good shower, good breakfast, and good location nearby Clarku Quay MRT and both Singapore River and Chinatown.

The hotel is just a 7-10 minutes stroll from the MRT, so it is really convenient.

However, due to the price we pay, do not expect too many varieties on the breafast. They just have them right, not abundant :) But i would reccomend you to go to mini market first and buy your needs (drinks or snacks) before coming back to the hotel since there was no mini market accross the hotel.

The room came with free breakfast. Selection of food was quite limited but there was oatmeal and bread. The eggs came in a choice of scrambled or hard boiled.

Very impressed with the place as we had this expectation that it'll be a 'budget' version of the usual Holiday Inn Hotels.

Love the facade and the design of the whole building! Very modern and trendy. Free breakfast and wifi were provided. Breakfast was not bad with quite a few options to choose from. One small complaint is the seating provided. There were not enough places to sit :( Had to wait every morning. Not an early riser so we usually go around 9.15 am and it's full.

We didn't find any convenience store nearby and the nearest was at Clarke Quay itself and that one was REALLY small. Didn't sell normal bottled water except the premier brands. The vending machine in the laundry area didn't have any bottled water as well. Only packet drinks and carbonated water.

Being a new building the décor was very modern. The location of the Hotel is more Boat Quay than Clarkes Quay and set a 15 minute walk from the River. A quiet area so advisable to order taxis through the very helpful concierge team.",2014-12-01,PreCovid,0
couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Relatively new hotel near Clarke Quay My wife and I stayed three nights on a short stay in Singapore.  Found this hotel to be reasonably priced for a new hotel that was very clean and tidy.  Good friendly service at the front desk and at the morning breakfast.  Thought the breakfast buffet was pretty good with a selection of fruit, breads and hot dishes that changed slightly every day.  The rooftop pool was fun and the glass sides make it interesting.  The spa pool was out of service while we were stere so we couldnt give the place five stars.  Rooms are small but new and clean.  No complaints as long as you dont spend a lot of time in your room.  Soft and hard pillows provided but they both felt hard.   It is a 10 minute walk to the hotel from the Clarke Quay MRT with one set of stairs to traverse so keep that in mind if you have bags.  From the time we checked out of the hotel, walked to the MRT, rode the MRT to the airport to the time we were through customs at Changi Aiport was 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Cost $5 for two of us on the MRT.  In a very expensive city we thought this was a pretty good deal. All in all a good place to stay.",2015-05-01,PreCovid,0

couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Small and acceptable. If you are staying alone The hotel is near boat quay and the nearest mrt station is clark quay, which is abt a 15-min walk. The hotel vicinity is quiet in the day, most probably comes alive at night. Or not. It’s not located next to boat quay, so for those who are easily bothered by noise and drunk party-goers at night should find this hotel acceptable.

As for the room, it’s small, tiny. Cozy, if you were to put it nicely. We did some research online prior to booking the hotel, hence, we were prepared for the size of the room. The bathroom is small too, though you will find all the necessary amenities included.

Bed is comfy, nothing extraordinary, aircon works ok.

The corridors of the rooms make use of open concept and I m not that crazy abt it. The corridors are also not as wide, so the rooms are actually quite close beside and opposite one another. The heavy doors do block out some noises of talking guests, slamming doors, footsteps etc, but maybe not all since the rooms are small, noises from outside can be heard easily. But it was quite peaceful during our stay there.

Nothing fancy for breakfast. Just breakfast staples like hot beverages, cereals, fruits and porridge.

Checking out is also a breeze.

The location of the hotel is a walking distance away from two MRT stations, Clark Quay and Robertson Quay but still it is located in a quite part of Singapore so a good night rest is almost guaranteed.

The rooms of the hotel and the beds are not large, but they are well equipped and comfortable. The service given by the friendly staff is excellent. The breakfast is free and the music is a little too loud. The atmosphere in the lobby area (including outdoor seating) is great and relaxing. The roof with its pool is awesome and a great place to relax and cool down.

Hotel is perfect. One tip, if you don't know how to turn of the light in the bathroom....its the button at the entrance next just below the main switch which you activate with your key. It has a little shower as a icon.",2015-04-01,PreCovid,0

Arrived in the evening. Our room was ready. The entire hotel was spotless clean. Singapore is already a very very clean city and this hotel did not disappoint either. Rooms are on the cozy side but we just needed a place to sleep and shower.
Wifi - fast, great
free breakfast - many options to choose from. Being a vegetarian, I was still able to eat plenty.

location - very well located in a quiet part of Singapore. The train station is about 10 mins walk (Chinatown). Taxis are always available if you need to go anywhere anytime of the day or night.

Airport shuttle - I did not know about the airport shuttle but for $18 they will take 2 people to the airport at any time you need. So please use this service. The taxi will set you back about $30-35 depending on traffic. We used the shuttle on the way back.

Staff- very friendly, always there to help you. It can get busy at the front desk so if you have a lot of questions it may be a good idea to come back when it isnt busy. I saw it the busiest in the morning time.

tip- When coming back to this hotel at night, some taxi drivers have a hard time finding it. So use the address or nearest mall for reference. But you can't miss this hotel. Its not small.

This hotel has a lot going for it. The positives of this hotel are

-Great location- close to 2 MRT stations and even able to walk to most things if you can handle the heat.

-Amazing Staff- A hotels can be great but it is nothing if that staff are not willing to go the extra mile when they are able too. All of the staff are friendly but 2 of them stood out to me . Firstly at check inn as I was a gold member they allowed me to check in at 9 in the morning which is exactly what i needed after a 11 hour flight. The room I had requested was not ready so no problem they moved me to another one, although not what I wanted was happy to take this to check in so early.Secondly as I was leaving the room attendant that found something that was left in the room and ran after me, would had been easy to just forget about it.

-Breakfast- Great to see so much effort put into breakfast here with Asian and European options. You could eat enough to last to dinner and great options of where you could eat both inside or out.

-Roof Top- If you stay here make sure you check out the rooftop pool and view

-Design- Modern hotel that has been designed with nature in mind.

Of course there is room for improvement and some of these are

-Towels- One of the towels left in my room had a massive hole in it.

-Rooms- The rooms are well designed but if you get an inward facing room it will not be the best view or any view at all . Request an outward facing room. Also the rooms are small.

To sum up the hotel is new and clean and I would stay here again for sure. The rooms are small and you expect that in fact you get more than you would expect from a Holiday Inn Express.",2015-04-01,PreCovid,0

So there’s no bell boy to meet us at the front (reminding ourselves that it is a budget hotel). Did we get a decent “welcome greeting”- not really. Pay the amount owing from booking.com (which ended up being AUD$60 more- what’s with that??), given our keys and told us where the elevator was (again, reminding ourselves that this was a Singaporean budget hotel).. We were told that this hotel is central to most of the attractions but don’t forget Singapore is such a small island.

Check in was a breeze in a very welcoming foyer.  Decor really surprised me - very modern, eclectic and clean.  Three lifts service all floors - very efficient. My room was on level two facing over the front of the hotel towards Clarke Quay.  Yes, although everything was new, clean and well equipped, storage is a slight issue and no drawers for popping your clothes in.  The bathroom was lovely and the shower had great pressure.  There's a room safe and the usual (well replenished on a daily basis) tea/coffee making facilities.  The guest laundry was just at the end of my corridor... very well equipped, but I felt it was a little expensive for a paying guest.  The rooftop pool is gorgeous...  glassed sides to affinity.  The garden area/seating area is beautiful.Breakfast was free!  Beautiful seating areas/separate smoking area.. with up to date tables/chairs/loungers.  There was plenty of sliced tropical fruit/whole fruit, yoghurts, hot options with eggs, beans, noodles, and both western/malaysian options available.  Also pastries and small rolls with the usual condiments.Having no option but to re-register on a daily basis, I found the front desk staff delightful and very helpful to me.  Even the concierge asked of my husband's progress on a daily basis.  Taxi's are plentiful and cheap and in the evenings it was safe enough for me to walk around to the local ""mall"" and eat very healthily in the food halls (plenty around near the hotel).Once discharged, it was great to share the room and let the staff finally meet the other half of our booking.  Hubby's experience at the hotel echoes mine.. but his comment was that the room size would be excellent for one... should be bigger for two if you are wanting to settle in for a week.This hotel will do very well.

Was surprised they had a good breakfast spread for HI express. The staff during breakfast were quite nice. Room was a bit small and so was the bathroom. Definitely fits only 2 adults for standard room. Has a laundry room - 8SGD a load. The laundry room also had ironing boards. The view from the room might not be fantastic but go up to the roof where the pool is and you get a good view of the goings-on at Clarke Quay. The MRT is within walking distance and it is easy to get a cab in the mornings. Food is not a problem as it is next to Clarke Quay.

The bad
The bathroom had a stench and it didn't go away after house keeping. Could be the rubber mat. The hot water was really inconsistent. From relaxingly warm to scalding hot frequently. The sound insulation wasn't so good and I could hear conversations from the walkway.

A pricey hotel for HI express but I suppose the location justifies it. Ask for rooms nearer Clarke Quay and you might get a nicer view.",2015-03-01,PreCovid,0
couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"A little disappointed I stayed here with my husband on 24 th March for one night as part of our honeymoon. We arrived at the hotel via underground (quick, easy and cheap) getting off at Clark quay. We then got a taxi to the hotel (don't bother - it is so close, save your money!).
The welcome wasn't particularly inspiring. My husband and I struggled to get our backpacking bags out of the taxi and settle the taxi bill whilst staff members watched on. Not a great start really.
We checked in but the staff didn't really seem to know much about anything, I asked some questions about the night zoo for example but the receptionist didn't know. Fair enough, I don't expect anyone to be an encyclopaedia of knowledge but maybe she could have made more effort such as asking a colleague?
When we got to our room (still struggling to carry our bags...) I was a little disappointed. I had made the booking 6 months prior and asked for a room on a high floor with a good view if this was possible. We purchased just the standard room but I was aware that the standard rooms were also on higher floors . We were put in a room on the 3rd floor, but the room was nice enough. It was clean and modern but there seemed to be an issue with flies on the bathroom ceiling which I reported to a member of staff.
My husband and I decided to go out for some local food so we asked the door man for some tips. He was really helpful and helped us jump into a taxi and told the taxi where to go. Unfortunately when the taxi dropped us off we realised my husband had left his phone in the taxi. We made our way back to the hotel to try and track the taxi/phone down.
We explained what had happened to the receptionist and asked if she could get the doorman whom had helped us (in case he remembered which taxi driver/company etc) she said she didn't know who or where he was. I asked a security guard who said he would be back in 15 mins. Long story short we got the phone back and all staff helped to do this and obviously we we're grately relieved but reception just seemed a bit useless throughout our stay.

Breakfast was nice enough, chicken sausages, noodles, scrambled eggs, breads, cereal, Juice, pastries. All nice and edible enough, nothing special really.

All in all our stay was ok. The hotel looks amazing, great location and the roof top area was impressive, the rooms were average and the services and efforts by a few staff was disappointing.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Book with confidence Having read several recent reviews on this hotel I have got to say the contributors have described this hotel perfectly. If you are looking for a pre-cruise or general stopover location in Singapore then look no further.

I agree that the small but clean and modern rooms did cause us logistical problems with all our luggage and a two week stay might have ended in divorce for my wife and I.

The only thing I can add to the previous excellent reviews is that the location is ideal. We ate at Boat Quay and Clarke Quay both nights and it took us no more than ten minutes to walk back to our hotel. Chinatown was also no more than a ten minute work. The magnificent Orchard Road shopping street required a short taxi ride as did Little India but what you need at nighttime are bars and restaurants on your doorstep and this location fits the bill.

On our return from our cruise we had nearly a full day to see the city again and we got a taxi back to the hotel who looked after our luggage so we could wander around on our last day at leisure. We returned to the hotel and the Receptionist give us a keycard so we could access the rooftop area with our drinks prior to our taxi arriving.

Others have described the hotel quite adequately. What I particularly liked:
--every staff member was friendly and helpful
--rooftop pool and gardens are a pleasant place to recharge after a day of sightseeing.
--while the breakfast selections were somewhat redundant they varied the variety of chicken sausage and noodles each day.

A few tips:
--taxis: if you are only here for a few days don't bother trying to figure out the MRT/bus. Taxis are so cheap that it well worth the cost for the convenience.
--sQue is a restaurant/bar on the hotel side of the river a short walk away. During the 11A-7P happy hour, pints of cold Singha are 2 for $16S. With nice river views, another great way to refresh.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Small rooms Big Heart! Worth the booking. We wouldn't typically book at a Holiday Inn but took a chance because this one is very new. A risk worth taking. Yes I agree with the compact room size, there's barely room to lay open your suitcase other than on the bed if it's a hard case like mine. There is a stand that works for a traditional case. The bathroom is also tiny but the shower is pretty great with both a hand shower and a rain head, both with good water pressure.

The plusses make up for small size, brilliantly. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Even bussing staff at breakfast smile and thank us as we leave. We especially loved the included breakfast. The dining area part inside part outdoor garden and fully secluded from the quiet street beyond. Love the small gym… totally adequate with towels and water… view of neighbouring buildings from the rooftop and never had to wait for equipment. The pool water was a bit cooler than expected but refreshing and also awesome. There's plenty of rooftop for walking around the trees and lounging as well. The bed is comfortable and there are soft and firm pillows clearly marked. There's a pretty big Samsung TV built into the wall and a desk by the windows so you can work with a view. All amenities and yes free wifi! thank you.

The location is amazing very close walk to Clarke's Quay. Fab after dark especially. Clarke's Quay is the best area we've seen here with lots of restaurants to choose from all around the river and lit up beautifully at night. Be prepared for some pretty hefty bar bills in the area. There's a high tax on liquor and the price of drinks is high. Most places don't sell wine by the glass and if they do, the lowest price is about $14-16. This surprised us.

We were pleased to have access to their laundry room but beware, each wash and dry costs $8! We used it for convenience and appreciated the plastic hangers available to hang dry items.

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Well planned, efficient, well-managed hotel We stayed for 3 nights at Holiday Inn Express. It provides an excellent value with space-saving measures. The halls are narrow, and the maids' carts are half-sized vehicles, each maid bringing one for supplies and the other for used towels. The room is larger than at the Ibis Bencoolen, which is our Singapore Hotel standard, with a number of universal electrical outlets. There was comfortably enough room for us and two very large suitcases. In the bathroom, there are both rain shower and hand-shower heads. There is a hand spray by the toilet. I forgot my toothbrush, and I found they provide a good toothbrush (which was replaced the next day by the maid). They have a night light in the bathroom. The TV offerings included Fox Premium Movies.

The policy of allowing free Wi-Fi for up to 4 devices at one time is quite reasonable and convenient because you don't have to log in every time you go on line. You have to remember, though, that, even though it is turned off, each device is considered ""on"" until you log it out. Wi-Fi keeps you logged in until your check-out date.

Because we were Gold Ambassador members, they provided us with a 15% discount at the bar, newspaper, possible late check-out, and the opportunity to choose a room or to take the room that was assigned to us. The room assigned to us was on the Clemenceau Road side with slanted windows and a view of an apartment building across the street. The entire ground floor seems devoted to the reception area and the breakfast room. The buffet breakfast consists of scrambled and boiled eggs, cereal, and cold pastries--croissants, mini-Danish, rolls. Fresh watermelon, lengkeng, bananas, yoghurt. It was quite enough to fill us up. Choice of eating inside or outside. Even when the hour was near closing at 10:30 am, there still were tables available.

We still prefer the Orchard and Bugis Street areas for shopping, but Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, and Robinson Quay are worth seeing, especially in the evening. If you decide to stay at Holiday inn Express Clarke Quay, here are some tips:

- As far as we can see, the views are about the same whether you are on the Clemenceau or the Magazine Road side. Higher rooms are less noisy. We had no problem with traffic or neighbor noise, but it is true that groups often chat loudly when they are passing in the hall. The door is very thick.

- This is a popular hotel. Best to reserve in advance.

- Usually easy to get a taxi but leave 10-15 minutes for getting a taxi at off hours.

- When the elevators arrive, there are no bells--just a light by the door a moment before the elevator arrives, so you have to keep your eye on all three elevators

The hotel looked brand new. Everything worked. We feel the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay is an excellent value.",2015-02-01,PreCovid,0

Brought my GF for a Valentine's staycation at the hotel, I must say I am presently surprised with the service staff, the moment I walked in and did my check-in, and they even promptly agreed to my requests of a high floor and late check-out!

Upon entering the room, we were simply and completely satisfied with the cosiness and interior of the room (no weird smells or any sorts of that negativities), a really cool interior and design of the bathroom that consists of a rain-shower, as well as a good variety of channels available on the TV, which should cater to anyone and everyone (sports, fashion, variety shows, movies, Chinese Mandarin, English, news etc)

Am also really 'wowed' by the unique and beauty of the swimming pool and jacuzzi on the roof, giving it a 'human fish tank' look and feel, alongside the length of the pool which is equivalent to a lap in a normal swimming pool! The fact that the jacuzzi (2 jacuzzis) lasts approximately 15 mins for each time you start on it is a plus, so as limit hogging, and also notification for the user to get up.

The gym also boasts of sufficient treadmills and cycle machines, with the appropriate dumb-bells and range of weights available, as well as a multi-purpose machine (cross-cables etc) which is nicely done with music, water dispenser, towels, as well as a TV to complete the small, but really useful gym!

Could rate it as a ""5 Star express hotel"" Location is not too bad, 10 -15 min walking distance to Chinatown or Clarke Quay. Taxi to zone of Marina Centre is about 10 - 15 min ride during office peak hours in the morning. Rooms are a bit small if you are sharing with another person. Toilets is also very small. However, only bad experience during my stay was that the service at the alfresco cafe was very slow. I walked in to this place at about 10pm for a few beers. The waiter at the bar saw us as we took out seats outside but he never came to take our order immediately. Waited for a good 10 minutes until I had to walk over to the bar to get my drink ordered. Later I ordered another round of drinks...same had to walk to the bar area but there was no one at the bar. Waited for quite some time before someone came out.

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Great Location, Great Value It's tough to say what is best about this hotel, so I'll start with location.  It's a 10-minute walk from Chinatown, a 10-minute walk from Robertson Quay, and a 10-minute walk from Clarke Quay.  And, it's a 10-minute walk to the Northeast line on the MRT.  But more, the hotel offers the best of the basics.  It's clean, stylish, and the staff is extra-friendly.  The beds are comfortable, and you have a choice of soft and firm pillows.  Also, the hotel is very well acoustically insulated.  You really don't hear the other guests unless they are literally screaming their lungs out next door.  Many might think the room is small, but I'm usually exploring all day, come back for a quick nap, then head out for the evening, so size isn't important to me.  That said, I would have liked more space to hang my clothes.Things to look out for:  There is a Do Not Disturb light next to the door.  If you don't turn off that light, your room won't get cleaned.  You can turn it on and off using the red bell button next to the door, but only if your key card is in the slot above it.  Also, there is a nightlight under the bathroom sink.  You can turn it off by pressing the crescent moon symbol next to the bed.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.  It's a really great value for the money.",2015-02-01,PreCovid,0
couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Lovely Hotel in Good Location Good welcome from reception. Room is small for two and like many we’ve been in these last six weeks, though it’s a room for two there’s only one suitcase stand and only one chair.

There's a kettle but the tea & coffee supplies are not refreshed by the maid tho' reception will happily hand you more. Two complimentary bottles of water are supplied each day and there’s a quiet fridge to keep them in.

The ceiling is very high, unusual in a modern hotel.

The bathroom has had the benefit of a ‘designer’ ..... Thus the floor-to-ceiling mirror behind the washbasin slides aside to provide an opening so your partner can see you shower and do all the other things people usually do in the privacy of an old-fashioned bathroom. Keep it closed but the sliding panel has gaps so that at night light leaks out to the bedroom when someone uses the bathroom.

The door to the bath room is also a slider which once it comes off its runner — which it does when it is opened, can only be lifted back by someone stronger than me. We had an engineer to fix the aair-con who repleced the door, but as soon as he left then it came off so the door doesn’t close flush and radiates light.

I’ve stayed in countless hotels including many IHG ones. Basically bathroom doors don’t need redesigning and — although I maybe a lone voice here — open plan bathrooms are not the way ahead.

Good shower with two of them in the glass compartment. One huge fixed very high, thanks to that high ceiling and a lower hand held one. No set of toiletries, just soap dispenser fixed to wall, but good towels.

Having slammed the design of the bathroom, the rest of hotel is rather well done. Rooms open out to a walkway around an atrium which is open at the top so basically you are in fresh air when you step out.

There’s a large rooftop garden with lush greenery, seating and a very long narrow pool that sits 1 metre high with a glass wall that runs its length at the edge.

From the garden you can see Clarke Quay which is about a 5-15 minute walk depending on your energy level in the heat.

Breakfast, which is included, is on the ground floor. Self service buffet with hot and cold food including chicken sausage and scrambled eggs, asian noodles and fried rice, assortment of breads and pastries, juices local fruits, bananas and apples. Several serving stations.

You can sit inside or out, under cover, on tables or sofas and a busy team will clear away dishes and keep everything clean. This was excellent.

Internet service is free, fuss free, fast and unlimited but only 4 devices can be attached. (between us we have 2 notepad computers, 2 Kindles, 2 smart phones, 1 tablet......)

Good security; only the ground floor button on the lifts can be selected without a room key.

Room keys are contactless, but — darn it — you have to stick one in a box in the room to get power. Mrs P need to charge up her phone while we sit in the roof garden, so she has to leave her key in the room box or the phone doesn’t charge. Later when she wants to go down to the room to shower she has to take my key. Now I cannot get down to the floor our room is on. So she has to go down, retrieve her card, come back up and give me back my card, before going down again. These things are a massive irritation.

So, tho’ I’m a fan of Holiday Inns, and there is much I like about this modern hotel I don’t think the room is up to their usual high standard.

But we would return on our next visit to Singapore",2015-01-01,PreCovid,0

business,4.0,True,Positive,"Modern, clean, well positioned ... This is a new hotel and not to be confused with (I think) three other Holiday Inn hotels in the area.  If you don't wish to use the MRT I paid S$26 from the airport in a taxi.It is exactly what you would expect from a modern international hotel.  Check in was quick and efficient, the room was modern and well designed with a vertiginous floor to ceiling window that leans out from the floor affording excellent views of the area.  The lifts were fast and efficient and required a swipe of your room key for added security.Breakfast was fine, with both Asian and European breakfasts available, though the cooked version  steered clear of pork products.  Excellent coffee.  Food in the evening, however, was extremely limited (baguettes and pot noodles) but there are so many good places to eat within walking distance this hardly mattered.The bar was a tad expensive, S$12 for a can of Tiger beer but, again, there are plenty of alternatives a short stroll away.  If you are pressed for time or don't wish to wander very far I recommend a trip to Alchemy directly opposite the hotel.  They have a menu for an inexpensive local restaurant that you can order from and are happy for you to consume that on the premises.  Of course, the hotel is ideally located for Clarke Quay and also for Chinatown.  For anything further afield I found the taxis were very inexpensive. There is a small gym on the roof of the hotel and a pool that is arm span wide but nearly as long as the hotel if you have time for a dip.  There you will also find chairs and loungers to relax on.  For those travelling on business this (the roof) was the one area of the hotel where the wifi struggled to perform.  Otherwise it was excellent (and free).Clean, efficient ...

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Near perfect stay Everything about my stay at this place went well. I booked in advance direct with Holiday Inn online (which had the best price). Hotels in Singapore are not cheap but this one offers good value for its location and facilities.

Through the pre-check-in option, I got a nice room on the 5th floor with a view. The rooms are not large but that's common in Singapore and it was nicely furnished and came with all the necessities. I loved the floor to ceiling slanted window. At one stage I could hear music being played in a neighbouring room so the sound-proofing isn't great (but fortunately my neighbours did not play the music late into the night).

My check-in late at night was smooth. Free breakfast (international choices) is a substantial feed with plenty of choices (don't understand negative comments about the breakfast offerings from other reviewers). Staff were always helpful and friendly; from cleaners to front desk and concierge (always on hand to get a taxi for you). I will add that I did have my ""do not disturb"" sign on on my last day but was door knocked by housekeeping to ask what time I would be checking out (presumably so they could organise the order of room cleaning). I was awake (but had been showering) so no biggie but was a little surprised at the non-observance of the ""do not disturb"" request.

The pool on the roof top was wonderful and the view isn't bad either. The spa was not heated - same temperature as the pool which is a little unusual - warmer water would have been nice but no biggie. The gym was small and mainly cardio machines which suited me. I will add that the gym is not air-conditioned and it was very warm in there late afternoon despite the ceiling fans going at high speed and blinds covered the tall windows.

The hotel is not right on Clarke Quay (Singapore River) but only a short walk to many many restaurant choices for dinner. It is also very close to Chinatown. I would definitely stay in this area over Orchard Road. I walked nearly everywhere from here and there are also MTR stations nearby.

The other nice thing was late check-out (2pm) at no extra charge and continued access to the pool for the rest of the day - my flight did not leave until almost midnight so it was good to be able to have a swim or shower before heading to the airport.

I was travelling solo for leisure on the way home from a China business trip but would happily return to this fairly new hotel with my family. Here's hoping we have the opportunity to travel here again.

I thought this was unprofessional, sending the guests up to the room when it is not ready, or maybe the attendant accidentally left it behind. The shelves above the fridge had a layer of dust coating it, so perhaps the housekeeping was not completed.
The toiletries are minimum, with a 2-in-1 shampoo and shower foam, tooth brush and tooth paste. The toothbrush seemed ""durable"" and bristles were hard.

business,5.0,True,Positive,"Great Location and Terrific Facility This is a great new hotel that opened during the first few months of 2014. The location near Clarke Quay is ideal as it is close to many restaurants, shops and the MRT. The facility is quite nice and the staff are friendly and helpful.

When searching for a place to stay in Singapore, I ran across this new listing. I had never stayed here before but have stayed in many HI Expresses in the past. I am an IHG Platinum Member and generally have an affinity for HI properties. In this case, the location was quite good for my distributor who was located near NUS, which was a $12 SGD taxi ride. More than that, however, the location was marvellous because of its proximity to Clarke Quay and its bevy of restaurants.

I flew into Changi Airport arriving at about 1 AM. I was able to get a taxi for about $35 SGD (or about $26 USD based on the exchange rate at the time) to the hotel. The building was tucked back into a slightly out-of-the-way spot, though my taxi driver had no problem finding it. The exterior was nice enough but nothing special. The lobby area, however, was somewhat striking. It was unusual with a contemporary appeal.

When I arrived, I was checked in by a very pleasant and helpful front desk attendant. The process was very quick, which was much appreciated. My room was significantly smaller than HI Express rooms in the US by about one-third to one-half. However, it was relatively similar in my experience to room sizes in most business hotels in Asia. I have gotten used to this and it does not bother me though it may take some Americans aback. Nonetheless, the room was quite clean and I found the amenities to work well. This included the WiFi which functioned flawlessly throughout my three-day stay. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet allowing me to sleep comfortably.

The morning breakfast was significantly better than I have ever experienced at any HI Express anywhere else. The buffet was quite nice as it offered several hot options such as eggs, meat, potatoes and pancakes. There were also some nice cold options including cereals, breads, fruit, yogurt and more. The coffee was decent as well. It was a lovely spread and provided a great start to the day.

The room rate was quite reasonable in this city where hotels are becoming more expensive. My rate was about $235 SGD on average for the three nights. At the exchange rate at the time, this was $174 USD. Given the quality of the accommodations, this was pretty reasonable. Even though this was presumably a no-frills establishment, it was as nice as many hotels at which I have stayed in other cities that supposedly have higher standards.

Overall, this hotel was one of the better options I have experienced in Singapore. This is saying something significant as I have stayed at several nice places in this city. I will definitely look at staying here again the next time I come to Singapore.",2014-12-01,PreCovid,0

Upon checking in, I notice the hotel seems still brand new. So this was the first good impression that I had. The check in process was smooth and easy; and we managed to check in early as there was available room. When we proceed to our room, the corridor is quite narrow and we faced problem when trying to drag our luggages when there was the housekeeper trolley located at the corridor. So I really suggest travellers only to bring a small or medium sized luggage when choosing this hotel.
As for the room, my wife really felt surprised how spacious it was the room. With the lugagges we had, we still could find some space inside the room.It was really clean as well.
For the breakfast, it was actually nice considering the hotel category.They served quite a variety of food to choose from. However, I would like to comment on the ala carte food. I tried to order curry chicken rice for dinner but they only said they had the fried rice. Considering the price I paid for it (13dollars), it was really unacceptable and very plain.. I hope if the hotel want to attract more tourists, please improve on the ala carte section. Choices also very limited. I am guessing they focused more on getting delivery food to the hotel which you can find in their in room dining section.
As for location, it was not that far from the MRT (about 10-15 mins walk). There is a mall nearby the MRT which you can look around.

Great location, easily walkable into Clarke Quay with its array of bars & eateries, or to the MRT station for easy transport around Singapore. Great service, reception staff very friendly & helpful, cleaning staff always said hello, security on the front door very helpful with ordering taxi’s etc. Good choice of food at breakfast, you’d have to be incredible fussy not to like the choice on offer with fresh fruit, yogurts, bread, toast machine, pastries, cereal & fresh milk, hot items (more of an Asian influence), tea, coffee & juice etc. Plenty of seating available both inside & outdoor for eating, we made use of the outside tables which are shaded & have big ceiling fans which made it an enjoyable temperature to sit out & start the day. Complimentary guest wifi – perfect for checking your email / browsing the internet, but did not attempt any large uploads / downloads. Large rooftop terrace with a reasonable sized pool, nice temperature to swim some leisurely lengths in, plus chairs & sun loungers dotted about the terrace to enjoy the sun / or shade depending on your preference.
However there are a few downsides to this hotel; There isn’t a secure luggage room – bags get placed in the lobby area which although tagged & cordoned off, nobody stopped us collecting our bags before we left & although no problems with our luggage I would be concerned if we had to leave valuables here like this. The bedrooms are tiny – despite having read this on many other reviews on trip advisor I was still surprised when we checked in as to how small the room was. However we did manage, we made use of the limited wardrobe space & shelving in the bathroom, but could only unpack 1 of the 2 suitcases we had with us. Due to the room & bathroom being compact there is no sound privacy from the bathroom to the bedroom, therefore probably best to be sharing a room with somebody you feel very relaxed around! The hotel has a gym, which is on the roof next to the pool, unfortunately the room housing the equipment only has ceiling fans in it & no AC, which is a bit of a shame. Considering the heat attempting to work out without AC is hard work, especially as the rest of the hotel has great AC throughout.

friends,3.0,True,Neutral,"Holiday Inn Express Singapore Holiday Inn express is a brand new, modern hotel at Clarkes Quay, which is a 10 min walk.  Clarks Quay is a lively place crowded with restaurants, fast food outlets, music, fountain shows at night, and a vast variety of cuisines, some of the restaurants being along the riverside. We had a fine Middle Eastern dinner at the alfresco SHIRAZ restaurant. Appetizers of hummus and dips  were served with flat bread.  Opposite it was the restaurant’s Shawarma and Falafal stall, less expensive with high bar tables and stools.  During the dinner, there was a lively belly dancing show in the al fresco seating.  CEJ Jumbo Seafood served an excellent chilli-garlic Crab.  ERDINGER German beer very good.The hotel was very modern and well designed with a spacious dining area. Usually  a Holiday  Express Hotel serves only juices, cereals, bakery items, fruits, etc.  But this one offered a variety of western, Chinese, and Japanese hot breakfast, and had a wide selection of coffee and tea.  There were waiters for removing plates and serve coffee, tea,etc.  The staff were polite and helpful.The swimming lap pool was on the rooftop with one side clear glass. Alongside it was the gym and an extensive walking area around the roof.  The rooms were pretty small, but well decorated.  The bathroom was miniscule with a 4 ft shower stall and washbasin and tub squeezed together.  Some hooks on the bathroom doors would have been convenient to hang clothes.  The cupboard space was quite good, but an extra shelf would have been better than a long hanging space. There was no porter service, but one could take one’s bags up in a trolley.  All in all, it was a comfortable hotel with courteous and helpful staff and we enjoyed our stay in a modern hotel close to a lively area.",2014-10-01,PreCovid,0
friends,5.0,True,Positive,"No complaints, great stay! From the moment we arrived it was everything we expected. Check in was quick and easy, rooms weren't huge but bigger than people make out (didn't bother us as we had no intention to stay inside), shower great and wifi worked well. The breakfast was a great way to start the day had everything that you could need or want and they changed it up as much as possible which was great. The rooftop pool area was beautiful, the pool is perfect for your afternoon cool down. There is an ice machine on level 2 in the laundry that is free so we would fill up a bucket and take some drinks up there and put our feet up. The location is perfect, straight across from Clarke Quay 5 min walk, 8-10 min walk to both Clarke quay mrt or Chinatown mrt. Chinatown at night was awesome atmosphere so it was great being so close (cheap food and drinks). If you don't feel you can walk the distance or like we did of a night after we walked all day we would jump in a cab where everything was no further than 10mins away and taxis are so cheap. Overall we stayed at this hotel for 8 nights and it ticked all the boxes. Staff are great, rooms are clean and done up daily, hotel is modern and very welcoming. I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel for short or long stays. Thank you Holiday Inn Express.",2014-10-01,PreCovid,0

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Good Location, Spotty Service Stayed here in Oct 14 using reward points, so this will review will be based off had I spent $150/night or so.

Location - Location is pretty good. About a 8-10min walk to the nearest metro station at Clarke Quay. Great location as you are near loads of bars and restaurants on the Quay. Also, you are within 15-30min walking distance of Bugis and Chinatown. About 30-45min walking distance to Arab Street, Little India and shopping area.

Accommodations - Rooms are nice, modern and decent size, despite what you might read in reviews. It's not as small as people make it out ot be in my opinion. The bathrooms are really nice as well. The wifi worked great, as did the A/C and TV. Only complaint here was that it was a bit loud when people walked outside the room, so try not to stay near an elevator maybe. You get two free bottles of water in the room (sort of - see later under service), although tap is ok to drink. Shampoo, soap, etc. all provided as well. Extras include the rooftop gym, jacuzzi and pool. Great place to relax, albeit don't have expectations of swimming laps, as pool is shallow and narrow, so other guests will be using it. Also, breakfast in my opinion was really good. Loads of options, decent coffee. I think other reviewers commented on lack of live stations, which is true, but everything was good.

Service - Here is where I knock the hotel. The room was cleaned sporadically and when it was cleaned, there was inconsistency. Some days we got new towels, other days we didn't. Some days we got new bottled water, some days we didn't. You get the picture. I actually had to grab towels or TP from the service cart myself at times

Overall - Depending on your budget, this is a really good place to stay given Singapore prices. I do recommend it, with some hesitation if you want amazing service. Otherwise, it is a clean, modern and good hotel in a nice location and I would recommend it to others.",2014-10-01,PreCovid,0

family,4.0,True,Positive,"Great place to stay We have just returned home from six nights at the Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay. All in all, the hotel was good value, clean and great for a stopover or short stay.

The highlights for us included the very pleasant front desk staff who remembered our names, and the rooftop pool and views.

The staff were helpful and pleasant. Housekeeping changed linen at our request when we noticed dirty marks on doona dovers and pillow slips, before we used them and apparently after the room had been cleaned.

The laundry room was good, with quick washing and drying machines, although the $6 per wash or dry price tag was a surprise. The change machine in the laundry room was handy, however my husband didn't realize this and went to reception to ask for change only to be told that they didn't have any and he should go to the 7 Eleven ten minutes walk down the road!

Whilst we were initially surprised at the size of the rooms, which were very much on the small side, over the time of our stay this became less of a concern. We were pretty much in the room only to sleep, shower and change and it certainly coped well with this.

The hotel is non smoking - big tick on that decision!

On our arrival at around 130pm, the rooms were not ready but as check in is at 2pm, we were advised to wait for an hour whilst housekeeping cleaned. We went for a walk and returned at 3.30pm to find that our rooms we're still not ready, needing us to wait a further half hour for them to be prepared.

To add to this, despite our travel agent requesting interconnecting rooms for us, we were advised that this wasn't possible due to 100% occupancy and that our daughters were to be in a room 10 rooms further down the corridor. This wasnt ideal and we requested an interconnecting room when one became available the following day.

The front desk staff accommodated our request for interconnecting rooms and the following day our daughters were able to move into the room next to ours. Unfortunately, the interconnecting room wasn't available until around 4pm on that day meaning our daughters had to pack up and move their luggage into our own room until it was ready. With the rooms being small, this didn't leave much room for the four of us and we ended up leaving a daughter in our room to wait for the call from reception to advise that the room was ready, whilst we went up to the pool for a swim.

There were a few issues with facilities during our stay although these were attended to in a short time. Issues included a basin leaking water all over the bathroom floor, a window blind coming off its track and repeated issues with our room cards not validating, locking us out each day.

Breakfast was limited in choice, although there was sufficient food for everyone. Unfortunately, there was not always enough seating, particularly over the weekend.

The other concern was seating around the pool and on the rooftop. It would be nice to have more seating and tables up there.

Overall I'd recommend this hotel. It's in a good location for sightseeing, close to Chinatown and downtown. Taxis are in abundance in Singapore and we didn't wait much more than a few minutes for one at the hotel. The space in the room isn't huge but for short stays or sightseeing trips, it's adequate.",2014-09-01,PreCovid,0
business,5.0,True,Positive,"A great hotel to stay Spent two nights in this hotel. The hotel is new and with a unique architecture. Please take note as most of the taxi driver doesn't know where is the location. So better remember it is located at the Magazine Road, junction with Havelock Road (Main road). Then most taxi driver will get you there.

The check in process is quick. Staffs are very friendly, helpful and polite. The room is small but you get what you need. The contemporary design making you feel home. So no worry. If you are nitpicking, you may complain on the cupboard without enclosure.

The bed is comfortable. There are two option for your pillow. Firm and soft. Which is great to pick the right one for great sleep quality. There is also individual air conditioner controller unit in room that you can control the temperature you desire, especially in a tropical country.

There are a lot of tv channels so you will not feel bored even staying in the room. Apart from that, the roof top pool, self service laundry and vending machine (snacks, drinks and condoms) are plus points for the convenience to ease the guests.

The breakfast served with not many options, but the food is good. The brewed coffee is nice.

There are taxis awaiting at the main entrance of the hotel. Thus, accessing to other part of Singapore is not a problem. The nearest MRT station is Clarke Quay, which is about 8min walking distance.

You need to touch your card at the elevator to access to the floor you stay, Which is a good point for privacy and security purpose.

All in all, this is a little gem in Singapore. I will definitely come back to this hotel again on my next Singapore trip.",2014-10-01,PreCovid,0
couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Nothing great about this hotel I stayed in this Hotel for 3 days. At check-in the line was quite long I think due to the weekend rush. I was given a room on the second floor facing inward. Room was very small. Nothing great at all to about this hotel.

There was a foul smell from my bathroom, my room was changed. On the last day of my stay I could smell the same smell in the other room as well. Breakfast was ok, not much items on the menu.

Service at this hotel was terrible, I called at midnight requesting for another quilt since my wife got sick and she needed something to keep her warm. The receptionist simply said sorry we don't have any quilts in the hotel. I told her my wife is sick I really need an extra quilt she said I am sorry I won’t be able to help you. There were few stains on the bed sheet which was changed upon request.

The bed was very small the quilt was very small. I don't recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. This was my second trip to Singapore, if I plan to visit Singapore again definitely not staying in this hotel.

On the description of the hotel it says MRT is a 5 minutes walk, but it’s a good 10 to 15 minute walk. Upon check-out the bellboy was actually forcing us to get a taxi and telling us that MRT will be busy on a Sunday morning, which was not.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,0
business,5.0,True,Positive,"Exceptional service! My colleagues and I arrived at around 10:30AM and the place was very busy. There were a lot of people but we were able to get a room as soon as we got there (though we had to wait for the second room for 30 minutes).

Going to our room for the first time, the corridors were very narrow, which was hard for me because I had two pieces of stroller-type luggage. The floors were also not carpeted, and from my room, I could hear the people with luggage passing by and it could be distracting.

The rooms were very small, with very little space to lay out and open my luggage, but they were very clean and the designs were contemporary. The bathroom was really nice, love that they have bidet, and the hot-cold works great. I could definitely do away with the tub, so it was nice that they just had a shower. I could tell that in designing the room, space was a consideration: no tub, sliding doors, but still great designs!

The vault in our room did not work, but since I was too busy, I wasn't able to ask them to fix it.

I love that the controls for the A/C were easy and worked fine (it didn't get too cold at some point).

The bed was great, sheets were clean and comfy. They had 1 firm and 1 soft pillow, which was absolutely great!

There were complimentary bottles of water for every day checked in. Shampoo/body wash and hand soap were provided in a pump container, which was a great concept by the way--it saves resources for the hotel and I appreciate efficiency!

They have a dock for your iPhone, so you could play music from it. How cool is that?!

Unfortunately, I had no time to check out the DIY laundry and the pool, though I would really have loved to.

WI-FI - super fast Wi-Fi for no added charge! Just the way it should be!

BREAKFAST - Loved their concept of an ""Express breakfast""! They have quite fewer offerings compared to traditional hotel buffet breakfasts, but their pastries were very good! They served different types of hot drinks--and the best part: you can have your hot coffee TO-GO!

LUNCH/DINNER - I didn't really understand how they could serve lunch or dinner (they had a menu for delivery?), but it didn't matter because I was barely in the hotel for lunch or dinner.

CHECK-OUT - I extended for another day using my credit card (my personal online booking), so I asked the staff if I could just use the same room we were checked in. They just checked out my friend, and checked in myself immediately--NO HASSLE AT ALL!

TAXI - they have their own taxi stand, and the bell boy was very nice and courteous.

LOCATION - there's a 7-Eleven a good 2-3-minute walk from the hotel, which is a MUST for me (it's so convenient). MRT, maybe a 10-minute walk away from 2 stations: Clarke Quay Central and Chinatown. There are malls around the area, which is also good if you want to stay in your comfort zone. Location is also very near Clarke Quay ""night life"" area. Even if you're not into that, the view from across the river is great. Bus stop going to VivoCity is also near the 7-Eleven, but in my 5-day stay, I still haven't figured out how to get to the hotel by riding only one bus. The MRT always seems so far away after a long day of walking.

SERVICE - staff are so nice and courteous. My friend wanted to borrow an umbrella, which they were ready to lend, but apparently, they ran out of umbrellas (it was a rainy morning). The manager offered his instead! Everyone from the reception, the bellboy, the cleaners at the ""Great Room"" (dining area), housekeeping.

It was tight for one person with a few pieces of luggage, so I imagine that a couple could find it difficult to manage. This hotel features possibly the tiniest hallways I have ever encountered in a hotel of this size. A maid actually had to back into a hotel room to let me pass with my luggage cart! Perhaps she was just being courteous.

Regardless of size, the place is clean, I slept well, and the location is good. The hotel is near Clarke Quay MRT and a ton of buses.

There are a wealth of nightlife options in Clarke Quay: from the flashy (clubs and bars) to the beloved microbrew hangout (Brewerkz) to some of the most fun and surprisingly uninhibited people-watching in town (the 'drinking bridge' near the 7/11).

I appreciated little touches which were convenient for a business stay, such as carrier coffee cups and breakfast boxes at the breakfast buffet.

solo,5.0,True,Positive,"Fantastic Hotel Stayed here for a recent visit to the F1 Grand Prix. The hotel is in a great location for the city and just a few mins easy walk from Clake Quay MRT. There are a number of excellent transport options with one of the cheapest being the MRT ($2.50SGD One way) clean efficient services and trains. Airport offers hotel shuttle at $9SGD one way again great value, taxis range from $28-38 SGD.        Due to an early flight arrival (8am) the hotel was still able to accommodate me for an early checkin. The front desk staff were very helpul, pleasant and efficient (something the staff at the Airport Inn in Manchester could do with reviewing...this is how a hotel reception should be!)   The room was contemporary by design and was clean, large with excellent bedding and pillow choices. The raindrop shower was enjoyable and refreshing particularly if you had been walking the humid streets of Singapore. The room also had Tea/Coffee making facilties as well as a small fridge. The housekeeping staff were extremely pleasant and always acknowleged you with a greeting.  Free WiFi is available throughout the building albeit my room (477) location did suffer from slow speed at times There was also a terrace and a well provisioned laundry as well as a lap pool on the roof of the building with views to parts of the CBD.  Check out was very good where again the front desk staff excelled in their role, dealing with issues with efficiency and courtesy.

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Comfortable Stay with great service but small rooms The rooms are very small but adequate unless you arrive with many suitcases as we did. All the rooms are the same so no chance of being upgraded unless it is to a room closer to the elevators or in a hallway with air conditioning. Some rooms are along walkways outside of the main buildings air conditioning so walking to your room in the hot, humid air is not fun.

The breakfast is mostly carbs but more than adequate, with pastries, croissants and breads, cereals, scrambled eggs, some sort of sausage, an Asian dish or noodles, yogurt, and fruits. (They could really use a bagel or two on the menu as well). Coffee, tea, etc is also available and all is included with the room rate.

The front desk and hotel staff are very nice and caring and try to go out of their way to be helpful.
The view from the roof is not be missed, especially after dark.
The location was great and taxis were always readily available with the front door folks always being helpful in loading and unloading with a smile.

The choice of meals on the breakfast was wide - pastries, eggs, noodles, muesli, fruits, yoghurts, coffee,  juices and more. I would prefer also ham, cheese or vegetables. The location was in very nice district - Clarke Quay is full of tourists in the evening, there are many great restaurants and bars, clubs, parties, especially young people spend their time here. The nearest metro station was around 10 minutes by walk from the hotel. Also swimming pool on the roof was great, next to it was also small gym.

I did fell into this trap and while selecting the rooms there were selected rooms on offer. However trusting the email  selected a room on 6th floor . The check in was quick but the staff looked a bit lost to handle the booking. And finally on arriving in the room I was in for a rude shock. The view of the room was the hotel corridor !! The room was tiny and the TV was literally on your face. The room was dusty and you could see dust flying on the bed. The room looked unused for a long time and hence they fool you on online check in to select these kind of rooms with the horrible corridor view !! The breakfast each morning was standard fare with no live egg stations . Wifi speed was average . The location is good however a few dollars more and Traders is definitely a better choice !!

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Great New Hotel In Clarke Quay I had a chance to stay at this new Holiday Inn Express for 1 night recently.  This is a great new addition to the Holiday Inn Family.  It is a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay, which is a vibrant (and expensive) area along the Singapore River.  It has loads of restaurants, discos and some boutique style shopping.  I have lived in Singapore before so am very familiar with this area.The hotel is also a 10-15 minute walk to Chinatown and Boat Quay.  So the location is great.  I did notice that due to the layout, it can take a while to get a taxi.  It is just inside the zone where taxis have to pay to enter at certain times of the day.  So taxis tend to avoid entering unless they are already inside.The hotel itself is only a few months old as of this writing.  The rooms are small, but well laid out.  It was a functional room with a small desk with chair and a queen size bed.  The bathroom has a walk in shower which is a good size.  However there is only room for 1 person unless the other person is in the shower.  The 1 crazy design idea is the floor to ceiling window in the room.  My room faced a neighboring condo and anyone could look in on you.  There are curtains but when closed in eliminated the view.  It would have been nice if the curtains rose from the floor instead of the ceiling.This is an atrium style hotel.  Some rooms face the street, but some rooms are internal, so they only have a view of the atrium.  Probably not much to see for these rooms.  Since I was an IHG member, they sent me a link so I could choose my room, there was a basic layout you could view.  This was good.The rooms were quiet and the bedding was high quality with many pillows.  I slept very well.  The air conditioning system worked well.The breakfast was a free buffet for me and there were many choices like breads, noodles, eggs, sausages, juices and coffee.   I think its free for everyone, but you should confirm that.The service staff was pretty good.  But the hotel has many rooms, so the wait at the front desk can take some time.I will definitely stay again and will try to in December.",2014-08-01,PreCovid,0
business,3.0,True,Neutral,"Nice location, bad service We are here for a long business trip of 5 weeks, all in all from outside hotel looks pretty and new. Rooms are a little bit small, but enough space for 1 person. Work desk is really small...hardly enough place for the laptop and some paperwork!
Rooms have really thin walls, if neighbor prefers to watch TV little bit louder or decides to shower at 2am you will be awake for sure.

All of us are really disappointed of the service and staff. Beginning in the morning, its hard to find an empty table at the breakfast, because nobody is cleaning the used tables.
Latest 2pm all towels at the pool are taken and nobody refills them.
Also closing time of the pool is a little bit early (7pm whirlpools and 9pm pool). I think for Singapore standard this is way to early. Experience from other hotels is pool opening time minimum 10pm. This is really annoying to us, because we usually work till 9pm.

Location of the hotel is great! Clarke Quay, Chinatown, Marina Bay, everything in walking distance.
Thats the big plus on this hotel, thats why it got ""Average"" rating.

Also, they checked me in and gave me a room that had not been cleaned. No big deal but it did take a while to sort it out. Singapore service in general seems to be terrible. Not sure why.

This one is pretty brand new hotel, rooms are all nicely decorated, but VERY small. Kind of Europe hotels room size.
The staff are all friendly , but few things happened during my last visit:
1. In one of the days no one service the room. I found it as I left in the morning (and there was no sign ""Do not disturb"" or ""Do not ring the bell "").
2. There is no iron board or iron the hotel can provide the guests in the room. They have DIY iron at the 2nd floor in a special room. When I went there in one of the mornings, the power went down and no one came to fix it for 15 min, so I left and gave my clothes in the reception for ironing. They didn't charge me for that which is appreciated.

Overall, it's a budget hotel. Don't expect all the guest services will run the same as in holiday inn for example .

couple,4.0,True,Positive,"Great base from which to sightsee the city. I booked this hotel 6 months before it opened as the location was perfect as a base for Singapore sightseeing. It's within 15/20 mins walking to distance to Chinatown, and from there you can get the Bus Hopper tickets and bus services too. Plus the enormous choice of Chinese restaurants and stalls!! The hotel is actually on the Robertson Point side of the river, not Clarke Quay....? However, it's near Fort Canning Park, not too far from Orchard Road, and the building works for the MRT will mean it's accessible to everywhere in the city in a year or two's time.

The hotel is on the Airport Shuttle route (from the airport) but on both our stays (outward and return from Bali) the return service to the airport wasn't available at the times we required. Staff on reception were, on our return stay, very reluctant to contact the Airport Shuttle service at 3am in the morning to book it for 7am, and expected us to get up 4 hours early to do so ourselves.......quite bizarre considering on our first visit they suggested that they would do it for us! Hit and miss service.......

Getting the right room temperature was hit and miss, and a shame that the room was too cold on our initial 2-night stay. On our return visit 11 days later the temperature adjustment was more successful, more by luck than skill. The instructions show you how to adjust the thermostat, but not how to save the desired temperature!?

Breakfast was again hit and miss. On our return stay, (it was only 6.40am, and the breakfast dining area had not long opened), we had a taxi and a flight to get, so we weren't prepared to wait 10+ minutes for the kitchen to bring out more freshly cooked food, which is what the server told us.
.
On a positive note, the hotel was as you should expect it to be for 3 months since opening - it was fresh, vibrant, clean, staff were (in general) welcoming and helpful, but I did detect a difference in the staff attitude in the 11 day gap between our stays. I hope that this can be put down to a training need in hospitality and lack of experienced staff being overseen by a supervisor.

I would certainly use the hotel again - and current plans are that we may do so next year.

Apart from a few friendly staff the rest ignored you. The room was very small (basically only fit the bed) and if anyone walked past you could clearly hear their conversation through the door - mornings were the worst.
Although breakfast was included we opted to go to Harbourfront instead. There are not too many hot options and loads of people to contend with.
We arrived super late in the evening and were starving, thought we would order room service - there is no room service only restaurants that deliver to the hotel and delivery had already finished by that time.

solo,4.0,True,Positive,"Mixed opinion Lets get the negatives out of the way first. The hotel would be ideal for folk who only want a very short stay...hence, Holiday Inn  'EXPRESS'. The storage place for your clothes was an absolute minimum especially if you were staying a fortnight. It would have provided more room had the clothes rail been placed horizontal rather than vertical. I was on the 5th floor and found the water pressure was not that good, but maybe better on a lower floor.  The English cooked breakfast was scrambled or boiled eggs and sausages, every day. The pool/jacuzzi area never had enough lounges and only 6 were placed there at any time. The computer was an 'Apple', so there was no tower or any facility to upload photos on Facebook, (I did ask) which meant going to an Internet café. There were times when the computer was occupied by children playing games, which was a tad frustrating as I didn't believe it was to act as a babysitter.OK now for the good bits. The staff were fantastic, the reception would greet you warmly as did the guys in security. A big thank you to Zamri, Sirhan & Joe in the breakfast room, all worked so well and always found time in their busy day to smile and say hi. Lastly, huge thanks to Agnes who meticulously cleaned my room and kept supplies topped up at all times. She had a very pleasant & cheerful manner which makes her an absolute asset to the hotel. I always knew when it was Agnes' day off as things were not replaced, and a time where I needed to go to reception for my own bottled water. Overall I did have a good stay at the hotel, and feel confident this feedback will be acted on as management appears to want to please so that one will have a pleasant stay.

It's a new built and very modern hotel. The rooms are quite small, so are the bathrooms but very stylish and you are not there for relaxation and spending your time in the room anyways. My absolute highlight was the rooftop pool. It's a long pool, with plexi glass walls so you can actually see the people swimming (or just do a ""underwater"" shooting, like we did) and you can see the beautiful skyline of Singapore with the Marina Bay Sands in the Backgound. The Breakfast buffet is good, with bread, eggs, rice, juices, fruits and nice coffe. The only negative is that you can hear the people having breakfast, or cleaning up the dishes in the room, as there is kind of an inner yard where all the nois gets to the rooms, but this wasnt severe.

The greeting received was very cold with no smile whatsoever. She quickly grabbed our details and then said: 'check out is tomorrow at 12pm'. I said, seeing that we arrived so late, could you be so kind to extend a late checkout for us? She said: 'ok, 2pm then'. We thank her for her generosity!

The room was compact but has everything you need in the room. I would say the room is just right for maximum 2 persons. Anyone travelling with little children should reconsider as it would be 'sardines' for you. The bed is barely a double size bed. The duvet is just slightly bigger than the bed. Not very generous for the bigger size people. The sliding mirror glass door which separates the bathroom and the bedroom for us didn't work. So we had to sleep leaving it opened. The toilet I found to be higher than the normal ones. I am a 6'2 ft guy so it would be ok for me. For the shorter ones, your legs will be hanging that's for sure. Not sure why it was not the norm for this hotel?

I was trying to get a shower in the morning and to my surprise, no HOT WATER??? Left the tap running for a while but still no hot water. I guess the supply is just not enough for the morning rush. I found it unacceptable for a hotel! Told the front office staff and all they said was :'I am sorry to hear this'!

The breakfast was included and don't expect it to have an abundant choice! It's a small restaurant and it's a chop house!

The walls are pretty thin and not very well sound proofed!

Location wise it's pretty good just 5 minutes from clarke quay and chinatown MRT station. But in the heat, taxi would be easier. Overall, it's not a cheap hotel for this star rating. Size of the room is a real issue for those who are looking for 'space'.",2014-07-01,PreCovid,0

Called the reception and even tho probably all their guest who are have a room facing the carpark/reception area can hear the music all the receptionist said was that they couldn't do anything about it. The reason: there is a nightclub next door.

So.. to confirm previous reviews; the breakfast is awefull (they get one of two starts for having fresh fruit), the soundproofing is dreadful and the staff is amazingly inexperienced.

Also, being a platinum IHG member and staying here for four weeks at the time obviously didn't make any difference at all.

Like most modern hotels the building looks nice but has thin walls and doors so noise is very noticeable from inside and out. What I liked was the price - for Singapore it is reasonable but that may change as it gets more established, the staff are efficient, and it is well placed if you want to be in this part of Singapore near ""China Town"" and the mid to upper SIngapore river. The roof area has the pool and outdoor space, it is a lap pool narrow and long but rather innovative being built above ground with a glass wall for the front. It is walkable but a fair walk to Marina and Orchard Road, the business and main tourist districts respectively. There are however two underground stations within a short walk (Clarke Quay and China Town). I was not so impressed with the size of the rooms they are very small and I don't know how anyone with kids would fit you literally don't have enough  room to pass one another at the foot of the bed.

I was staying here for 7 nights..the stay was comfortable..but i feel the hotel need to improve a lot of things to stay in par with the competitors.
1) The breakfast...its was an average breakfast with absolutely no options for vegetarians. the only option for vegetarians were fruits and bread..
2) Too noisy... we had to actually call the reception for complaining about the noise from the adjacent room..
3) Electrical Problems... On the first night we had faced air conditioning problem..which we complained and was fixed by the electrician...on the second night..there were sparks in the electrical switches and lights went off in the bathroom..they fixed the problem in the next 30 mins..
4) Inefficient reception... My guide had placed an envelope at the reception which had tickets for Singapore Zoo..i was not informed by the reception for 12 hrs..when i inquired at the reception in the morning i was sent at the back of the queue where other guests were waiting to either check in or check out..common this is not service..i am already your guest staying since so long and i cant just wait for 30 mins in queue for an envelope..they should have delivered it to my room much earlier..

Apart for the complains I must admit that the hotel was very clean...all the equipments, towels, bedsheets etc were very clean. The room service was very efficient and we faced no problem.

There are also bus routes that go by a bit closer than the actual MRT stations. The hotel itself is well appointed. The staff are friendly and receptive. The breakfast is quite good with a decent variety. The coffee is not what you would expect from American drip coffee - I had to water it down a lot. Two things that bothered me about the hotel, though: 1. I don't know if this is a regional thing or not, but the thermostat in the room works in such a way that you set it a few degrees cooler than what you want, not the actual temperature you want. I only learned this when I called maintenance to say that the thermostat wasn't working. 2. Singapore is hot, and humid, and humid, and hot. That's fine, it's near the equator, so to be expected. But you walk from the MRT station, you're hot, and looking forward to the air conditioned air in the hotel. The lobby is refreshingly cool, but then you get to the hallway to your room and find it's open air. No air conditioning until you actually get to the room. So the lobby's cool air is only a tease.

By the time we werre up and dressed a new announcement was made telling all to go back to your room, the emergency is over. Once at 12:30AM and the second at around 6:00AM duplicating the first event. At the time, the hotel had been open for only a few days.
Our room was quite 'efficient' meaning small but very modern and very clean; air shaft view did not help. Hot breakfast was as promised and as complete as one could ask for in a buffet.

I understand that it was not that big a deal given the tropical weather of Singapore, but it was still something that should not happen in a hotel of this caliber, and a brand new one at that.

Yes, the rooms are small which was to be expected although I have had smaller in New York! However they are brand new which makes up for it.

The rooms are great for a single or couple however I wouldn't suggest rooming with friends - could perhaps be a little too close for comfort.

The breakfast provided was adequate.

The rooftop pool was great - the glass wall provided half an hour of amusement taking photos!

The hotel was close to Clarke Quay and Chinatown MRT which made it really easy to get around. The self service laundry was a luxury after backpacking for a few weeks! I also liked the option of a soft or firm pillow.

The pool on the roof is really nice... amusingly with a view across to the Marina Bay Sands. You can lie in the pool and have pool envy.

Some curious quirks:

There are no irons/boards in the rooms. You have to go to the common laundry.
But the good news is that there are washing machines there which is handy.

The gym is kind of open air... meaning it can very very hot

The corridors are open to the outside air. This means they can get quite hot.... but the rooms are very well air conditioned.

We were staying at Ibis Bencoleen & decided we'd like to move to a location near Clarke Quay. It was a relatively new hotel & it was important for us to have a comfortable place to stay in.

We were not disappointed. The rooms (we got 2) were nice & clean, and the bed were very comfortable. While it had small rooms, it did not feel ""cramped"". The big glass windows gave the illusion that you had the the entire outdoors as part of your space. Be careful though to pulll down the shade for privacy, as you can be seen outside very easily.

The rooftop provided a nice place to relax in the evening, and the glass-paneled pool was inviting. We did not get the chance to take a dip though.

The location of this hotel is also good. Bus stops are not more than a 2-min walk, though taking the MRT will be longer 10-min or so walk to Clarke Quay station. You can also take a short walk to Clarke Quay for a nice evening drink.

Being an 'express' hotel, the idea seems to be to provide all you need to look after your own stay. And this suits me just fine, Happy to save a little on my travel budget and opt out of all the unnecessary added services provided in most hotels.

The room was a delight. Really smartly laid out + nice to have it all brand new with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows. Awesome shower.

There is a guest laundry here and after 10 days on the move, I found being able to do my own washing very helpful.

Long roof-top pool is beautiful + enjoyed a few laps stretching out after my long flight. One side is all glass which gives a slightly surreal experience.

Breakfast included was handy (and easy) before heading off to explore for the day + the inside/outside restaurant setting was really relaxed. I could have hung out here half the morning. Plenty of staff to help out here too.

- Room is extremely small, but is clean and neat. Excellent if you are traveling single. For 2 people it gets a little cramped with hardly any space to move.
- Breakfast is same everyday and limited (in fact very basic)
- No restaurant in the hotel.If you need food later in the day then you either need to go out or need to order through the partners
- The hotel is a completely non smoking property

couple,5.0,True,Positive,"Very nice mid-level hotel I'm surprised the initial reviews of this new hotel are not more positive.  It might be partly because people need to temper their expectations given that Holiday Inn Express is a mid-level (not luxury) brand and Singapore is very expensive.  This one is above average for the brand and you're getting a lot for the price.  First off, I'm going to disagree that the rooms are small.  By U.S. standards they are small.  But you are used to rooms in Singapore, Hong Kong, or most big cities in Europe, then the room size is not bad at all.  There was even room for a desk.  I've had much smaller rooms elsewhere.Location: It is about a 10-minute walk to either the Clark Quay or Chinatown MRT stations, which is acceptable.  Chinatown also has some pedestrian streets with markets, shopping malls, and good inexpensive restaurants.  So it's a pretty good central location, even if the immediately surrounding two-block area is not exactly a tourism hotbed (but does have a minimart and they seemed be adding a shopping mall and a Subway).  More Details: The exterior and interior design is very unique and pleasing.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The rooftop pool area is especially nice. Breakfast had more choices (sausage, eggs, pastries, yoghurt, fruit) and better quality than I expected for a Holiday Inn Express; I'd rate it ""worth getting up for but not getting excited about"".  The power ports seemed to accept any kind of plug (U.S.) in our case, without needing an adapter, which is handy.  The AC was quiet and strong.  The free internet was reliable.  The window curtains allowed a nearly complete blackout, which jetlagged travelers might appreciate.  You can get ice downstairs behind reception.  Getting to the hotel: We took a taxi, which was 38 SGD on the way there and 24 on the way back (both times in early morning with a 50% surcharge). That's about 25 USD each way.  It would be cheaper 9-5 PM, without the surcharges.  Singapore taxis are very reliable.  Supposedly there is a 9 SGD/pp hotel shuttle, which sounds like a good option, but we didn't try it (and maybe available only from the hotel, not returning).  The MRT would be about 3 USD/pp, but you've got a fairly strenuous 10-minute walk with luggage to the hotel.  MRT then taxi would also be reasonable.",2014-05-01,PreCovid,0

The hotel is brand new and is in a very good location. The hotel is very near the Clark Quay bar and restaurant area. You can walk to near by restaurants very easily.

I had several meetings around town and it was easy for me to get to them via taxi so the location is in the central business area. Each cab ride was about 5-10 min. The person in front of the building was very helpful in getting us a cab and explaining to the cab driver where we were going.

The only thing that I did not like was when I arrived my shower did not have any hot water. I mentioned it to the front desk and nothing happened. The next day I had to take another cold shower so I mentioned it to them again. When I got back to the hotel it was fixed but it took two days and several cold showers later.

I would go back and stay at this hotel again. The place is new so they are still fixing a few minor things. The location is great. The rooms are small but the beds are soft and the blankets are made of good quality. They staff are very nice and helpful. The check in and out was fast.

Good job Holiday Inn",2014-05-01,PreCovid,0

Only minor things that need some concern.  - I found no DND/Make up my room sign anywhere in my room. - The Housekeeping forgot to refill my soap/shampoo dispenser on 2nd day of my stay and left the dispenser open. - somehow I feel the blanket is a little bit too small for queen size bed especially when there are 2 persons sleeping.

Everything is pretty much what you would expect from Holiday Inn.  Free Internet (wireless) and is acceptably fast.    Only a couple of issues - they do not have room service.  For someone who is busy working, this would be a plus.  I have to leave the hotel to eat.  May not be a problem for others who have more time.  The restaurants that they recommend take an hour to deliver fast food...an hour!  again, no time to wait.  This is not Holiday Inns fault, but poor planning on their part.

Avoid rooms on the Havelock Rd side as they are noisier but they have the amazing window feel over the road.

Saying that I also have to mention that with new hotels comes a few problem. Like noise of some work going around and and some things just failing at a moment notice. For example during the night some alarm went off. Sounded like a fire alarm but just was very terrible. Except this other stuff is great. I liked the concept of having a DIY laundry but would love if the room was air conditioned as it was very hot. The wending machine on the ground floor and laundry room was a good. Coming to transportation, the hotel is a bit far from MRT station and Bus stop and the nearest convenient store 7 11 is also a bit far. The room at the moment are clean but some things in the room are a bit down like the shower started without notice one night and the flush wont stop so I think a minor tweaking of stuff will do. The front desk staff are all very good and professional and really helpful. The breakfast, although not much, but was perfect for my taste and the grab and go was a very helpful thing. I would suggest a nearer convenient store and a bus stop is all that is lacking. Oh yes not the forget the swimming pool. It is wonderful but more shade on the roof top will be helpful and increasing the closing time from 7 to 10 or 11 pm will be very good as it is very hot in the day time to go up and in the evening the pool closes. Please also mention the smoking area at the 4 floor, over the car park plaza, very clearly as that will help them who smoke to find their way. Lastly I did not knew that I had safe in the room.

Although there is no restaurant in the hotel there are many restaurants within easy walking distance at Clarke Quay which has a great atmosphere at night. All in all it was a very pleasant stay.,2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
friends,4.0,True,Positive,"Great idea for staycation Brand new hotel with spacious resort like layout, and nice rooftop pool made us wonder have we checked into the right hotel. Room is decent size and we were surprised by the more upmarket feel as compared to many other standard HIE layout. Love the floor to ceiling slanted window with shades, if only the view is greater. Toilet is mini yet functional, love the rain shower and water pressure is just right. Located in the Clarke Quay area with lotsa reminiscence of my favourite neighbourhood. Food varieties are stone throw away in Chinatown and plenty of drinking holes in Clarke Quay, all within walking distance. If you have craving for Japanese foods, Liang Court cannot be missed.

Experienced fire alarm twice around late 2230hr and early next day 0700hr, apparently other room guests forgot to close both the bathroom sliding doors when using hot showers. The hot water temperature activated the fire alarm in the bedroom. Not a fancy experience to walk down the stairs.

Aircon seem too cold in room and having difficulty to regulate the temperature. First contact with the engineering team seem futile after which they suggested room change but it was not offered by Front Desk. Second contact with the engineering team when I called up for the faulty electric kettle, the uncle is very helpful where he replaced the faulty electric kettle and make sure the replacement unit is working well. The same uncle took a second check on room aircon control and manage to regulate the room temperature to be more bearable.

Like the idea of Express Start Breakfast, you can enjoy your breakfast in The Great Room at ground floor or have it Grab-and-Go if you are in a rush. IHG Rewards Club Gold Elite membership allow us late check out at 3pm, provided us ample time to enjoy the rooftop pool when it was left deserted. It was a pity that the jacuzzi was not working then. Check in and out are processed swiftly with acknowledgment of Gold Elite members, thanks to the Front Desk team including James and Sebastian. Overall a pleasant stay, great idea for staycation. Keep up the good work, we will be back soon.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,1
family,5.0,True,Positive,"An excellent new hotel I was a guest for two nights at this new hotel.I found the rooms to be well appointed with high quality fitments and in immaculate condition.The service was excellent with pleasant,hard-working staff who were thoughtful and eager to please.There was a good work ethos and when times were busy management willingly helped out in areas were the need was greatest.The lobby had good computor facilities and free WIFi was a definite plus. Breakfast was above average for express hotels. and being included in the rate is a bonus. The swimming pool area is brilliant situated on the roof top with a super pool, a spacious sitting area, and wonderful views over the city.   The hotel is ideally situated between two MRT stations at Clarke Quay and Chinatown, has a good bus service, and is 5mins from Clarke quay and it's many eating places. I felt this hotel was excellent value for money, and wish them every success for the future.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,Sweet stay The room is pretty small but functional. Lobby entrance is spacious and impressive. The al fresco dining on the ground floor is also quite big. I like the little info/tourist cards available at the lobby near the main door. The luggage trolleys used are those you get in the airport - which is a great idea. Swimming pool is one of the best I've seen. Great use of space. The DIY laundry room is also a good concept - very new for this part of the world. Checkout was quite slow but I guess it's just because they are very new and still ironing out a lot of things. Overall a good job and a pleasant stay. Will definitely return and also recommend to others,2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"Good but can be more I stayed for 4 nights. Hotel is very new. Room is small (same like other hotels in Singapore) but ceiling is very high so it make room so comfortable, room has no noise protection you can hear everything happen in the corridor, I even woke up at 3 am when some guest head back to their room. On the second day, a fault alarm at 7:30 am for a minute.

Breakfast, overall are good. Staff are friendly. Restroom at the lobby always dirty especially during breakfast time.

Compare with the rate that I paid SD 220 at night I think it's a bit too expensive.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
family,4.0,True,Positive,"Great 4 nights at HI express Clarke Quay This new Holiday Inn Express was fabulous, awesome outdoor dining with serious fans giving a lovely breezeway even in the heat of the day. Rooms small but really nicely done with everything you need for a city stay. Rooftop pool is lovely. Breakfast was good for express standard, staff were great, location is fantastic, right near the river and Clarke quay, Chinatown 5 mins walk away. We did have a spurious fire alarm at 11 one night, evacuated down the stairs, can't blame the hotel or staff, the auto system detectors are in the entry outside the bathroom door, sticker on the shower screen clearly says keep the door closed when showering.........someone didn't! Was a small inconvenience for me and 12 year old, not so small for the poor ancient who took 5 flights of stairs in front of us! I recommend this hotel as a good value for money option with lovely decode and amenities in Singapore.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,"A Nice Hotel - But! for those reading this review who are regulars at Holiday Inn Express Brands you will probably never stay at another Holiday Inn Express like this one - anywhere!!

and thereby is the problem

the design of the Hotel is fantastic, very high quality concept which if your sat in patio areas has more of a Westin or a W brand feel about it

the Roof Top pool is pretty cool and the Gym is also very good

however when comparing the room size to standard Express brand rooms there is a real problem
though the beds and pillows are good the size of these rooms are 30% smaller than you would find in Express hotels in Europe and probably half the size you will find in the US

i stayed for a few days and after a while its was quite claustrophobic also not impressed with the guest amenities dispensed hand soap they use.
the top of the dispenser is easily removed and the soap inside could be contaminated so very poor security on this point also you have no idea whats in the dispenser

as a few other reviewers have said the hotel is new so has a few snags to be worked out but nothing major other than the system they have for manning the bar which is done by the reception staff who tend the bar when not serving at the front desk.
this leads to very poor service and long waiting times, on 2 or 3 occasions i had to walk around to the desk to request some service.
as an added consequence the experience of these staff in serving is very bad and if the bar gets busy i imagine its going to be chaos!

staff in general are pretty good and hopefully will get better as they gain experience

Quality of the breakfast is good and the breakfast coffee is half decent (a rarity in a hotel)

some good local restaurants and bars and only a 10 min taxi to Orchard Road

rates wise i think they are expensive i know the design quality puts it a above other Express hotels in SP however its expensive for an IHG Brand in general
the other big gripe is that they give no recognition of IHG Reward points status
i am a platinum member and didnt even get offered a drinks voucher, this point alone would prevent me from using this as a first choice for my next trip to Singapore

All in all though not a bad Hotel but needs a few rethinks on rates, recognition and Staff competency but its worth the very good rating on the design concept alone",2014-03-01,PreCovid,0
business,5.0,True,Positive,"Right on target! Being familiar with the Holiday Inn Express hotels, as they offer me as independent business owner good value, I truly enjoyed this new hotel. Just opened and for me right on target. The rooms are 'compact' but gave me all I needed for this 3 nights stay: great a/c, good wifi (and free) wonderful bed and linen and a great shower. Loved the high ceilings and the open air concept of the atrium style hotel and guest corridors. The only feedback here is: would love to have a channel like BBC world or CNN versus Sky TV and Russia Today(?). But not a big deal as sometimes good to stay away from CNN for a while I guess. Staff: on target, super friendly and wanting to help. Location: just a one block to get to the river and off on my fav run around Marina Bay. Also a quick 5min taxi drive to get to my meetings in the CBD. The roof top you should not miss: I used it to stretch and yoga after my runs and take a dip in the pretty large pool. Nice views as well. There's even a well outfitted gym! Overall: on target in all aspects, value, style, location and staff. Will be back soon!",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
solo,5.0,True,Positive,"A pleasure to stay here This is a beautiful, well presented and immaculate hotel – as it should be as so new.

The first floor has a lovely outside space with shade, plenty of seats and a variety of seating options. Staff are friendly and helpful and provide good service. Reception staff helpful and after checking flight time offered late checkout without prompt.

On the 4th floor there is a garden terrace, a lovely spacious area with nice plants etc, however no chairs, seating, loungers etc so not really sure what the point of this area is - no shade though.

The roof hosts a sun deck and pool. Again well presented with space and plants. Only about 10 sun loungers and no alternative seating, no shade.

The rooms are on the small side but adequate and cleaned to a very high standard. Rooms directly opposite lifts can be noisy.

Not for the traveller who is fearful of heights as lots of glass and open areas at height.

Being a new hotel most taxi drivers could not find it, the name ‘clarke quay’ is deceptive as on the other side of the river which confuses the drivers further. Despite telling road name etc taxis could not find it so I was dropped at random places and advised to walk and finding it – however this is not a fault of the hotel

Would be interested to stay again in a few months to see if high standards are maintained.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
couple,3.0,True,Neutral,"New is Good; New is Bad The hotel is very very new. Lobby, decoration, swimming pool are all good. Room is small but cozy. It is not recommended for family because the room is just too small. Breakfast is fine and convenient.
However, during the first night and the second day in the morning, there were two times of false alarm! The alarm kept saying there was an emergency situation and after 2 minutes, when I started to run out of my room. The alarm said that the situation is under controlled. After I settled again, it started the emergency alarm again! Then I called front desk for around 10 time until someone pick up the phone and they said it was a false alarm. The alarm was too annoying. Then early in the morning, around 7:30, the alarm started again!
I understand that there is better to have the alarm than none. However, the hotel should test the alarm before.
Hoping it will be better in the later days.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,5.0,True,Positive,"Fantastic pool and rooftop Great new hotel in Singapore. Location is ok, 10 min walk to the next MRT station. Restaurants and bars are close.
Rooms are very small, for one it's ok, with two person plus two large suite cases you might run in trouble. Room deco and setup nice and efficient. Large rain shower.
Breakfast has a large selection, you can seat in or outside.
The best part of the hotel is the pool on top. Very long, 1m deep and good for a swim. Rooftop has fantastic views !
Don't know why this hotel is branded as HI Express.. It's more a boutique hotel like indigo...
Highly recommended!",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0

Staff look very stressed need more training..  Security staff just sitting out side. Not helping at all, what a joke.! Took long time to check out again.  I always stay in holiday inn atrium, just wanted to try the new brand! But never again.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,4.0,True,Positive,"Good value Overall we are quite happy with this hotel.For a 3 star hotel in Singapore it was really more than adequate. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable.Choice of 2 comfortable pillows which we liked.The pool on the roof is very nice also.You can luxuriate in it and view the marina bay sands, wishing what it would be like to be in their infinity! Nice shower head and shower.I understand there have been a few teething problems with check in but as a couple we did not experience any.Free breakfast every day was a plus but hot options would benefit from some bacon mushrooms and tomato to be excellent! Every day the same scrambled eggs, noodles and rather tasteless sausages.No matter, it's free so no problem! Fruit, pastries , cereal and fruit also available. Another thing I greatly appreciated was free wi fi. Nothing bugs me more that having to pay for wifi. It always amazed me that hotels still made you cough up for wi fi access. Just up the room rate a bit to cover it and no problem.Well done hotel for making it free.

Another thing which would be good would be availability of some newspapers to read over breakfast or in the reception area. I think a few copies of local papers are always interesting when one is in a foreign country and something nice to read over breakfast.There are good washing facilities available for $6 a load. The soap goes in automatically and there is a change machine available. We also found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. One thing that you MUST have in this hotel is somebody to help you with your bags when dropped off by the taxi. We managed OK but other people would not. This is important as it is the guests first impression of the hotel.Dragging your bags in is not a good look. The security guard just looks on and could be mistaken for a lazy employee! Hotel is very convenient and you can walk to MRT and Clarke quay in 5 minutes. If you want a cheap meal on your first night I would jump in a taxi and say take me to the Maxwell Hawker Centre, 5 mains away by taxi. Go to Tian Tian Hainan chicken stall and grab a cold tiger beer! No better cheap meal in Singapore! Our only gripe was when we were at the bar we ordered wine and the quantity was very small - at least 150mls in future please!

Anyway overall we would definitely recommend this hotel.",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,3.0,True,Neutral,"OK for one, not for two I stayed recently on business and it was great to stay in a brand new room.

Pros: The pool and rooftop area, cleanliness, close to Clarke Quay for a drink or two, wi-fi.

Cons: Check in process (maybe as it was new, but these people weren't ready to check in busloads of people at one time, which is what they had to deal with); size of the room (the Queen bed rooms were the same size as twin rooms... and they were tiny). Breakfast wasn't great either.
The air-conditioning panel fell off the wall when I first tried to use it.

Most of the issues were around the newness of the facilities and processes being refined. There were definite bonuses to staying there, but mostly around the proximity to Clarke Quay..",2014-04-01,PreCovid,0
business,2.0,True,Negative,"Never again Booked through booking.com as advertised as new hotel. Checked in late after arriving around 11.30 pm and from the outset not a good experience. No door staff to help with baggage (in fact the security just watched me unload a taxi and make a return trip to the taxi to bring all bags into the lobby). Room keys provided but the lift didn't acknowledge my floor nor did the room allow me access - returned to reception and the clerk eluded to this being my problem. As with most hotels in Singapore rooms small. No iron etc so advised to use the 'self service laundry room' (which is located on second floor and has a temperature similar to that of a boiling kettle). Air con in room broken and fixed at 20 degrees - again when reported treated as if this was my fault. Internet in room terrible - drops in an out randomly - apparently this is my equipment fault (note book, iphone, blackberry and ipad are all faulty apparently) - and yet I managed to get a superb reception if  lead down in the corridor which is where I want to do all of my emails of course!

The rooms are quite spacious with the beautiful from the large window, love the design of the rooms and roof swimming pool. Gym open for 24 hours, good choice for people in business trip..

couple,2.0,True,Negative,"Disappointing Checked into this Hotel on 29 April. I was very disappointed. For a new Hotel, check in was very poor. The room although very clean and we'll appointed, was below the normal Holiday inn standards. The overbearing smell of formaldehyde used to protect carpets, fabrics as protection was very present in the room, indicating that the room was not aired properly  before selling it to customers. It immediately gave me a headache and sore throughout.The AC did not work. The temperature did not get above 19. There was no hot water in the shower and at the wash hand basin. I raised these items and was told it was because it was a new hotel and they could not do anything about it and they did not have a maintenance team. I was continually disturbed during the night by people walking in the corridors and from what I think was the crackling of a two way radio. The best things were the gym which was well equipped and the pool. Bad design on the pool though with the water splashing onto the walkways. Sorry HI express, I had to check out as this Hotel made me sick.",2014-03-01,PreCovid,0
