Date of stay: August 2023,Sam M,Extremely slow WiFi speed and issues with room - avoid.,"Hotel's location is quite convenient when travelling for business. That is just about the only plus I can think of.

Negatives in my stay included:
- Extremely slow WiFi speeds - not even enough for a WhatsApp call. When enquired, I was made to pay an additional amount for marginally faster WiFi - this was S$80 for 3 days - not at all good.
- Breakfast was not included with my booking - although that might just be the way the booking was made so not the hotel's fault. I paid S$29.70 for daily breakfast.
- The hair dryer in my room was broken.
- Aircon controls in my room had a mind of their own.
- Wash basin kept getting blocked and was very slow to drain.

I stayed in Room 223 so your experience in other rooms may vary. Overall the hotel was not great value and being charged a lot of money for just about workable WiFi was a total cash grab. I would not recommend this hotel for business.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"London, United Kingdom",76 ,17 ,1.0,

We stayed in 4030 with a room facing the pool. There was a little noise from children in the pool but it wasn’t late and didn’t last for long. It is close to Clarke Quay, a short walk to Chinatown and a good food court and also the MRT.
The only negative was the design of the toilet in the room which didn’t have a solid floor to ceiling door so there was potential for smell to be in the small room when one used the toilet.

Date of stay: August 2023,Cosmic57,Beware the hipster pseudo-bathroom,"I was going to give it a lower score based simply on my preferences but that’s hardly hotel’s fault. The fact is that every member of staff I interacted with was professional and pleasant. The hotel is clean and the rooms comfortable. The location is excellent - a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay and it’s MTR station, 15 minutes walk from the bars and restaurants of Boat Quay and just a bit longer to the heart of the business district.

The one objective criticism I have is the wifi. It’s hopeless; I had to do Teams call back to the UK on my phone’s 4g because the hotel wifi kept dropping out. I expect better.

My subjective gripes - the bar has all the atmosphere and comfort of a temperance Hall and shuts early. Not a problem - I didn’t use it.

But…

My main gripe is the “bathroom”. Why does some clown in the design department of the hotel chain think it’s a good idea to take what was a perfectly good bathroom out and substitute it with an open plan sink area with a tiny toilet and tiny shower at the back? I can just about understand it in a modern hotel designed that way but this hotel once had a bathroom and now it doesn’t. This is a creeping blight in hotel chains.

I was on my own - just as well as the door into the toilet has a half inch gap where you can clearly see the bed. Had my other half been there she could have turned and seen me on the crapper from bed. Not my best look.

I try to avoid hotels like this like the plague but unfortunately they never reveal if they have what I term “hipster pseudo bathrooms”.

I most certainly will not stay here again",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",190 ,77 ,,3.0

Date of stay: June 2023,Alan S,Hotel is very tired and really needs an upgrade.,"We only stayed here for three nights to break up the long journey home from Australia, and chose the hotel due to location and the fact that they had rooms that had direct access to the pool. That indeed was great, especially for a quick cool down from the heat, however the room itself was not great. It was a small room with a very bizarre layout. There is no separate bathroom as such, just a small wall with a weird gap that separated the bed area from the shower cubicle and toilet, both of which had somewhat transparent frosted doors which offered only minimal privacy. The decor is very old and tired, with obvious dents in the walls and scuff marks in many places. We only had two bath towels and two flannels on arrival, (no hand towels). One of the flannels was dirty, and there were marks on the bed linen. There were also marks on the carpet and a badly wired light inside the wardrobe which had tape applied over a connection. On our arrival, the concierge on duty was helpful opening the door for us every time we went out and arrived back, albeit no offer was made to take our cases to the room. The next day, no such attention, and the guy on duty that day gave us poor information about the MRT. On the third day as we were leaving struggling with two large cases, two small cases and two hand luggage, no-one even bothered to say we hope you had a good stay or ask us how it went, and we had to struggle out the main doors ourselves while the two employees at the concierge desk just stood by and watched. Overall, we were disappointed. The hotel is very tired and is in dire need of an upgrade and if we had been staying longer we would have asked for a different room, however we were out a lot and so it did not really matter that much. I would look elsewhere, especially if you are planning on staying more than a couple of nights.",,"Dunstable, United Kingdom",63 ,69 ,3.0,

Big shout out for Pettrina and William on reception at the Park Regis who were brilliant and looked after so well when arriving after 23 hours of no sleep.
Clarke Quay is a great location to be based if you want to explore and close to Canning Park, the Museum, Chijmes, Raffles and the Raffles City shopping centre. Check out the basement food court with a difference!
The Park Regis is definitely worth a look over the bigger more expensive hotels, which seem to charge a fortune, when all you need as a traveller is a clean room, friendly staff, great service and a lovely pool!",Trip type: Travelled solo,,5 ,10 ,5.0,

We had to call them to get it done. This was in despite of the fact that we kept the ""Clean my Room"" light on right before we left the room in the mornings.

Rooms and amenities as described and pictured - Clean, smells good and as listed. Loved our bed and soft pillows had me sleeping like a baby. The air-condition works perfect on a very hot weather. The shower heater works perfect. We loved it esp. after walking for the entire day. The toilet bidet is strong (and can be adjusted), and the towels and robes are perfectly clean and smells good. The housekeeping replenishes the water bottles and some kits esp. when needed (at least no extra cost for us). Just not used to an open type rest room where the only door is leading to the shower room and the toilet area, but works.

Tried their buffet breakfast, and worth it at almost 30SGD. Ambience is good too, with helpful staff.

The only thing I probably will say is an opportunity is their Concierge staff who doesn't speak English too well. When the Reception told us to check with Concierge for the weighing scale for our luggage, the Concierge staff just referred us back to the reception.

Unprofessional.  Unprofessional.  Unprofessional. If the concierge was supposed to be a security guard in disguise then they FAILED; they never ever looked up or welcomed me as I entered the hotel.

Date of stay: September 2022,Judi-oz,Past good rating no longer applies as service sadly lacking,"I have stayed here on previous occasions and had enjoyable stays with good service. This last stay did not meet those standards. On arrival around midnight, we found that the twin beds that had been requested over a month previously were made together into a King size with a single quilt. As I was travelling with my adult son, this was not appropriate. The front desk receptionist worked hard to rectify the situation, providing an extra room on the same floor for one of us for the night with the beds in the original room to be separated the next day. This meant that one of us could not settle in as we had to move out of the room the next morning before 11 but at least we could keep one room.
The beds were separated the next day however the housekeeping staff did not see fit to service the room at the same time so there was not new water and the towels were left lying where we had left them. Once again it was down to the long suffering night receptionist when we returned from sightseeing around 11pm to get bottles of water.
We requested a slightly later check out - at 1pm the next day but were told we could only stay until 12pm without paying extra. Given the lack of service we had experienced to that point, I would not have thought this to be a big deal however evidently not even this small effort could be made in compensation.
While the rooms were generally clean, the beds are getting very saggy and mattresses need to be replaced.

In general, the hotel is good, clean and bright. The housekeeping crew is very accommodating with my small requests. The only problem I have with this hotel is the smell of drainage in the shower room and toilet, the smell was not as strong during my stay last week, however, it's quite strong when I returned to stay at the hotel (in a different room) this time.

They were in the middle of renovations of the common areas so except for the pool there was nothing else open. What I really hope they renovate though are the rooms. They are old, the carpets look like they're still trying to cling onto the 1960s, the tv in my room wasn't working, the fridge also was barely hanging on, the mugs were dirty so I didn't bother using them. There was also one plug in the main room and then another one in the bathroom, so really limited for the million devices we all need to charge.
I would also recommend staying away from the 516-520 rooms, that seemed like a particularly older part of the hotel, and the view is straight into a neighboring residential building where you can see very clearly what's happening in there so they can definitely see what's happening in your room (If you're traveling for work maybe that's fine, but I was on vacation so I didn't want to spend it with my blinds down the entire time), also that part of the hotel is right by the main road so it was very noisy.",,"Melbourne, Australia",7 ,,3.0,

Negative
The restaurant for breakfast was not available (but never mentionned while booking), and the hotel was proposing some in-room breakfast.
When I woke up, I tried to call the reception, the restaurant and the room service to get my breakfast, and I was unable to reach anybody. I had to go in the lobby to ask for my breakfast.
There was no possibility to chose and even impossible to get a coffee or a tea. When asking fo a coffee, I've been answered that I had to use the instant coffee available in the room...
The food finally arrived and was served in a tray like in airplanes. It was was disgusting and definitely not acceptable for a 4 stars hotel. I have some pictures and I will check how I can share them.
Only one staff for the check-in and check-out. I don't understand why it takes so much time for checking-in or checking-out, when you have already shared all your data and even payment details while booking.

On the customer service side the staff are very helpful with accommodating requests even if the hotel is undermanned. I am also grateful for the cupcake and card given for my birthday.

I didn't get to try other amenities, only the pool that while it is not too large there are only a few people using it so I had a good time swimming by myself.

Within walking distance of Clarke Quay MRT, it is easy to be spoilt for food choices from hawkers in Chinatown to Restuarants are Robertson Quay.

Similar high praise would be given to the staff of Park Regis - the foundation of any worthy hospitality establishment. My wife and I were attended to by Charley and Yati, both of whom were familiar faces that facilitated out stay throughout. A hotel is fundamentally made of the its people, and they put a smile on our faces.

While there may be some room for improvements, such as limited TV options and provided beverages, they are minor complaints of an otherwise relaxing experience. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples and besties, but other groups may find the room options to be less compelling due to their size of the fact that the is no real separation between the bedroom and the toilet area.

We did not use the swimming pool, but we noticed plenty who enjoyed the facility - yet it is not overcrowded too.

Finally, if do you consider this option, do ask if you can get a room with a view. We had one facing Clarke Quay/Fort Canning in a rather unique vantage point - a view that was the cherry on top of our getaway.",,,8 ,6 ,5.0,

It's not just the rooms a good hotel offers, service leaves a deeper impression.
I feel like more in a 5-star hotel here.

They check on my mom's, her helper & my needs (we stayed in different rooms as my mom needs a bathroom with wheelchair facility) regularly without disturbing our tranquility.
PR team handmade my mom a Mother's day gift, trying to make her feel more at home, away from home. The outstanding team sent us Mother's Day cakes & anything we asked for anytime (even sanitizer spray!)

As for the immaculate room, the bay window overlooking Fort Canning Hill & Clarke Quay is so comfortable, I want to park myself there & read, listening to music all day!
Room: nicely sized, sound-proof, eye-pleasingly designed for comfort. Rainshower is a daily bliss.

Food catered by ""BELLYGOOD by Tung Lok"" offers such delicious meals, I unknowingly got hooked & looking forward to all my 3 meals!

Date of stay: December 2020,Sunny,A True Home away from Home,"Hotel Park Regis Singapore proved to be the true home away from home where I had to serve a 14-day stay-home-notice (Dec 20 202 to 03 Jan 2021). And I am happy to share my experience without any bias or prejudice !!
Although I had to be isolated in just one room for all the 14 days, but arrangements and the care by the hotel staff was phenomenal. Right from your early morning breakfast with a personally initialed thought-for-the-day card, to providing you amenities you requested, a personalised watsapp chat connectivity, and right till I went to sleep after dinner, I never felt “lonely”. Given that they were dealing with very sensitive, potentially COVID patients, and in large nos., the hotel staff excelled in both their professional etiquettes as well as the required emotional quotient in dealing with such situations, maintaining the highest standards of hygiene and order always. Given that they were tasked to deal with a completely unprecedented situation, I am amazed at their level of preparedness. In fact the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was confident that we would be all ok.
Meals were arranged “made-to-order”, even catering to basic needs like “no chillies” for me !! Every request was greeted with the highest level of courtesy and efficiency. Basically, I NEVER heard a “no” from them, except in matters restricted by the government. Now it is possible on occasion there may have been slips with other guests during this same period, however I can almost guarantee either those omissions would have been extremely minor, and that the staff would have found a way to make it up to them ! The internet connection was super-fast given that so many guests holed up in their rooms would have been online at the same time. I was on regular video calls with my family for long hours each day, with zero connection outages or even slow connections.

The reason for highlighting the above circumstances was important to indicate that if this hotel staff could manage such an “emergency” so beautifully, I can imagine what fun it would be to stay here on a proper holiday without the current restrictions !! They do have a fully equipped f&b outlet, but it was closed given the circumstances. Whether you are solo or with your family, with Clarke Quay just across the road, Hotel Park Regis sure promises to be your ideal stay location whether on business or leisure. And I certainly highly recommend it. See some attached pictures !

I sincerely thank the hotel management and every staff member for doing their very best. I wish them a great 2021, and hope the regular tourist inflow starts asap !! Great Job Hotel Park Regis - love you guys !!!",Trip type: Travelled solo,,8 ,1 ,,5.0

Having a wall sized window in each room helps beat the gloom of being stuck indoors for 14 days.

While I felt slightly concerned if I was going to be comfortable due to the small space and the fact that I had to work throughout my stay, I found myself growing to enjoy the space, the view and the constant engagements with the staff through their regular check-ins, daily motivational cards and quick turnaround for requests. They had engaged a pretty good caterer for the stay, which made the stay more pleasant, but what I have to acknowledge is how the service levels were not affected despite the pandemic. Every call to reception for any matter was dealt with promptly and patiently, despite the challenges they may be facing with multiple unique requests and a multitude of food deliveries that the SHN guests might have. The only small thing was the minibar was not cold, which was a dampener, but by no means a dealbreaker. Wifi was comfortable to even do my regular video calls, and the room had the basic necessities one might need on a stay. Again, kudos to the team for making this stay a pleasant one.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Singapore, Singapore",22 ,11 ,5.0,

There is a sitting area right by a large glass window that overlooks the pool. For a room that's not particularly big, I was impressed by the amount of smartly designed storage space for all my luggage. So despite my two weeks stay, I had a ""free"" room to walk about. I also like the rain shower and the comfortable bed and pillows. :)  The hotel staff were all very attentive, friendly and professional, right from the moment I arrived and during my entire stay. They made calls to every one of us on quarantine to check on our well-being and asked if we required any additional necessity items or help.

I had a couple of issues, which I am sure if they work on are pretty doable and not at all heavy on their pockets

1. Infant food- They denied making anything for my baby, not even a simple mashed potatoes. Even after explaining them the situation

2. They instead offered us bananas, after we pais for it. A couple of bananas for the infant and I had to pay for them too.

I have stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels in few countries and they are generally happy to provide infant food and milk for free. How much a 1 year old can really eat. When I am paying upwarda of 250 SGD for a night , 5-10 SGD is nothing but , the gesture makes people more humane.

I felt they followed the system, which is great but the staff should apply some heart too.

Another issue, there was no one at the pool area in the evening and I had too get the towels from my room.

The room was well worn.   The sink was cracked and didn't drain.   The water pressure (and temperature) varied in the shower enough to be borderline dangerous.  The toilet is a glassed in stall with plenty of air space above the door, so nothing you do in there is at all private.   There are limited power outlets.  At least on the 5th floor you can hear every conversation by the pool clearly.The worst part.   We happened to be staying there the night they were doing electrical maintenance so the power was off, but the emergency lighting in the room works.  Good news: the emergency light works.   Bad news: it shines right at the bed.    The hotel was courteous enough to warn us and they did not have a choice since the testing is a legal mandate.  However, a small bag of trail mix seems like small compensation for having the emergency light shining in my face from 10:00PM to 2:00AM.

We came back at 2pm as we had to get ready for NYE night at Marina Bay and they said the room would be ready between 2-3pm. When asked the room still wasn’t ready. Just after 3pm we was allowed to check in.

The staff again were really nice.

Our room was nice and simple.

The layout of the bathroom wasn’t the best and we had little tiny bugs around the sink and taps.

The bed was really comfy however when I woke up in the morning I couldn’t stop itching and had little bite marks all over me, this happened a lot more on the last night and when checking out I told a member of staff and they apologised. And offered some cream for the bites.

The tv in our room was okay, however our remote/ tv was a little dodgy and when we wanted to turn it off it wouldn’t turn off. The remote or tv wasn’t working at all. Therefore we had to sleep with it on. 6am the next morning it decided to work and switch off. Luckily the next day, when we went to watch tv they had a power switch off and it turned the tv off itself.

The pool is nice and you are able to help yourself to clean towels from the gym.

I can’t fault the staff in anyway. It’s a lovely place to stay, however due to the constant itching and bites I had when leaving I probably won’t stay again.

It was only a short walk to the MRT stations ( Clarke Quay or Chinatown). Literally on the door step you have Clarke Quay offering a great selection of bars and restaurants. China town is approx a 15 min walk and was our favourite area of Singapore, particularly for food. Back to the rooms, we booked a standard room ( 2 adults /2 toddlers ). We read the reviews before travelling so we knew it was not possible to fit 2 rollaway beds / cots in the room. To keep costs down and get around this issue we packed 2 of those ready made inflatable toddler beds in our suitcases and this solved the problem, yes it was cosy but not unmanageable and for us it really offered a practical solution. Staff were very friendly throughout the hotel, nothing too much trouble. The hotel offers a free stroller hire which we found really valuable as we had only brought one and our eldest toddler was tiring from all the walking.

Date of stay: September 2019,GandCAdventures,Pretty standard accommodation in a decent location,"Stayed at the Park Regis during the Grand Prix weekend. Chose the hotel based on the walking distance to the track (along the riverside) and the pricing given the high demand during the race weekend.
The first Park Queen Room we were offered was quite grim; there wasn't much of an outlook or natural light, and the decor was very dated. Due to the length of stay, we requested an alternative room which appeared slightly updated and was overlooking the adjoining mosque which was preferable.
The standard room is fairly generic with a queen bed, flat TV etc but the bay window is a nice touch. The layout with the ""open bathroom"" is a little annoying for a couple in terms of privacy etc, but its workable.
We did not have the daily breakfast or eat in the ground floor restaurant. The pool area is decent with a small number of sunbeds. The location to the fringes of both Clarke Quay and Chinatown is pretty good, but there is limited dining or retail within a few minutes walk of the hotel - you must walk for 6-8 minutes to get to anything at all (Chinatown Point or Riverwalk).
In general for the price the Park Regis is OK and for a short stay its adequate, but with so many hotel options in the city I don't think we'll return.",,"Singapore, Singapore",358 ,189 ,3.0,

Room was a typical city/business style, - clean and adequate. Accommodation in Singapore isn’t cheap, - and for the price I paid, - you would get a lot more elsewhere in Asia, - put the price seems average/fair for the area. Breakfast was nothing to write home about, - though I’d prefer if the coffee was a stronger Italian style, rather that the insipid American sort. Staff were courteous and professional.

Overall, my stay was fine. The only annoyances were being woken in the morning as a lady was shouting down the corridor asking if any room wanted their laundry done !!

After speaking with management they worked hard to change our room to a cleaner one and one with a balcony and I must say I was very impressed with the staff here.

The hotel itself is in my opinion in need of a little spruce up and I really didn’t like the layout of the room with no real bathroom just a shower and toilet in the middle of the room in small cubicles offering zero real privacy or separation, obviously that’s a personal opinion.

If I were to travel to Singapore again I wouldn’t stay here and would look for a hotel that felt a little more upscale and with a better designed room, that’s no reflection on the staff though who were very helpful.

Was further disappointed to find we could not get a continental breakfast in the dining room, only a full buffet breakfast for $27.
The pool was a pleasant spot and a nice retreat but you cannot get a snack or drink there which ruins the holiday experience.
We found the room on the small size, and it was unusual to have the vanity in the bedroom, and shower and toilet in adjoining glass cubicles. Judging from the mould present inside and outside the shower, as well as rotting carpet, ventilation is a major problem with this type of layout. Toilet ventilation also needs to be improved when it is located as part of the bedroom.

Date of stay: August 2019,krys_k,Moved out after first night of three night stay,"A one star review deserves facts rather than opinions:

Booked a Quay room (pool access) for our first 4 nights of honeymoon trip and was given a standard room. At no point during the checking in process was I informed of this. The room we were moved into was not near the standard that we would consider booking at all. When we lifted the curtain to see the view of sights we realised that the window was facing another room’s window and we could see the guest sitting on his bed facing our bedroom. The room smelled of damp too.

After booking Quay room (by the swimming pool) before arrival I communicated with the hotel three times via email on various questions. Again wasn’t informed of downgrade during those conversations.

Went to reception to ask why I wasn’t given booked room. No responsibility taken, staff blamed Agoda and was told I needed to speak with them. Despite the fact that there was a large difference in price between the Quay room and standard room we were not offered any refund.

Spent 2.5 hours on phone with Agoda rather than visiting Singapore which was the purpose of trip.

Next morning staff continued to push responsibility onto everyone but themselves (Agoda, booking agent). However, hotel is first point of contact with customer - issues should be sorted with customer at this stage and hotel should deal with any consequences with partners following this.

Moved out as hotel staff refusing to take responsibility for issue and provide adequate solution. In fact they did not provide any solution.

Received follow up email where hotel again blamed all but themselves. I replied to them and still have not received response over five days later.

Moved to Hilton Conrad where I saw customer service at its best - when our coffee machine was broken, received a handwritten apology letter from the Duty Manager with a box of chocolates.

Mr Jack Chua - General Manager - who has the time to reply to each post on TripAdvisor, who knew that we were so disappointed that we were moving out, couldn’t be bothered to speak with us at the time and rectify situation.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",701 ,910 ,1.0,

The hotel is located very close to Clarke Quay which is lovely to walk around and has plenty of restaurants and night life. It’s easy to walk to or get a taxi to Marina Bay Sands also.
The room was well presented and clean, comfortable bed and functional bathroom. It was also quiet with good air con. There was no room service or food options which was really annoying however I’ve just read in the review responses that it’s under construction (we didn’t realise this). Breakfast was okay though I do feel it could have a few more options, as a vegetarian I really struggled however in saying that I struggled in general in Singapore. Great amenities including the pool and gym. We got engaged whilst we were staying there, it would have been nice to receive a nice fruit platter or bottle of wine or something (staff were aware as they took our photos) but that’s just extra customer service really.

When we got down to the reception, we found about 50+ people sitting in their sleep wear, looking tired and annoyed at the same time!! Some of them broke into laughter when they saw us fully dressed and ready to travel and made some light hearted comments!! Some were eating from the buffet!!
The fire engines were present and the hotel staff were dazed /confused enough not to bother about our check out or getting us a cab. We just rolled out to the street to find ourselves a taxi.

Date of stay: July 2019,blessed116,Concierge Dream Team - Park Regis secret weapon,"Stayed overnight in this boutique hotel on the way back from Batam Island, Indonesia.  Quick check-in, very helpful, offered to print out boarding pass and ticket to an event the next day. Had a very comfortable and quiet room. There was no room service, however, Concierge gave great instructions on where to eat out in the evening at Clarke Quay a short walk away. We were really glad we got out! Excellently located hotel.  Breakfast served in the lobby was very tasty with a wide array of food. Good service. Check-out was noon, which left a whole day to explore before returning to the UK. Concierge happily took care of my bags leaving me luggage free to explore.  They were exceptionally helpful, polite with exemplary service. On my way back from a cable car trip from the Harbour to the 'Bicentennial Experience' I had a hiccup with a very rude taxi driver and had to return to the hotel as the taxi driver purported not to know the destination I required in order to attend the event. This was very disappointing and I instructed him to return me to the hotel (cost $S8).  However, the lovely chap in concierge saved the day; seeing my distress  (gave me instructions on how to complain) called another taxi who was waiting at the front of the hotel and ensured they knew the location. This taxi driver was exceptional, chatty, put me at ease, exchanged some lovely stories of his daughter doing exceptionally well in the UK, and left me in a very happy state.  Returned back to the hotel (to a change in concierge shift) after the event to collect my bags (again concierge perfectly executed, as one returned my stored bags, the other suggested the benefits of seeing a waterfall in the airport. I cannot thank them enough for putting their best foot forward for Park Regis, and Singapore!  Please extend my thanks for the chap who sorted out my taxi and saved the day!

Its location is phenomenal tucked away just over the road from Clarke Quay and the MRT its easy walking distance to go anywhere. The pool was relaxing and tranquil after a days adventures. While we chose to sleep in most mornings so we weren't dining for breakfast it looked great also. This hotel isn't too big that there are too many people around making it crowded and less relaxing, its smaller and more personal and we loved that about it! Rooms were cleaned well and staff were very caring and helpful. The hotel also willingly helped make sure our room was in a quiet location and we had fantastic sleep ins!

We were also a bit disappointed to find a letter in room advising that they had NO food and beverage service although a breakfast buffet was available. We had booked this well in advance and we feel that management should have notified our agent regarding the changes to services. We had the breakfast on the first morning and for the price found it underwhelming, much better options around the block. The staff told me that they had no idea when the F and B situation would be resolved,so we feel that although the location is great it was not the package that we had purchased.

Everyone that our group of 6 came in contact at Park Regis was always very friendly, professional and accommodating. The hotel and facilities were well maintained and the rooms offered a very comfortable stay.

It's worth mentioning that our friends lost their luggage on their way from New York and the concierge was very helpful in also trying to contact the airline and keeping our friends up to date. This was extremely stressful for our friends but it was nice knowing that the hotel too was trying to solve their problem.

Unfortunately the rooms are not for me - great for one person but absolutely zero privacy if sharing. Personally I like to toilet and shower in private but as others have said the room lay out makes this impossible. Rooms however were very clean and nicely decorated, albeit compact. There is a pool but there is no lounge or bar - at least not when we were staying - not sure why it was closed. When temperatures hit 35degrees it’s great to lie by the pool but there was no way of getting any drinks or refreshments. Also no way to have a drink or night cap after a long day. Not what you expect from a hotel of this calibre. Breakfast was the usual fare in large hotels. Staff however were all lovely, polite and helpful.
There seemed to be an old roof top bar, which was just lying empty, surely if restaurant/bar was being refurbished, this could have been opened up again, even just temporarily?
Perfect location but just lacking privacy in rooms and amenities to make for a pleasant stay within the hotel. If you’re a lone traveller however it may be perfect for you.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Peterhead, United Kingdom",99 ,28 ,,3.0

Room was compact, but clean & comfortable, with a decent shower. Also worth noting that there is a bit of noise from the street, audible in the room ( we were in 334).

All staff were friendly, professional and efficient.

Date of stay: May 2019,Scozzese,Great location,"We spent two nights here at the beginning of May. Reception is on the third floor and it took some time for our rooms to be allocated as there was a problem with the computer system and they couldn't access all bookings.The staff were very apologetic and it was eventually sorted and we were given our room keys.
Perhaps we were just very tired from the long journey but it took us a while to figure out that we needed to use the room key card to make the lift work instead of just pressing the button for the correct floor to our room.
The hotel location is very good being close to Clarke Quay. The rooms themselves are a little strange which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms have everything you need, but the layout is very odd as there is no separate bathroom. The wash basin is divided from the bed by a floor-to-ceiling mirror, but there are gaps on both sides, so if you are at the basin you can easily be seen.
The shower and toilet are both in cubicles with frosted glass doors, but are part of the bedroom. It's a fine arrangement for couples or friends who are completely comfortable with each other but it would be very awkward otherwise as there is very little privacy!
Breakfast was included with our room rate and was good with plenty choice. The staff were all helpful and polite, and there was no problem arranging a taxi to take us to the airport at the end of our stay.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Edinburgh, Scotland",12816 ,39 ,4.0,

Don't bother buying the breakfast. It is not worth $33. It is rubbish -semi-warm, soggy and tasteless items sit in bain maries just getting colder and soggier. That's provided you get past the door person who will say you haven't got it booked, requiring you to go back to reception 2 floors up, confirm that you do and have them call and advise them of this.

The rooms are quite small and they don’t have a seperate bathroom. The vanity and the mirror which goes up to you he ceiling is the only thing that separates the room from the ‘bathroom’. The toilet and shower are behind obscured glass doors. It doesn’t leave anything to the imagination as your partner sits on the bed while you’re doing your business.

Date of stay: April 2019,Rishi,Stay here when visiting Singapore!,"I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights.

Location: The hotel is a 2 minute walk from Clarke Quay MTR station, which is just a few stops from some of the major attractions. There is a large mall nearby, just a five minute walk. In this mall there are also plenty of food options, including bakeries.
If you are looking for a hawker, the “people’s park complex” has an excellent choice of hawkers and is a 10 minute walk away from the hotel.

The rooms:
I stayed in the standard room. Although it might seem small in dimensions, the room is set uo in such a way that it feels way more spacious. A downside of the room is though that the toilet and shower windows are made out of frosted glass and can not be locked.
Everyday you are provided 2 bottles of water in the room.

The amenities: The hotel has a pool which is everyday open until 10 PM. Around the pool there are various relaxing chairs. You can stay in these chairs past 10 PM, as long as you do not enter the pool itself. The hotel also has an excellent gym, which has a large selection of weights, a bench press, a machine for back exercises and even more. One of the best gyms I have ever encountered in a hotel.

The staff: all the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. From checking if I left nothing in the taxi while leaving the taxi, or giving tips on where to eat or opening the door for when you enter the hotel. This was by far beyond my expectations.

The breakfast: One morning I had an early appointment, so I opted to have breakfast in the hotel. The breakfast was ok, the food itself tasted good but a larger selection of food would have been appreciated.

Price of the rooms: the price of the rooms might seem a little steep. But considering what you pay for even a basic room in a hostel in Singapore, the price does not seem so steep anymore. As a matter of fact, I extensively researched several hotels in Singapore before booking this one and from experience I can say that it’s hard to find a hotel that can beat the
Park Regis in terms of value for your money.

In conclusion: Good location, good rooms despite lack of privacy in the toilet/shower. Breakfast choice could be better, but the extremely helpful staff make up for this minor point.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,The Netherlands,125 ,89 ,5.0,

There was literally no sound insulation so traffic roared all night and I could hear the voices of revellers on the street below. Not a good room for light sleepers.

Reception is on 3rd floor. Entrance is for dining and meeting was nice area for breakfast, pool area/gym facilities were good however pool gets shaded quite early in the day due to adjacent high rise office. We picked the hotel because of its location next to Clarke Quay however there is no direct crossing from the hotel to Clarke Quay, you have to do a walk up to main traffic crossing to get across and then walk back on yourself. Swisshotel is more convenient in this regard. Close proximity to China Town (eat here -not clarke Quay) Central Shopping Centre and the MRT station (best way to travel).

The room is also open concept ~ so make sure you are very comfortable with your partner because the glass shower & toilet stalls are lightly frosted ;) our room came with a free cell phone to use while we are here, a coffee pot, hair dryer, iron and board and a mini fridge.  they provided bottled water daily and the rooms were clean.  Our last day staying was right in the middle of our trip so we decided to do laundry.  there is a washer and dryer for guests in the basement.  It costs about $18 which isn't cheap but better than hauling our stuff all over town to look for a laundry mat.

The hotel is extremely clean and efficient, comfortable to rest. People efficient and kind, at the recpetion, at the restaurant, at door.
The room (mone was a Deluxe Double room City View) does not have a separate room for the bathroom; the basin is inside the bedroom, and the toilet and the shower are two different ""boxes"" with white glass walls and doors. I saw it also in other hotels, pretty modern style. Personally I am a bit conservative on this and I prefer separate bathroom.
I was there for business, so I had some problems with the desk which is pretty large but not particularly deep, with a TV on the wall which is covering part of it. You can still work with your laptop, but the spare is tight and your chair shall be against the bed.
The ground floor is completely taken by dining area, so the lobby area is pretty limited; reception at the 3rd floor.

We arrived a bit travel-sick after an overnight flight, and they made an effort to bring our check-in time forward.Our room was comfortable and, though compact, was ingeniously designed.  We found it bright and clean, and the room staff kept it that way throughout our short stay.  It had a pleasant view over the hotel’s own terrace and of some of the towers at the edge of the CBD behind.  Clarke Quay is a good location, although, with the scope and efficiency of the MRT, access to anywhere we wanted to go was quick and easy.  As weary travellers, we hadn’t the energy to do the tourist thing the whole time, but the hotel has a great pool.  Singapore is just a small hop north of the equator, but the layout of the pool enables mad sun-worshippers and sensible shade-huggers alike to enjoy the astonishingly clean air of this beautiful garden city.  The hotel provides pool towels and comfortable loungers, and the waterfall feature adds interest to a relaxing facility.We only took breakfast at the hotel, because there is interesting and cheap oriental food to be enjoyed all over the city, but breakfasts scored highly for quality and variety.As with every hotel that makes guests feel they’d be happy to return, it’s the attitudes of staff which make the biggest impression.  Everyone at Park Regis seemed happy to be helpful.  From a prompt response to emails we sent before arriving to smiling attentiveness from the front-of-house conciergerie to courteous efficiency at reception and friendly service in the dining area, we felt very welcome at this hotel and in this city.  We certainly intend to visit Singapore again in its own right and as a staging post for visits to our family in Australia, and when we do so, we feel no need to look further than here for good and good-value accommodation.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"County Armagh, United Kingdom",183 ,129 ,,5.0

First, let's talk about the breakfast, it is a buffet breakfast and foods are nice to eat and I am already happy with it.
Second, let's talk about the room environment. I stayed at 203( I remembered and it is definitely the same floor where the pool located). It is small but enough for me to stay with. The mattress is so comfortable and it is so clean to sleep on, the chair is nice, the toilet is hygienic, but here's the problem, when I was having a shower, the shower door can't fully close and it makes the whole floor was wet and I have to use many towels to cover the puddle, I tried to fully shut the door but I cant. It is a bit of pity here but it's fine for me.
The location is nice too! I just walk 5 mins and I am already at the Clark Quay station waiting for the metro. This trip is so nice and besides the door problem, it is just nice to stay with.

The room itself was good, I was in a disabled access room, so had more space than a normal room and a balcony. The room was also clean, with the normal cleaning service provided (and x2 free waters per day). The pool and gym areas are also of a good standard, these features give the hotel a good, friendly vibe as there are always people buzzing around there. I think the value for money you get is good, it's in a good location, about 10/15 minute walk away from the buzzing Chinatown, and right opposite an MRT station (Clarke Quay). It's also right by Clarke Quay, where you'll find plenty of places to eat, and it's where the Riverside Cruise starts. It's a great location in some aspects, and then other places of interest are a little further (Gardens By The Bay, Orchard Road). But it's good for what you need!

We checked in late in the evening after a long day of travel and thought we would order some room service, but found out there was no room service available.

This time the air conditioning was not cooling but they fixed it. But first night was horrible. Rooms are very small but similar as other hotels around Clarke Quay. For bigger rooms you have to pay lots more. A bit strange is the reception on 3rd floor. To enter into the hotel you directly enter into the breakfast area.

Staff are friendly and courteous. Once you enter the hotel, they will take hold of your luggage while you make your way to Level 3 where Reception is - Level 1 is Lobby. Following check in, you proceed to your hotel room where your bags are at your door within a minute.

Gym access is 24 hours, the pool is open from 0600-2200 and both in pristine condition.

The Rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable with direct access to the pool area.

Noise proofing non-existent and I was kept awake with noise coming from upstairs and outside. In the morning the maid came around knocking on every door (her shouts can be heard a few doors away) asking ""laundry service?"" and an answer of no then led to the question of when I will be vacating the room so that she can clean up.

The service was great and the staff helpful. Bed and pillows were AMAZING! I would have given 5 stars, but there was a distinct lack of privacy in the rooms - both in visibility of your room by other guests and with the toilet shower area as it is open to the bedroom area. At night you can see directly into other guests rooms (even with the shade drawn) and they can see into yours, so best use the curtains vs the shade. Also don’t expect toilet or shower privacy as there is a thin frosted glass partition/stall that separates both from each other and the bedroom. Both doors open to the bedroom, which was problematic as opening the shower door got water all over the tile floor, which was a little tretcherous.

I’d like to shoutout Royce; lovely bellboy that greeted us with a simple “nice to see you again” small details that add to a pleasant stay.

Overall stay here if you want to enjoy Singapore without all the tourist traps. This hotel is suitable for families, business travelers and couples.

Date of stay: October 2018,Norman M,"Good hoel, great location.","This hotel is a few minutes from the MRT stations at Chinatown and, closer, Clarke Quay. A modern hotel, you enter on the ground floor, where the concierge is, but reception is on the 3rd floor.
I arrived in the early hours of the morning but the welcome and check-in was friendly and efficient.
My room (as I found out) had a minaret outside it, which was fun. I think it’s not used for I heard no muezzin. The room, as is not unusual in space-hungry Singapore, was on the small side, although the bed was a large king-size. It was comfortable and made good use of space. No amenities were missing.
Breakfast (and all meals) are served in a restaurant on the ground floor, beside the entrance. Standard hotel fare.
I enjoyed the closeness to Chinatown and some good bars around there. For the shopper, it will be a paradise, although how you would make a choice amongst all on offer, I know not.
I would certainly reuse the hotel.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",317 ,199 ,4.0,
Date of stay: October 2018,Ann C,Disappointing Guest Service,"This hotel has small rooms but it is reflected in the price as Singapore Hotels are quite expensive. The small rooms seem even smaller due to the open bathroom arrangement and the under window seat which takes up space. The bathroom shower area wasn't the cleanest either. This could all be forgiven BUT check in was disappointing. We had booked 2 rooms, one queen for one person and a twin room for 2 people many months before. On arrival about 4pm we were checked in and sent to adjacent rooms only to find TWO queen rooms. Back down to Reception and then told they couldn't accommodate us side by side and another room that was available on the same floor (level 2) would have to be converted from a queen to 2 singles. When it was done nobody notified us it was ready! First morning one room was disturbed by housekeeping knocking before 8.30am and asking when they could service the room. Next morning which was actually the day we were checking out again just before 9am the other room was disturbed and asked when they could clean the room. As it was the day we were checking out I said 12 noon which was check out time. Never known this to happen in any other hotel. Surely on check out day Reception notifies housekeeping when the guests have left? Concierge seemed to be the only efficient part of the hotel and they were great.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Robina, Australia",697 ,208 ,,3.0

The room size was a bit on the smaller side but for a single traveler or maybe even a couple it should be more than adequate. The location is great and is nearly to lots of restaurants, malls and shops. Transportation will not be an issue either.

Staff were professional - however this was our first time in Singapore, we were traveling as a family 2 Adults & 2 children (11 years old and big boys)
I pre-booked the room through Expedia for 4 guests, however we were given a room with a king size bed and 1 single bed. When I queried this and showed my booking having 4 confirmed guests I was told - 1 single & 1 kingsize bed is all they can do for me - another bed will not fit in the room.
Unless I wanted to book another room ?
Why accept a booking and payment for 4 people in 1 room if you can not accomodate it ?
Why advertise on places like Expedia that you can cater for a family room (4 to a room) - when you clearly can not ?
Needless to say only 1 child got any sleep for the next few nights as the rest of us were all crammed into the king size bed.

But just be aware for travelling with kids that the family rooms offer only one giant bed for everyone. We had 2 small kids 4 and 2yrs that luckily fit into the whole bed. When we booked there did not seem to be an option for any other bedding arrangement in a family room. We asked for a rollaway bed, but the room doesn't really have space for it to fit without losing all the floor space to get to the window seat. Not sure if a twin bed arrangement may have been a better option? Only saw single beds in the twin rooms though.We managed but if you were a family that liked separate beds for kids and parents perhaps not the best option as a family room.We did love the pool, and the gym.There is no real lounge waiting area at the hotel so if waiting for a room (early arrival for check in) or flight (after checkout) there is only a club by the front door that is available for waiting.

The breakfasts were not kept warm in fact one morning they were stone cold until someone pointed it out and then they lit the burners.But did not take them away to warm up.

Date of stay: July 2018,MacT8,3 nights in Singapore- great location base,"I stayed 3 nights here and it is a perfect location to get around and see everything.

Location: Located 5 minutes walk to China Town and 2 min to the nearest Hop on Bus stop it is very convenient. The Quay area is across the road and over a small bridge and is great for nightlife with a variety of cuisine and prices, live music and a good buzz for a few drinks and/or people watching. The hotel is quiet with a pool. Central Quay is a mall acroos the road and there is a food court downstairs offering various cheap cuisine ( and it is AC'd) There is a lovely Salad Lab which was great if you need a rest for street food. Pics below.

Food: I had breakfast included an it offered a decent choice. Cereals, breads/ bakery, egg station, dumpling station and hot western and local options.

Room_ I agree with some reviews that if you are a couple the bathroom is not private. It has misted, glass doors to the toilet and shower and for those who may like to shower (there was no bath) and dry in private my room did not allow for this.

Concierge: Very polite but they did not know very much about tourist things to do or modes of transport to get around. I think management needs to send them on transport to the main sites so they can advise guests better.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",41 ,25 ,,4.0

Date of stay: July 2018,Bethany W,Lovely relaxing getaway,"We (my partner and I) stayed at the Park Regis for 5 nights in July, and although we missed the slightly coooler climes of England, we didn’t want to leave the hotel! We had an all-round thoroughly enjoyable and comfortable stay. The staff were very friendly & seemed tireless in their desire to make us feel at home. Although a few members at first could appear a little reserved (perhaps a cultural difference/due to the business-like nature of the hotel or city as a whole), once you started up a conversation, all the staff were so warm & friendly (& very smiley!). They all seemed as if they enjoy working at the hotel, which I must say does make it a much more pleasant atmosphere to be a part of.

The rooms were interesting in terms of layout; two large ‘cubicles’ side by side, one with a toilet and one with a shower (both large over head & smaller hand held showers), with frosted glass. The sink unit was free standing opposite these ‘cubicles’, with several shelves & plenty of ‘counter’ space to keep all of your toiletries. The usual amenities were included, such as a safe, hair dryer, iron & ironing board, tea/coffee making facilities, mini fridge and room service. They also provided a ‘handy’ mobile phone which was free to use during our stay, and very ‘handy’ indeed, what with this being our first trip to Singapore & not realising how expensive days would be through our UK providers!

Breakfast was served 6:30-10:30am every day, which have a good window whether you were starting early or having a lie in. There was a good range of foods on offer, the hot food in particular slightly varied every day - English ‘cooked breakfast’ foods, as well as dim sum & noodles, freshly cooked omelettes, toast, croissants and waffles, fresh fruit salad and cheese & biscuits, as well as juices, teas and coffees.

Air con & tv in the room also helped to make the heat more bearable & Madeleine if possible to relax in the room for a while when it was all getting too much.

We didn’t use the pool much (as I forgot to bring my costume!), but there seemed to be a handful of guests that kept returning to use it (an outside pool, quite large & lots of lingers around the outside). My partner did however use the treadmills in the gym, and said they were of a professional standard & well stocked (treadmill-wise as he generally sticks to running, he did remark the other equipment was a little limited).

Date of stay: July 2018,Soulseekingyogi,Pleasant stay,"I stayed at the Park Regis two nights for pleasure.  The hotel is very central and is in a great location, right next to Clarke Quay and a short walk from China Town.   It has all the amenities you would expect of a 4-star hotel.  The hotel gym is quite well equipped for a hotel gym and there is a lovely outdoor pool.   I was too busy exploring wonderful Singapore to use either.  I also didn’t eat in any restaurants or have breakfast so I can’t comment on the food, but the restaurants had lovely ambience.  The hotel staff were also very attentive and professional, offering advice on best routes to tourist sites and restaurants.   I had a room on the 7th floor.  The room was modern and clean.  The bed was especially comfortable and the pillows were thick feather filled.  The bathroom layout didn’t work for me personally as the sink and mirror unit is floating in the bedroom and there is only a small gap between the unit and the wardrobe which makes accessing it difficult.  The toilet and shower are in a room together like a wet room, but there is a shower curtain between the two, every time you have a shower you soak the entire room so you have to mop the floor or you end up with soaking feet.    This would be my only criticism of the hotel as I slept very well and had a lovely stay.

There is a safe in the room and mini bar. Also a smart phone is provided in each room from which you can make free local and international calls.

Breakfast was a good standard, nothing to rave about but there was a selection of cereals, pastries, toast, fruit and a variety of local dishes. You can also request omelettes to be made by the chef. I did spot a couple of ants also enjoying their breakfast in the breadbasket but other than that it was a pleasant experience.

The hotel has a fairly limited gym but it serves a purpose and an outdoor pool. The pool is a nice area although it looks out on to the road but the glass surrounding it could do with a good clean.

The staff at the hotel were excellent and helped us out whenever they could. They provided scales to weigh luggage, printed things for us and were willing to help with any issue as it arose.

Date of stay: March 2018,alenaiziEsam89,Theft Incident-Careless Hotel Management and Staff,"we visited Singapore in March 2018 and decided to stay for two nights at this hotel. Unfortunately, our stay was horrible and our entire trip was ruined by a theft incident that we believe occurred during our stay. I am not going to provide details on the incident since it has been handled by the police and there is no point in getting into such details. The annoying and super frustrating part wasnt only that we had something valuable and precious to us gone missing in the hotel but also the fact that none of the hotel management nor staff got in touch with us after our departure. Despite complaining emails sent to management we received zero response in return. Forget about amenities, room comfort, and how good a location is for a second. If a hotel has no decency to email / get in touch with a customer just to comfort them after a horrible incident; if a hotel does not have the absolute basic understanding of human rights and feelings then why should you decide to waste your money staying at such a place? Whether the incident is proven to have occurred on their property or not why dont you email or give a courtesy call to a customer when they needed you to the most? Why ignoring and choosing not to respond to their emails/calls? I believe there is a thin line between having a business or a human relationship with your customer and this hotel has definitely proven to be functioning purely on business prospects and completely neglecting the human side of how to manage a relationship with a customer. I didnt ask for a refund, I didnt ask for a miracle to find our stolen item. All I expected is to be treated with care, as any other human would expect.
Horrible experience, could have happened anywhere else in the world, but could have definitely been managed in a human way rather than a business transaction. I will never stay at this chain again and I will make sure every single potential customer and branch management of the park regis around the world know how a horrible and how inhuman this hotel really is.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",19 ,9 ,1.0,

We arrived and had 2 room bookings & had stated 1 of the rooms was for 2adults and 1child and were told we would all be in the 1 bed or twin singles! No way! After being told we were going to get charged $70 before taxes per night for an additional bed I had to get extremely annoyed for the charges to bed waived.

We have now had 3 room changes in 2 days! Due to room stuff ups and aircon maintenance and no tv service and no offer of compensation for all of this inconvenience. We have young children and this is not the lasting impression of their family holiday we wanted for them.

The service has been absolutely appalling and for anyone looking to stay here my recommendation based on our experience is find somewhere else.
We have been totally put out and the hotel isn’t interested.

Whilst we appreciate most rooms in a busy hotel are not usually available until 2pm you would have thought that someone who had travelled for over 17hours from Manchester hotel to Singapore hotel might be given at the very least a room with double bed to catch up on well needed sleep?  Alas no and we were told to use the restaurant to get food and drink or go to the pool area. Neither of these were we even offered a card to access the pool area or a cup of tea or coffee. Luckily someone let us in to the pool area where we could listen to the cascading water avalanche that fed the pool from a great indoor height, might be a highlight of most Aussies holiday, sadly we were not really in the mood as you can imagine. We were promised a phone call to let us know when the room would be available. After 2 plus hours of ear-shattering noise my patience finally snapped and when I located a member of staff to enquire if a room was available, amazingly a room was became free at once.  The worst experience ever of checking into a hotel and really disappointing that not once did anyone apologise about the inconvenience.

We got upgraded to the pool access room and although we did not have swimming suits ready, we enjoyed the mini seating area just outside the room overlooking the pool. And yes, the toilet may be an issue for some guests but I found the arrangement creative. It was interesting as the vanity acted as a separation from the toilet and the room.

My wife and I stayed for three nights in early April 2018 and enjoyed it very much.The location is outstanding, directly across from Clarke Quay, adjacent to Chinatown and a 5-minute walk to the metro. The hotel is quite moden (as is all of Singapore) and well run. Our 7th floor room was on the small side but comfortable with a great view. The frosted glass wall that defines the bathroom (mentioned in many reviews) was certainly unusual but not big deal for us, although I can see how some might not like it. Finally, in a generally very expensive city this hotel is a decent value for money, although their breakfast buffet not so much.

Later I found out it was because all other rooms were full. I believe that it should have been explained to the guest before just assigning the guest to a different room from what he or she paid for. The hotel did change the room upon my request but the request had to come from me. Had I not noticed the room was for a handicapped (the shower/toilet was completely designed for the handicapped so not only it was shaped odd but also the shower and the toilet area did not have a separation so the entire floor would be wet), I think I would have had a bad impression of the hotel thinking that the rest of the rooms look the same.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Seoul, South Korea",1 ,,3.0,

When we arrived (11am) our room wasn't ready so we wandered around till 3. The room was quite compact with an open bathroom. I do have issue these days with hotels thinking everyone wants to share their ablutions what happened to privacy? The shower and the toilet were in glass (frosted) boxes that were open so you see/hear all that was going on. There was a button on the light switch, we didn't realise, that meant private so our room wasn't cleaned so we had to go out early to let housekeeping in.

The bar was a non place at the side of the restaurant I had a Singapore sling which was horrid, sent it back.

Date of stay: February 2018,CynthiaYue,Hotel is fit for couples due to open concept design,"My husband and I stayed at the Park Regis for 5 nights and our stay was very enjoyable. Absolutely love the contemporary furnishing and style of the rooms.

Check-in- As we arrived to the lobby, the concierge had greeted us and helped us with our luggage. We were then directed to the elevator as check-in desks were located on the 3rd floor. Check-in was quick, staff had given us an overview of the hotel amenities.

Room: Before booking, we had read a number of trip advisor reviews on the room size. As we were staying for 5 nights, we had decided to the book the Regis Room (Family room) to allow us a bit more room for our huge luggages. They are the largest rooms that Park Regis offers. We had a King size bed, an additional dining area and a balcony with outdoor seating area. The room was clean and the bedding was extremely comfortable. The bathroom is an open concept, with little counter space to put your toiletries or to get changed after you come out of the shower.

Amenties: Loved all the amenities the hotel offers: Beautiful swimming pool, nicely equipped gym room, self service laundry room, E-scooter and bike rentals.

Location: We loved that the hotel is located directly across the Clarke Quay MRT station. It is walking distance to Chinatown and Clarke Quay (restaurants and bars). Definitely a huge plus!

Pro
- Buffet breakfast is offered at the lobby with an additional cost. They offer it when you check in.
- Staff is friendly
- Room is clean and bedding was comfortable.
- Each room offers a phone with complimentary 3G internet access and unlimited international calls up to 10 destinations. Guests are free to take it out when exploring. It definitely helped us when we needed to look up directions and google for restaurants.

Con
- No privacy with the use of the shower room and bathroom. It is complete open concept. I recommend to stay with your significant other. Definitely not for friends.
- Corners of the shower room was starting to rust a bit. A little bit of maintenance would be nice.

Overall, our stay was extremely enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this to couples due to the open concept of the room design.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",133 ,79 ,4.0,

But, when we went there, our room was a little small. The size of the room was still something we were ok with, but, what concerned us, was the wash basin was very next to our bed and the bathroom had no lock!!!

But, there was one good thing I liked about the hotel. They gave me a 4G phone with internet that I could use all over singapore!!
It also helps to you to book tickets for rides and attractions.

Date of stay: March 2018,Gwyn J,Most uncomfortable room ever! ,"Unfortunately we failed to read up on reviews for this hotel and fortunately only had to suffer two nights here. The hotel would be absolutely ideal for a single traveller or business person, but for any party of two people, or family it is a definite and loud “stay away” unless you are totally, totally joined at the hip with the person you are sharing the room with. There is absolutely no bathroom or changing area where you can have any privacy whatsoever.  There are only two tiny frosted glass cubicles, one with a shower and the other with a toilet.  Neither have any extractor fan and open out directly into the bedroom, with only a sink and a mirror to obscure the view from the beds. If you are comfortable with sharing toilet sounds and smells with your companion you may be ok, but for myself and my companion it was definitely most uncomfortable, and we found ourselves having to allocate times where we could be in the room alone to use the toilet and shower, and then dry off and change in the small space around the bed.  There are I’m sure good things about the hotel, but whatever things may have been great, they did not shine out enough to overcome the small and seemingly un-thought out design of the rooms. The staff were very polite and customer service seemed good. We didn’t make any complaint about the room because obviously nothing could be done about it.  The pool looked clean and nice.  The breakfast on offer was definitely not outstanding, but had plenty of choice and was quite acceptable to us.   There are electric scooters and bicycles available at the concierge, and we had a package that would include the use of them for a few hours.  It was in our booking paperwork but nobody mentioned it to us on check in, so if we had wanted to make use of our “package” we would have needed to ask for it rather than it be automatically offered and explained.  There was supposed to have been some free gift of a rubik cube for some reason, also which was not offered or given on the day.  We didn’t need any of these things, so it was not a problem, but if they sell these packages, they should at least make good on them and offer them to their guests on checking in. Finally, there is a mobile phone like thing in every room which is free to use inside and outside the hotel.  It appeared to have unlimited 3G internet and could be used to make local and international calls. Great for making bookings or using maps to get around with for anyone that doesn’t have their own phone with unlimited internet. That was a pretty cool little bonus but not enough to make me go back to the Park Regis again until they make a drastic re- design of the rooms.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"London, United Kingdom",9 ,11 ,1.0,

Date of stay: February 2018,sjb2383,"Good location, very small room","We recently stayed at the Park Regis for 5 nights in a Quay Room. The location of the hotel is very good for access to Clark Quay and the subway station, you could not be closer. Also walkable to China Town and Boat Quay.

The room itself is has queen size bed which was very comfortable. Minimal toiletries provided (shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, shower cap, dental kit) but you probably don't need much more than this.

The major flaw of the room is that there is no wall between the bathroom/wet area and bedroom area. It is literally a bed, with a sink and a cubicle toilet and cubicle shower. No bath tub, and no privacy. So if you do not mind sharing EVERY moment with your roommate then this may be okay for you. We found it very difficult for two people with two medium sized suitcases to have space to get dressed and ready at the same time. There was definitely no space for two people to hang up more than 3 items each.

We also found the check in process quite a weird experience. I was given a form with someone elses' details on it and told that it didn't matter as I was 'in the system' and they would fix it up later. I personally do not like signing forms with other peoples details, and yet rather than just print off a new form the receptionist just crossed out the other details with a pen and insisted i sign. Overall he was very strange and this added an immediate sour note to the start of our stay.

Ultimately, this is a business hotel that would most likely suit a solo traveller. If you are looking for more of a luxurious or spacious hotel room, this is not the place for you, but if you want to be close to all the action and just need a place to crash where you don't mind essentially using the toilet in front of your partner, and being on top of each other at all times this will be fine.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",10 ,4 ,3.0,

I selected this hotel because of its central location and the facilities (pool deck, gym) and was pleased that everything checked out just the way it was advertised.

The Quays were within walking distance of the hotel and the front desk was happy to assist and adviced us on places for dinner and drinks.

The room was quite small but since this is central Singapore, this was expected. It had all the amenities we needed and once we managed to stow our (reasonably large) suitcases, we were able to walk around in the room.

The pool deck had various pool beds (single and double) and was actually fairly quiet, which we didn’t expect because of the central location. The gym was not too big but had enough equipment for a full body training.

The room was nice, not too big but good for single traveler or couple. Staff very helpful. Breakfast was okay. Location is really good as Clarke Quay MRT is right across the street within 5 mins walk. Both exit A and B are close by but I would suggest taking exit A. China Town is also very close within 15mins walk.

Date of stay: January 2018,whimsical_ks,Two thumbs up! ,"One of the best things about this hotel is it's location. Just about a 5-min walk out the doors, cross the road and you are at Clarke Quay MRT station! It is so close to Boat Quay and Chinatown too, and just a really short train ride to places like Orchard, City Hall, etc. if you would like to do some shopping and sightseeing. We were worried at first if it was too close to the hustle and bustle of Clarke Quay especially on weekends, but we soon learned our worries were unfounded. We always return to the hotel after a tiring day out exclaiming how we love its strategic location.

Rooms - They are of sufficient size, and is well equipped with everything a traveler may need. Really clean and bed is comfortable too. The closet may be a bit of a squeeze to access due to its close proximity to the wash basin area but really, it isn't even a big problem. Shower is wonderful with good water pressure.

Staff - What is a hotel without its staff, and Park Regis has a good team - from Concierge, to Reception, and also Housekeeping. Sorry, I can't remember names now but the guys at Concierge were courteous and always greeted us, but not to the point of being too much. Reception was always ready to assist, they take action swiftly, and they were friendly without being intrusive. The operators were also really helpful and were reliable, they will assist as best they can. Housekeeping was quick and faultless, and were accurate to deliver requests.

Facilities - Had only managed to try out the pool once, it was clean and really is a good place to relax. Those who wish to do laps, the length of the pool is enough for a good workout.

Overall, a very incredibly pleasant stay and definitely worth recommending to friends, families and fellow travelers. Manage your expectations and you will be surprised at what a gem this hotel is.

Date of stay: January 2018,Frank O,Park Regis has more than meets the eye.,"If you are considring this hotel, you might like to think about this? The breakfast Menu (and others) does not have bacon or pork products because they say they are following  ""Halal"" Policy. This is at best discriminating or at worse biggotted. Here is a Hotel in modern times pandering to Islamic interests at the expense of all others. Personally, any hotel that doesn't have something as basic as real ""bacon"" on the breakfast menu, wont ever get my business again. But there is more to this Hotel than the travel agents etc don't volunteer. We were woken at ungodly hour and annoyed at other times by a ""loud"" dronning noise being emmitted from a speaker system. Would you believe, right under our window (and we were on the sixth floor) was a Mosque...Yes folks this Hotel has a Mosque located next to it, and on further investigation the street ""mosque street"" should have given it away......The Islamic ""call to prayer"" was annoying and even with the windows locked shut it could be heard. There was some modern features about the hotel like the self service laundry facility (token fed $17 wash and dry including auto detergent feed) and a mobile phone with mapping apps and free calls (although our rooms was ""dead flat"" on arrival. The pool area was a bit tired, and it was un-nerving that a ""land scaping"" employee seemed to be watching guests every move. It was ironic that this hotel featured Xmas decorations yet pandered to Islamic interests over western food standards and values.

Date of stay: December 2017,903vjyc,Stay here. Don't think twice.,"Stayed at Park Regis for three nights - 1 night as we flew in to Singapore and 2 more nights on our way out. I was looking for a nice and clean hotel close to popular tourist destinations. There was a subway station very close by - I didn't have to use it though, uber was cheap and convenient for a tourist.

The check in was very pleasant, the hotel stored our bags between our two stays. The rooms were small but very comfortable. Clean, no issues at all. We chose to eat breakfast outside all days - but I did try the restaurant one afternoon - would surely eat there again. The concierge was very helpful as well. Right across Clarke Quay and a stone's throw from Chinatown - stay here, dont think twice.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",24 ,7 ,5.0,

5 minutes walk to Chinatown and right next door to the Singapore River.

If you prefer to walk Marina bay, Orchard Road, Little India are all within 30 minutes walk and you can always get the MRT back.

Date of stay: December 2017,Terry F,Oversold on features,"We stayed here for 4 nights in December 2017.  We opted to pay extra for a ‘city view’, and upon arrival we were told what to expect was a pool view and a street.  I’ve posted pictures of what they deem to be a city view so you can make your own mind up before paying for it.  We kicked up a bit of a fuss about this as it was the only real requirement apart from non-smoking, and we got moved to the 6th floor, so our view would be one of the better ones.One feature of the hotel that really impressed us was a ‘handy’.  This was basically a mobile phone preloaded with apps, maps and browser, and also allowed to make calls.  It was included in a room and saved us a lot of money on roaming charges.  I was surprised that they don’t advertise this more than the view because it actually salvaged this review.  Neat feature.  Besides the view, the other irritating feature of this room was the lack of privacy in the bathroom.  It seems to be a trend in the area, but rather than having a separate bathroom, there are just frosted glass cubicles, and the doors don’t even form a seal.  Maybe most couples are ok with their partners smelling the worst each other have to offer, but we haven’t reached that level yet, so I ended up using the lobby bathroom for my more unspeakable acts (bearing in mind we were also adjusting to a new type of cuisine, these had the capacity of becoming especially devilish).  To make matters worse, the frosted glass isn’t even floor to ceiling.  I can’t be the only one who thinks that this is poor design.The room was clean and the bed comfortable, and I liked the bay window to sit at.  There is a pool (we didn’t use) and a bar area that was ‘closed for refurbishment’, although we could see through the twinkling lights of our city view that no work was currently being done in the outdoor bar.Another reason we stayed here was for the seemingly convenient access to Clarke Quay.  Unfortunately, and through no fault of the hotel, it’s less of a straight shot than the map suggests, and you have to walk down to the crossing and come back rather than just cross the road in front of the hotel.In summary -Good:  loved the handy device, bed was comfortable.Bad:  grossly oversold features, breakfast was bad value for money, room design was poor (bathroom).Probably won’t stay again.",,"Derby, United Kingdom",8 ,9 ,,2.0

This hotel is located across a subway so its easy going around and the nightlife area in Clarke Quay is just a stone throw away.

The room has a nice interior good for solo, couple or friends if you are very comfortable with the person since the sink is just outside and the shower area/toilet are fully stained glass. There is a nook for reading beside the window.

The pool area is not huge but is still good although the lighting and fountain is not working when we did swim. There are rooms with pool access as well.

The handyphone that comes with the room would've been a plus since you get to have a mobile with local number and data but unfortunately the one that I got is very slow that I still used mine.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Imus, Cavite, Philippines",35 ,7 ,4.0,

Date of stay: December 2017,Arapino,Disappointing Design - Great Staff,"My son and I moved here from another hotel just for change.  The hotel is fairly new (about six years old), located in a quiet corner that is close to MRT.  As you enter, the conceirge is on your left with a smalll sitting area on the right.  The rest of the floor is the restaurant where meals are served.  We found that to be weared.On the third floor was the reception; very spatious and welcoming. One floor below (2nd), you will find the pool and the gym.  You will need to go into the gym to get a towel for the pool.  Oh, the pool area is very noisy as it overlooks the main road below.When we finally got to our room, we were extremely disappointed by the size.  There was not enough space for our luggage. It was too tight with very limited closet space (3-4 hangers) and very small shower and toilet areas (each was less than one meter square). The sink was just behind the beds.  I was trying to convince my son that it was OK until we started looking around.  There were too many long hairs (i.e. not from us) even in one of the coffee cups.  We also saw what looked like rot, so I called the duty manager.  Mr. Willie was kind enough to offer an upgrade at a discounted price and we accepted.  For the breakfast, the additional night and the upgrade, we ended up paying more than SGD850.  It was much more than I would have accepted, but it was too late to argue with Mr. Willie not on duty when we were checking out.The ""upgraded"" room had a great view, but very noisy providing for choppy sleep. The bed, a king sixe was good, but we had the same issue with the toilet and bath.  They were too small and too open making it noisy, difficult and embarrassing to use when the other person was awake or asleep.  The odd thing is there was plenty of space in the room, but instead of using it for the bathroom, some one placed a big table and two chairs there.  It really needs a redesign.As kind as the staff were to us, I would not recommend this place unless you are travelling on your own.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Al Qatif, Saudi Arabia",247 ,51 ,3.0,

Breakfast was substantial. Catered for all nationalities.
Used the concierges again for a picture that I had seen regarding a vending machine for cars. They knew where it was and called a taxi again.

The level of service is very high - right from the greeting by door staff and the concierge, to check in. The staff were great throughout, very helpful and friendly.
We were given a room on level 7 (top floor). The room isn't the largest, but was fine for us. We'd read other reviews of the room layout, so weren't surprised with the 'open plan' bathroom - i.e. the bathroom is separated from the bedroom by a mirror with the toilet and shower in separate glass cubicles on the other side. It's quite quirky, but was fine for us.
The pool is great - fantastic for early morning or late evening swim, and very few guests using it at any one time.
We also appreciated the complimentary use of a shower later in the day that we checked out.

Yes the room is small but the hotel do mention the room size on their room description. The small outdoor seating and great location easily makes up for this shortcoming.
We didnt have the buffet but plenty of bfast places around.
The big plus of this place is it is just across clark quay and mrt where you can go to all places as far as the mrt will take you. Each ride only cost less than $1.

I have slept in a lot of bad beds before, but I have never let my bed springs get that broken before replacement. How can you call yourself a hotel when something this basic to sleeping is overlooked?

The sheets on the bed one day had holes in them one day the floor mat was torn. She didn't vacuum our room one day. Our room was 732 is next to the plumbing lift pump which cuts in every 2 mins which I don't think is four stars. .It's a shame your outside bar is now closed that over looks the pool area as it would be nice to have a drink there.

Date of stay: September 2017,AliquisNJ,Pleasant overall experience,"Overall I think this place was nice experience, no major complaints about the hotel itself. I really liked the room on the 2nd floor with access to the pool area, it includes a small space ""terrace"" for your own use and direct access to pool chairs etc. through small gate. The room itself was compact with interesting but very functional setup (in my opinion as lone traveler) . It had all the amenities you could expect from this level hotel.

The staff, including housekeeping, was friendly throughout the trip.

The location of the hotel is good. Clarke Quay metro station is very close, and Chinatown (and its metro station) are also a walking distance away. There is plenty of nightlife on Clarke Quay and wide variety of restaurants close-by. I walked to the Boat Quay and the riverside almost each night of my stay.

I couldn't sleep well on one night because one of my neighbouring rooms had loud noises on their ""terrace"" up until late at night. Even though the room is quiet, the glass door to the pool area couldn't prevent some noise coming in. Also, on some mornings people was early on the pool so it might be problem for you if you want to secure long sleep.

One more thing about the pool: the sun shines to the pool area only until around 3 PM so late afternoon sunbathing isn't possible. For me this was not a problem.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Helsinki, Finland",58 ,7 ,,5.0

There is no divider between toilet and shower except for a thin curtain which screams budget hotel to me. Sloppy room service too as tea and coffee are also not refilled on my second day too. The reception is located on the third floor instead of the ground floor, which is inconvenient.

The little rest area on the window offers a good relaxation spot. It's walking distance to the train station - Chinatown station within 15mins. The pool area is the highlight of the place.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Hong Kong, China",1190 ,246 ,,3.0

Breakfast was good, with a choice of Asian and Western options.
Now the slightly odd things. As a seasoned traveller, having the shower and toilet (that had frosted glass doors) only separated by a small partition was a bit odd. The room was a good size, but the wash area very cramped. Would have been an issue with 2 people.
Could not turn off the Aircon or lower the fan speed, so kept waking up (same as a colleague in another room).

Date of stay: August 2017,dj_lovesholidays,OK for one night,"The definite plus points for this hotel are the friendly staff, location, the pool area and the breakfast selection.

The hotel was located a few minutes walk from the underground railway and it took us about ten minutes to get to Orchard Station.

The pool area is clean, quiet and good for relaxing after a long flight.

There were however some things that meant I would not book this hotel again:
1) the room was a bit shabby. It was clean but it just needed an overhaul.
2) breakfast for my child was not included within the room price. I booked direct with the hotel including my child on the booking and yet breakfast was not provided as part of the bed and breakfast booking (only adults included).
3) the outside lobby area had cigarette ash on every table and most chairs. Obviously an area frequented by smokers and cleaning it up was ignored by staff.
4) the room was noisy at night as you could hear people leaving bars and restaurants.
5) we wanted to hire the scooters they had available in the reception area however you have to download an app that is only available to people who live in Singapore. No other way to hire them!

So i must say that hotel has an amazing location. 7-11 is just 5 mins walk from the hotel..
The only difficulty i faced was getting Indian food, Park regis doesnt have much options in indian food apart from paratha n rice served with mixed veg indian curry. I found an indian restaurant in clarke quay, its name was RAS, food was so yummy but damn expensive.

Anyhow my experience at Park regis was excellent and i will recommend it to everyone whether couples, family, friends or solo.

Date of stay: February 2017,Börge v,Excellent two week stay,"Stayed her on a work related trip for two weeks. Very friendly staff, clean and excellent location. The subway station is right across the road and takes you anywhere you need to go, no need to take a taxi in most situations. My company's office is out of the city at Maple Tree Business City and I made it there within half an hour on the subway. Clarke Quay is right across the road as well as a lot of restaurants in the area. China town is also walking distance away. If you don't mind slightly longer walks, Marina Bay is actually only a 25 minute walk away.

The rooms are rather small but well deisgned so it doesn't feel cramped. Beds are comfortable and the shower I felt was the best hotel shower I've ever had. Prefer a proper shower to a bathtub with a showerhead any day.

Breakfast was ample and decent, they varied items every single day. Though some of them weren't always a success. The hotel restaurant is lacking atmosphere for dinner but the food is decent. There however are plenty of options around to not have to eat there.

As I liked exploring in the free time that I had, the complimentary cellphone with discounts on entry fees to sights was a nice bonus (though the phones do need replacing). You also get two bottles of water every day, however when the cleaning staff notices that you use them up, they put out more. At some point they put out six bottles of water for me!

We appreciated the view (over the pool) and the sofa right ""in"" the window. Another nice feature is the individually controllable AC. The only minor drawback is the fact that the toilets and shower are not fully separated from the room - this was not really a problem for us but might be embarrassing to some. They provide a mobile phone free of charge that was really good to explore Singapore.

The TV stated that no-one was checked into the room. But worst of all - there were stains on the toilet wall.  The overall standard of cleanliness was very poor - fingerprints on glass and dust on surfaces. The hotel moved me into a what they called an upgraded room but which was exactly the same but looked out onto the pool, unfortunately the standard of cleanliness didn't improve-there seemed to be some sort of flying insect problem and indeed there were marks all over the walls where previous guests had swatted them!!

The device can check out restaurants, your email, take photos and buy tickets to all of Singapore sightseeing adventures, plus a whole lot more including making free calls. The device was not power hungry so you could use it all day and WIFI was great. As was the hotel WIFI, very reliable. The hotel staff were fantastic, attentive and very friendly.

The pool with a waterfall was great to use on super humid sunny days, better when the sun is out as you dry quickly. Very relaxing. Only wish you could order a drink. The room was small and there is no separate bathroom i.e. there are no doors only a curtain to divide the two areas, however that didn’t really affect our stay. There was the usual desk chair and a window seat which helped with the room being so small.

The rooms are very well furnished and comfy, the breakfast buffet was quite good and had ample options for vegetarian folks as well.
The hotel provides so much value, we fell in love with the hospitality. Each room had a smartphone which you can carry around the city and use for all local calls and internet. We didn't even have to bother getting a local prepaid SIM! They also provide strollers for small kids, which was such a relief for us to move our 3 year old around.

Date of stay: July 2017,Bron R,"Great location near Clarke Quay & Chinatown, modern, comfortable & clean, good service","Our family of 4 (Mum, dad, two teenage sons) stayed 8 nights at the Park Regis.  Medium sized hotel, we had two rooms on L6.  One room had a lovely view over Clarke Quay, our other room opposite faced an office building.  Rooms very clean & comfortable, good beds & pillows, quality bed linen, modern decor.   Bathroom is open, not a separate room, so not much privacy.  Toilet & shower have frosted glass doors, private enough but not fully enclosed, which means any toilet noises are fully audible ...  Our solution was either to turn up the TV or leave the room!  The twin bedroom has a curtain that can be pulled across to divide the bed area from the bathroom area.  Rooms are well supplied with bottled water & toiletries and if you need extra, staff promptly fulfill your request.  I found staff to be very courteous, friendly and helpful - all requests were attended to promptly.  The exhaust fans in our toilet & shower was very noisy, making it difficult to sleep - it was attended to very promptly and adjusted to our satisfaction.  Air conditioning works very well and is easily controlled.  The location is excellent, barely a 5 min walk to Clarke Quay restaurants & bars along the Singapore River.  Chinatown is 5 mins in the opposite direction.  We ate breakfast at two lovely nearby cafes, Ronin (Hongkong St) and Punch (32 North Canal Rd), 5 minute walk - excellent coffee, meals & service.

Date of stay: July 2017,Travellers,Fine for a couple of nights,"I booked the hotel on location and price. Stayed only 2 nights and we were out most of the time so I was pleased with my choice. However, I would not recommend for those spending longer and travelling with someone.

Things to be aware of: obviously our room was probably the smallest but for 2 with suitcases and bags there little space apart from the handy bench by the window. The bathroom is open plan to the bedroom which looks nice in photos but in practical terms difficult to use in terms of access in and out of the shower or toilet if someone was at the bathroom sink. Plus another reviewer has mentioned that the toilet door doesn´t go all the way to the top so you have to be very comfortable with the person you are sharing a room with.

Positives are: location, good air-conditioning, free Wifi and handy smart phone to call locally and the UK, for GPS or looking things up.

Also view of the pool downstairs, where I can see from. It can be sunny or warm mid day, but the a/c was cool and strong. Wifi is strong.

I tried one of their breakfast sets at the ground-floor Twenty3 dining and it was great～ I also liked the mango fresh rice roll, but it would be better to have it in room. Better to eat with hands 🙌🏼 my attendants were nice, attentive, conversational (with another couple/guests who was asking stuff). Ambience is also nice night or day. There they have wooden tables outside. Looks nice to have a drink.

I missed seeing the deposit box, hence the closet on my first night. And they provide a smartphone where you can use google map and check local attractions or touristy places, which is nice. I forgot if you can make calls from it tho. Housekeeping also made sure my room will be cleaned, as I like going out late.

Date of stay: May 2017,Alan G,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed at the Park Regis for 4 nights at the end of May 2017. It is centrally located in Clarke Quay and in walking distance of almost everything. And for anything that is not local, Clarke Quay MRT station is practically on your doorstep.
We were greeted with a warm smile both at the entrance and at reception. The rooms aren't the largest, but they are adequate and comfy. We had a Park room which didn't have a great view. We'd also seen previous reviews about road noise and had asked for a high level floor, which we got. It was very quiet. We also used the pool whilst we were there - which was great.

We decided against the breakfast add on. $28 a day, per head is simply too expensive and there are other alternatives around about so my suggestion is go out and explore. We ate brekky at the nearby Kraftwich Swiss bakery (near the Swissotel) for under $15 per day for the both of us and that included hot drinks.

Back to the room - we had a queen size bed. There is a TV with HBO and AXM channels as well as non-English speaking channels. Tea and coffee facilities are available too, although we had to prompt the hotel for additional milk on more than one occasion. There is a mini bar too, but to be honest there was no need to use it with Clarke Quay on your doorstep.

It is my third stay at Park Regis and I always found the experience is exceptional.

Although, considering I am a neat freak, I do have some suggestions for Park Regis housekeeping team. I noticed that deep inside the cupboard where wine glasses are placed, there was still dust and wood grains. You might want to have it check thouroughly.

Other than that, I would very much suggest my friends, families and colleagues to stay at this establishment when they are in Singapore.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,1 helpful vote,,5.0,

Saving graces were the concierge staff were superb, it is very well situated for walking or train, local bus or hop on hop off bus.

Date of stay: April 2017,AlwaysLuvMexico,Great Central Hotel & Includes a CELL PHONE !!!!,"First time in Singapore, and the Park Regis was the perfect location to explore everything there is to do in Singapore.  Close to the Clark Cay and Chinatown MRT stations, it provided a convenient location to check out the many attractions at a reasonable, and clean hotel, price.  A short walk to Chinatown (must do), across the street from Clark Cay (unlimited bars and restaurants in the evening), the hotel worked out great.Th best feature, a cell phone to use that included local and international calling, and a local data plan to use google maps to get around, included with your room.....priceless.Nice pool, rooms were a bit small, however well designed.  Restaurant prices are high, as are most restaurants in Singapore.  However 2 blocks to Chinatown for a $10.00 breakfast, $6.95 Beer at the Chinatown Seafood Restaurant, and endless shopping.  Buy the NETS MRT card at $12.00, and add $10.00, and I challenge you to use it all in two days.  The Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By The Bay, Singapore Flyer, Little India and Botanical Gardens are only a short MRT ride away.  The Zoo is the only challenge to get to via the MRT and a bus ride.

The staff here really are amazing - the concierge were so helpful and got our bags to the room with no efforts whatsoever, they also helped with scales to weigh our bags and helped us with maps and directions. At breakfast the staff were friendly and chatty. The check in staff were extremely respectful and helped us. I've never stayed in a hotel where everyone was so lovely!

The bed was comfortable and the room was pleasant. Breakfast was good - catering for all appetites.

There is a pool but we didn't use it. Although it did look very inviting.

Friendly welcome & check in was of ease. Special mention to concierge staff who always welcomed you with a smile & friendly hello.
I unfortunately did not take note of one of the this lady's name, but she helped us by making follow up phone calls to a tour company who forgot to pick us up one morning.

Unfortunately the room is small - but workable. If travelling with friends, I'm not sure how this would work as bathroom is open plan (seperate shower & toilet) but no personal space to change etc.
As another traveller mentioned, we also had an unfortunate shower incident as the hand held hose was facing out the shower when it was turned on, wetting the open plan room - be careful of this.
The swimming pool was wonderful & a great way to end a long day trekking about.
Good location, across the road from Clarke Quay for an abundance of restaurants & bars.

Date of stay: March 2017,chocolatemudslide,Disappointed,"I'll start with the positives. The staff were all great, very professional and courteous. I cannot remember the name of the door person much to my annoyance as I would have like to have given him a good review on here. The name Sanjay just came to mind but I wouldn't bet my life on that. The Park Regis us in a good location, a short walking distance from China town and Clarke Quay just across the road. Clarke Quay is a hive if activity at night with so many eateries to choose from you hardly could tell where one restaurant finished and another started, that is the ones on the water edge at least. I really enjoyed the sights and atmosphere if Clarke Quay.
Now to the not so positive. Our room on the third floor was small, I appreciate you dont need a lot of room to sleep but this was small. Once we put our suitcases in there it really closed it in. The table under the TV could have been half the size and that would have made more room for luggage. While we are in TV, I hope for the Singaporeans sake the have access to more variety than we did at the hotel as it was pitiful to say the least with no exaggeration.
The shower had the best size shower rose I have ever seen and I enjoyed being able to get wet all at once. It was a oversized shower I thought for the size of the room. It could have easily had some hooks on the inside of the door to hang your clothes or towel on but sadly it didn't. The shower had the ability to be overhead or the hand held type with the flick/press of a knob. Twice we got it wrong and the ceiling got a soaking because the hand held was facing up. The water went up over the shower door(as it does not go to the ceiling) into the area where you make your cuppa, and get dressed. It looked like it was a regular event that took place as the paint was peeling. When my sister flicked the towel up to dry the ceiling as the water was dripping on her as she made a coffee the paint peeled off. Whoops. The cleaner best throw some bleach on the grout to get the mould out.
The toilet door also did not go to the roof and I thought to myself if I were there with anyone else other than my sister I would be so embarrassed as you could hear everything that went on in there. No exhaust could lead to a very smelly room. 0/10 for that poor design.
Lastly the coffee cups should be switched for mugs, they were way too small barely 3 mouthfuls.
One last thing the beds had not been moved and vacuumed under for a long time
We were looking for a lost item and had to move the beds and it was obvious they dont VAC under there. Also we picked up two large pieces of bubble wrap that was under one bed.

Fort Canning Park is also close by and well worth a visit. For those that appreciate history at all the Battle Box tour at Fort Canning Park was excellent; but it also worth a visit for the gardens alone.
The staff were very attentive and friendly; could not be faulted. In February we mentioned that we would be arriving early in the morning on our return in March and wondered whether there was anywhere to have a shower etc. They said they would make a note of it.

Did not try the breakfast buffet, but it looked good although you have many options within walking distance of the hotel.

Our biggest issue was the bathroom which is not in a separate room but a stall created behind the mirror and bathroom sink. This means when you step out of the shower or toilet you are could be in full view of other occupants in the room. It also means that you can clearly hear ""everything"" your partner does if she goes to the toilet in the middle of the night. Also had a problem with the drains as periodic gas cause some back-flow in the floor drains.

We did a 2 day 'hop on hop off tour which was good value, informative and showed us most of the highlights of the island.We found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, the rooms beautifully appointed,  (a little squeezy, but fine) clean and quiet.  The buffet breakfasts were good.  A tip - make sure to book at reception first, because if you just 'walk in' it is dearer.  A extra 'bonus' is the smart phone issued at no charge to guests, with free calls to mobiles and landlines in 10 countries. Nice touch.

We opted for a Merchant room and were pleased with our choice. Not the largest room but enough space for 2 people and 2 suitcases. The window seat was nice especially we the room over looked the pool. The room was serviced everyday with fresh bottles of water which was a nice touch. Excellent shower. The frosted shower and toilet glass doors were not an issue, the bathroom mirror, sink etc are between the shower and the main bedroom so it's really not an issue.
The handy phone is excellent! Loved being able to look at maps, attractions while we were out and about. Plus we saved quite a bit of money by booking tickets on the handy phone. A fantastic addition to the stay.
We had breakfast in the hotel once, it was ok but we opted to eat elsewhere as we didn't think it was that great for the cost.
The pool was very welcome after hot days sightseeing! So nice to cool down, we never had a problem getting loungers. Towels are provided.
All staff were so friendly and helpful.
The hotel is in a great location, Clarke Quay just across the river and Robertson Quay (far nicer in our opinion) is not that far either. So many restaurants and bars along the river and China Town just behind the hotel too.

Date of stay: February 2017,Mlag89,4th time visit and disappointed.,"This was my 4th stay at the Park Regis Singapore. I stayed for 10 nights (business trip). My previous 3 stays were satisfying, unfortunately the quality of this stay was below average. I stayed in 2 rooms (705 - overlooking mosque & 733 - city view).

The good:
1. As usual the staff are very helpful and friendly.
2. The hotel room is a comfortable size, with a comfortable bed.
3. Hotel facilities are great, including pool. gym & bike hire.
4. Great location !

The bad:

1. I was staying on level 7 facing the mosque. Early morning prayer service woke me up at 6am every morning, including Sat & Sun. I would suggest staying in a pool or city view room (for a higher price). I was able to move rooms
2. Air conditioner temperature control - if the aircon was set to 23 degrees, the room would be warm. If the aircon was set to 22 degrees, the room would be freezing. Quite annoying waking up and changing aircon settings during the night.
3. Shower exhaust fan does not turn off and cannot be turned off. It was quite loud and irritating when trying to sleep. Hotel staff were accommodating in allowing me to hear the exhaust fan in other rooms (which I could of moved to). The 3 rooms I was shown also had a loud exhaust fan.
4. Staywell loyalty program - DO NOT BOTHER unless you book the accommodation through the stay well website.
5. If you do not book breakfast the night before through reception, you will be charged an additional $5-7 tax. To be honest I was busy during the day and booking breakfast was the last thing on my mind after a long day.

Overall, great facilities, great location and friendly staff. Quality of the hotel rooms have declined since my first stay in 2015. I hope management can fix these quality / process issues.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Sydney, Australia",20 ,8 ,2.0,

Hotel and rooms clean and modern and within easy walking distance of Clarke quay, china town, marina bay and the MRT station.
Only negative was the grossly expensive (£16pp) but VERY disappointing breakfast. Little choice, lots of empty food stations, indifferent staff members.

Excellent service from check-in to check-out and i may add that cleaning lady on 6th Fl very thoughtful, she gave me extra bottled water (yes, i know SG tap water safe to drink) she said i can bring bottled water when i go out. No dry skin and i remained hydrated lol. I took nothing from mini bar but from pricelist it seems not overly expensive. Room is well designed, love the window seat, and big enough for me. Seriously, i've nothing bad to say about this hotel. In fact, pity i didnt have time to use their pool or try their breakfast buffet. Conclusion, definitely will return to this hotel again",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Jakarta, Indonesia",51 ,7 ,,4.0

Date of stay: January 2017,mrsvye,Enjoyable stay at Park Regis,"Stayed for 4 nights with my husband, third trip to Singapore. Hotel is in a great location - close to Clarke Quay MRT and short walk to Clarke Quay and Chinatown. We booked a smaller room (lvl 3) for a great price - air con was strong, bed very comfortable, international electric plug available, internet was fast and we had a nice view of the hotel pool. Only downside was due to the small room there was no bathroom but a shower stall and toilet stall which didn't leave much to the imagination and would not be recommended for those who prefer privacy. We were also provided with a free handy mobile phone to take with you with access to google maps, internet, standard phone calls and discount tickets such as universal studios which was a fantastic bonus! I would though recommend they install FB messenger as this is how we usually stay in touch with people while overseas. Pool and gym available and staff were friendly. Last but not least is after check out (12PM) they offer guests free luggage minding and  shower/ towel facility to clean up when you pick up your things, as we did as we had a night flight out. It was great to be able to clean up after one last muggy Singapore day of fun.

The staff from check in to check out were lovely. However the best thing about this hotel were the little details that they got right. There was a free phone in the room for local and even some international calls - we were able to call family back in Australia for free. also the phone can be taken so you have google maps and info while exploring Singapore.  They gave us a 2pm late check out free of charge and gave us a card so we could go to the pool and shower before our evening flight. the breakfast bar had a good selection of choices which also changed daily so you won't get sick of the same things on the buffet. They also leant us an umbrella when it got monsoonal - free of charge as well. Those little details where they didn't charge will mean we will definitely be back again when next in Singapore.

Date of stay: November 2016,ClearBrightJade,"""Pleasant and comfortable, wonderful staff""","I remember this hotel from a previous life of quick overnight trips to Singapore for meetings at our company's regional hub. The clearest memories are of early morning breakfasts facing a driveway and compact rooms that we thought had no closets (cleverly disguised by full-length sliding mirror doors).  Thisn time the room came with a mobile phone service (HANDY brand), that allowed us to use data while outside the hotel.   The hotel's location is perfect if you have to do work and catch up on play in a single visit.  If your satisfaction with a hotel ties in with floor area,  then this is not the place for you.  Having that as your main metric will mean you will miss out on excellent facilities,  and excellent service. That doesn't mean it's perfect, my towel was heavily frayed on a vertical edge, but the service does make you want to come back again and again.  The reception staff as well as the concierge are polite, knowledgeable and efficient.  I appreciated, too, the hotel's policy on storing food.  Many years back we had so much food to take home, and requested a top hotel in Singapore to store the items for us before our departure and they refused for fear of contaminating their own stock.  The hotel made quick action of my request, giving me a return card so I could claim my Ayam Buah Keluak from their freezer on my departure.  The breakfast buffet while not vast and expansive is good and reliable, with something for everyone.  It is also a quick 5-minute cross-over to Clarke Quay, so there's a wealth of dining options at just a cross of a bridge.

The location was fabulous, although hot we walked from the hotel to many sights: Lau Pa Sat for dinner, Orchard Road for shopping, the Singapore Flyer, the Merlion, Raffles Hotel Long Bar. If walking isn't for you then the Clarke Quay MRT station is directly across the road, it's the North East line which makes for quick and easy access to Sentosa, only 3 stops to Harbourfront from where you can catch the Sentosa Express or walk across the board walk to Sentosa Island.
The hotel provides you with 'Handy' a 4G enabled smart phone for use throughout your stay, I have never come across this before and it's a great idea! We could make local calls, access Google and Google Maps while out and about and much more! There is also a 'Tickets' app where you can purchase discounted tickets to attractions and use Handy to display your electronic ticket. We bought discounted tickets to Universal Studios and the Cable Car over to Sentosa.
We didn't have breakfast included with our room, we tried two places on New Bridge Road (5 mins from the hotel) which were basic but good: Wanna Cuppa (Western) and Teh Terik (Local). A bit more of a walk and you'll get to Robertsons Quay which has some good options, our fave was the Common Man Coffee Roasters. Fabulous coffee and delish food.

We received a personalised welcome card and a complimentary bottle of red wine from the manager which I thought was a fabulous touch - thank you.  The hotel is in a fantastic, central location right opposite Clarke Quay which is a vibrant area to visit at night with fabulous bars and restaurants everywhere so a definite place to visit.  Terry was fantastic on Concierge and helped us every day with our enquiries he is a real asset to the hotel and so courteous and polite.  Breakfast had a great variety of food on offer all cooked well, eggs were available to order direct from the kitchen and there is also an omelette station for you to have freshly prepared if you wish.  All of the staff were pleasant, helpful and always had a smile on their face.  The hotel does have a pool but we just didn't get the chance to use it.

what they are really saying by charging $200Sgd is ""we dont trust you""... what the receptionist said was ""it is in case you smoke in the room or break something""... seriously... you think that poorly of someone you just met and dont know... way to make me feel welcome after travelling all day!

Then to really put you in the mood to enjoy your stay... they try to upsell all this extras whilst checking in.

Cons:
1. Smallest room I have ever stayed it and it is a high priced hotel so expected better. You feel stuffed in the room which is just enough for you sleep. Access to wardrobe is very difficult due to the congestion.

For about USD150 per night including tax, I felt that this hotel was a very good deal.

Another super convenience is that the hotel is about two minutes walk from the Clark Quay MRT station.

Date of stay: August 2016,Alibozza,Would happily stay here again. ,"Went to Singapore for 5 nights with my sister, for sightseeing. Chose the Park Regis for 4 nights. Price was reasonable by Singapore standards, approx $250aud p/night. Room was very new, neither huge nor tiny. Clean and comfortable. Bathroom had an open-plan concept to the room which I liked, as it made the room feel bigger, but my sister didn't like.
Shower/toilet/bathroom all nice and new, couldn't fault.
Walls between rooms seemed a bit thin as we could hear our neighbours chatting away late one night. Very annoying!
Breakfast was not included at this price. Got the buffet breakfast one morning and nearly died at the price, about $35aud each for very standard buffet food, nothing amazing.
Hotel is very close to Clarke Quay, plenty of dining options and bars, especially at night. Great vibe and nightlife. Also a very short walk from hotel to Clarke Quay MRT. Very easily navigated ourselves from the airport to hotel via MRT.
The reason I like this hotel is its standard versus price, plus location. Comparable hotels were either more expensive, or similar/lower price brackets all looked a bit outdated.

Date of stay: September 2016,Xyrich,"Beautiful Hotel, Near Chinatown, Quay Area","Tucked in the quieter part of Chinatown/Clark Quay district, it was easy to walk from Clark Quay MRT station (taking Exit B Merchant Road) to the hotel.

We were delighted on the news that we were allowed access to our room although arriving early at 11.00am. Check-in was fast and the front desk officer was very accommodating of our last minute request for a room on a high floor.

Booked a room under their weekend wheel and deal, we were upgraded to a Merchant Room plus breakfast for two and a usage of their bicycle (we opt not to use) for two hours.

The room is 20sqm with a queen size bed and an open bathroom concept. Smaller compared to many 4* star hotels in Singapore but the room is modern and the layout was well thought of. I especially like the bay windows overlooking the beautiful pool below.

We went for a few laps in the amazing pool which was on our opinion a bit crowded. Maybe guests can't resist the very inviting pool. The gym which had 3 treadmills and other apparatus is functional.

Breakfast had a good spread of western and local dishes although admittedly it had fewer selections to other hotels of the same class which I've been to.

Overall, I think our stay was pleasant.

I just wished that the hotel have a executive floor with a lounge so staycationers don't have to go out on evenings. I also was a bit frustrated when I found out initially that my booking under the deal was actually for a Park Room. It wasn't stated clearly in the online booking process but Christine (the reservation officer) was very helpful in sorting things out.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",1170 ,107 ,,4.0
Date of stay: September 2016,nakanator,Great for business stay,"Service is top notch from the moment you enter and throughout the stay. The included breakfast buffet is a pretty standard assortment of breakfast food suitable for local, western and european breakfast tastes. Located close to Clarke Quay and Chinatown as well as Clark Quay MRT station makes traveling around many of the major areas very easy. Room amenities include iron and ironing board, toothbrush, razor and assorted toiletries.

The rooms are small compared to other hotels in the area of similar price, but they are kept clean and are well organized. water pressure in the shower is good - very strong from the hand wand, along with a rain-type shower head.

Lighting and road noise were an issue a couple nights. I stayed on the 6th floor and noise from the road woke me up several times. If you're a pretty heavy sleeper, then probably won't be an issue for you. I carry a noise machine app on my ipad to drown out ambient noise when I travel, but even so, the road noise was loud enough to wake me up. The LED on the smoke detector was also incredibly bright. I did not need to turn on a light to move around the room at night, which is unusual. I prefer to have a completely dark room to sleep in. If you only need mostly dark then it probably won't be an issue for you.

The fitness center and pool are open from 6AM, and locks are operated on some timer mechanism which makes we wonder why they can't be open 24hrs a day. I went down to get a workout in before a meeting, but by key card wouldn't work to access the facilities until almost 10 minutes after 6. If the facility isn't closed for cleaning, or waiting for someone to physically open the doors, seems like it didn't really need to be closed. as it was, the 10 minute delay meant I had to cut the workout a little bit short to get showered and to my meeting on time. I guess if they at least make sure access is available at the stated time that would be fine too - but keycard access 24hrs a day would be convenient for many, I would think.

Overall, I'd recommend it - the service, amenities and location are strong pluses. Hopefully the other issues can be resolved as well.",Trip type: Travelled on business,Nampa,4 ,2 ,4.0,

By the way if you are there for the race the hotel is in a fantastic location. It is a 10 minute walk down Boat Quay to reach gate 4. The hotel is clean and well maintained and the staff is very friendly and accomodating. The AC units definitly work and the rooms and common areas were very comfortable temperatures. The rooms are a bit small and if can be dificult to work in them. The desk is cramped and next to the TV so you have room for a laptop and that is about it. The gym is tiny and if there are 3 people in the gym at the same time is too crowded but other than that it is a very good hotel.

Singapore is famous for all things pricey for no reason, here at this hotel it's a gem!! I spent time days and weeks looking for accommodation, not many choices for this category available. Either you trade between space or services. Hotel with good service offer small room or hotel with bigger room offer poorer services. Your choice!! Remember guys - Services charge and Government taxes are excluded in Singapore even if in Booking.com which normally displays selling rate inclusive.  Park Regis is only 5 minutes walk from famous Clark Quay entertainment area and a little further walk leads you to Roberson Quay as well. It's also only a short walk to China town.  Nearest MRT station is even shorter before China Town.  A few station away from Orchard Road.  Hotel offers decent size room not too big but everything is available. We tried breakfast for one day, very good selection for both local dishes and international standard. Mind you breakfast price is not too cheap though. There is swimming pool area with sun lounge on 2F while lobby is on 3F if I am not mistaken. This is not a high rise building. We were on 6F though not facing the pool view. Hotel has rental bike available to explore the city. One restaurant is available on ground floor. Staff were friendly everywhere and they do smile..

After a long journey from Atlanta to Singapore, I was happy to arrive at this hotel. I booked a Saturday night arrival knowing that I wouldn't arrive until after midnight and called the hotel a few days before to alert them of my late arrival so they wouldn't give my room away. Upon arrival, my room was available with no problems - thankfully! The room was very clean, nicely decorated and had plenty of toiletries available. The staff was pleasant and happy to help me navigate the local area.

The bathroom was really different and I liked it. The sink and mirror were essentially in the room and you had a glass door enclosing the shower and toilet. If you need privacy when getting ready, this may not be the best option for you. Breakfast had a variety of items to satisfy any pallet.

Lots of stuff was in a close walking proximity: Clarke Quay, the MRT, restaurants, etc.

Everything was modern, gorgeous, and the use of space was excellent. The staff could not have been more helpful. The location is perfect - very close to Clarke Quay, River Walk, and Chinatown. The mobile they provide is very useful. We had a late lunch one day that was delicious; service was very good. Just a little inconvenient that room service did not start until 10:30 pm. Pool area was beautiful (we had a view from our room) and never had trouble finding chairs.

When reviews say the room is small, they are true. Space is used very well, but one way this is done is by clever use of glass and mirrors. The bathroom is not enclosed in a separate room - simply divided from the sleeping area by a large mirror. The toilet stall and shower are constructed of translucent glass. This did not pose a problem for my spouse and me, but we had considered having our adult daughter (arriving later) room with us. After we saw the room, we decided to book a separate room for her. There really is no room for another bed and the bathroom arrangement provided little privacy. We had a room with a single queen size bed.

The other thing that I loved is the complimentary water bottles that were provided to us, sometimes 4 bottles a day, very necessary for staying hydrated in the hot Singapore weather.
We had the buffet breakfast just one day, much like you would expect from any good international hotel. If you are not into buffet breakfasts there a lots of places nearby to get the local Singapore breakfast, Kaya toast and coffee.
I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Singapore.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Adelaide, Australia",55 ,17 ,,5.0

Besides, during check in, staff has issued $800 deposit without any explanation even though the total expense for my whole accommodation is only $210.

But the room is small, I hate the room layout and design (how the toilet is not separated from your room). My toilet is very stuffy and smells like a $20 B&B's toilet. No ventilation, when I open the toilet door to make it less stuffy, my whole room stinks. Hair dryer is so weak that it barely works.

Date of stay: July 2016,Peneroka,Great location and service,"This hotel is located close to Clark Quay and most importantly within 5 minutes walk to Clark Quay MRT Station and 10 minutes walk to Chinatown. It is wise to base yourself here if you are staying for a few days and planned to see Singapore. Tip: Take the MRT to Chinatown or Orchard Road (shopping district).

The hotel ticks all boxes in terms of quality of service and amenities. Free Wifi throughout the hotel without having to sign in. What stands out here is the little mobile device, similar to a mobile phone, that you can bring with you when travelling around Singapore. It is powered by Android, has a 4G mobile signal, and acts as your personal digital concierge. You can also make FREE calls to a number of countries including Australia and USA. I thought this was a brilliant idea and I have not seen this service or device in any other hotels I've been to.

I was given a room facing the pool. The room was compact but with the clever design gave a spacious impression. The seat by the window was a great place to relax and do some reading. Since it is by the window facing the pool, you can imagine yourself sitting close to the pool without the heat and humidity! The hotel room was well planned. A separate shower and toilet with an open plan sink serve well for a couple with different bathroom needs.

The staff are professional yet very friendly and we could not fault the service. Our only negative comment relates to the buffet offered by the restaurant, but that could be because our understanding of a buffet in Australia is quite different. We did not realise that the buffet required us to select items from the menu which were then cooked especially for us.

Date of stay: April 2016,Eric-travelspecs,"Poor experience, not recommended for business travel","I staid at the hotel for 2 consecutive weeks in a very small room. Upon request to be moved to a more convenient room. The hotel refused and suggested I do an expensive upgrade. I could understand that for a weekend, but not for a 2 consecutive weeks stay spending over €2000.

Secondly, I have sent a pair of handmade business pants to the hotel's dry cleaning service as I have done several times before. Instead of dry cleaning the pants the hotel washed the pants in the laundry machine and ironed them as jeans, removing the front folding. As a result the pants had shrunk and cannot be worn. As I only discovered when I returned home I filed an inquiry and complaint. While the hotel first admitted it was their mistake the hotel manager started to search for excuses with incoherent argumentation leaving me in stuck with a discussion with their laundry service who have confused my order. The hotel is not willing to compensate me fairly for the ruined pants.

The hotel itself is decent. Rooms as mentioned are small and I must say rather awkward as the toilet is almost next to the bed (and not sound proof), but at least the hotel is clean and the pool is nice.

While claiming advocacy of customer service the hotel management completely misses the essence of customer centricity and clings onto to their policies rather than trying to provide a comfortable stay for their clients.

I am very appalled by the handling of the issues by the hotel management and will not be returning here.

Check in was quite fast & easy - the reception was at 3rd floor rather than the 1st floor. The staff were friendly & we were well greeted. They also responded well to our requests. We were pleasantly surprised by the card and welcome gift at our door shortly after we checked in. Another plus point was that the hotel provided a smart phone in the room for us to surf & bring out - think it'll be great for tourists without a local mobile. Wifi in the hotel was easy to connect too.
The room was cosy - I liked the bay window area where we could just sit & relax & enjoy the view. Our room had a balcony & the view was good too. The bed was soft & comfortable (though my friend who is plus size found it too soft). One thing about the room design was that the Shower & toilet were somewhat in the middle of the room & the doors swing outwards, which means the floor gets wet.

We arrived very late from the airport and was checked in quickly to our room which was strangely laid out with a bathroom in the bedroom which was fine for us but if you are shy you will be able to hear the other person on the toilet.

The bed was very comfy and I had a great nights sleep.

Date of stay: May 2016,Michel H,A nice hotel in the center of the city,"Stayed here for a few days, let's talk pros/cons

Pros:
1) located two minutes from MRT
2) the swimming pool is worth mentioning, not just your usual pool, you got a waterfall and, even though located in the center of the city, it still got that intimate environment without much noise
3) the room is pleasant and looks new, with a little couch next to the window, bed is soft and the pillows are really comfortable
4) toilet and shower separated
5) a selection for minibar and room service
6) the hotel actually has a cellphone with a SIM card with 4G FREE TO USE and to take out, with unlimited calls to local and international (or so it says), in case you don't have data roaming abroad
7) service is remarkable, they're friendly and willing to help
8) lift card locked
9) iron board and iron available in room
10) smoking area available

Cons:
1) air conditioner goes back to 17 degrees when you put the card back in, it's not a con, more of a reminder to switch the temperature back to what you want
2) the curtain does not go all the way to the wall, leaving a little spot for the sunlight to come in, that wouldn't be that big of a deal if not for the mirror next to the bed which reflects that light
3) shower and toilet are not completely isolated
4) breakfast not extraordinary, yoghurt was warm
5) no coffee table
6) doormen not always opening doors, just standing there greeting you and smiling

Overall, it's a good hotel at that price and location, service is worth mentioning, swimming pool is ravishing, cellphone at your disposal.
I would definitely stay there again",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Beijing, China",2 ,,4.0,

Date of stay: April 2016,John A,Average Hotel,"Park Regis Singapore is a very average hotel in a good location near by Clarke Quay area.

Reception: we arrived at the hotel around 10:00pm and we appreciative of the quick check-in process.

Room: the room we stayed in (Merchant?) was very small and can be quite cramped if you are traveling with a lot of luggage. The bed was noticeably comfortable which was very much needed for us. The bathroom (specifically the toilet) was giving off a smell of cigarette smoke. Not sure if this was from the guest before or from another room nearby but it was bothersome. The positive of the room and hotel in general is that it includes use of a cell-phone that can be used for international calls and has cellular internet access.

Singapore is a very expensive city so finding a reasonably priced hotel can be difficult. This hotel is pretty expensive by most standards but inexpensive relative to the rest of Singapore's hotel. We had a comfortable stay here and don't have any major complaints.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,17 ,7 ,3.0,

It met all my expectation for the first couple of nights.  Then I came back to my room during the afternoon on the third day and found that there are tiny bugs on my desk, near the sink area and worst, some of them crawled into my suit case, which I left open since the morning.

In fact, my family and I took the train from Changi Airport to Clarke Quay then walked about 5 minutes to the hotel. No sweat at all.
Lots of options for dining at Clarke Quay. Our hotel rate didn't come with breakfast but there are places to eat at at Clarke Quay Central mall, and if one preferred McDonald's, it is located right at Liang Square which is also across the street.
The rooms are generally clean and modern. I cannot express my gratitude enough to the staff at the concierge, especially Terry and James. They were most helpful, spoke understandable English and were quick to respond to our needs and inquiries. If you're a big group that's headed to the airport, I suggest you ask about their van which cost us much lower than if we had hired 4 cabs.

Always clean and AC worked well. The shower and toilet setup is different. Translucent glass enclosures fill this role, somewhat akin to some of the European hotels. The bed was comfortable and a bay window set up with cushions does add an additional area for rest, reading san d relaxation in general. Breakfast was superb. The staff there are quiet achievers. The quickly learn what you like and when they see you coming make sure that they have done their best to make you happy and comfortable. The food itself was excellent in my own opinion. Despite the small room, I would have no hesitation in staying once again in this hotel. Plus the day before I checked out they introduced a great feature.

The bathroom is part of the main room and separated by a counter and mirror. It works though, although two staying the room might make it a bit cramped. The desk is quite 'thin' so is was a bit harder to spread out whilst working. The window seat was quite a nice addition.

The room was clean, tidy and despite its size well appointed. The bed is very comfortable with nice linen. The room includes quite a large TV, coffee facilities, minibar and safe amongst other things. The shower is one of those rainfall jobs which is quite nice.

The internet throughout the hotel is free (yea) and certainly fast enough to work through the cloud.

The staff are stunning. Very friendly and helpful and seeming to genuinely care. A real credit to the hotel.

A slight downside was the breakfast. It's a buffet affair but not one of the best available. it just seemed as if the choices were limited. It's difficult to put my finger on the problem, perhaps it was just the layout and I couldn't find everything, but I've stayed at the sister hotel Park Clarke Quay and their's was just a little better. Still it was all perfectly edible and did the job for starting the day.

I was on business so didn't do sightseeing, but I did hire a bike from a nearby shop although the hotel does have some 'shopper' types available to hire. You can get to East Coast Park without going on the roads which is a pleasant jaunt.

The hotel is located on Clarke Quay, there is a MRT station opposite, it's the tiniest of walks to the bars and restaurants of the area and Chinatown isn't far either. You can eat almost any cuisine you care to mention.

The swimming pool is a decent length and the gym looks well equipped.

We were quite shock the next morning after pulling open the curtain. There is a big mosque tower right in front of our window. The hotel is just next to a mosque which we were not aware of at night.  Apart from the tower, the room is facing the Ministry of Manpower which is a huge square wall with lots of windows in front of us. The view was extremely poor, not just for us but for one whole side of the hotel room.The twin room is very small. If one person sits in front of the desk, the other one cannot pass through from his back. The shower and the toilet are set up like a wardrobe inside the room. It is not like tradition hotel room which contains a bathroom with toilet room inside. The problem is that there is no separate ventilation installed inside either facilities and the washing area. Therefore, toilet smell and the steam moisture comes out to your bed area . The room cleaning is very bad. We noticed patches of black dots on the ceiling and stood on a chair to check. We discovered that these were dead insects sticking on the ceiling near the washing area. We notified the housekeeping in the morning and returned at late night. The stains were still there. They merely said that we could change room but it was already the last night to stay. We also noticed that their housekeeping staff had difficulties in reading English. Housekeeping in some days give us all shampoo but without shower gel. Even when we called and asked for shower gel, they still brought the shampoo to us.

I decided I couldn't cope with such as small room for 7 nights and they did me a reasonable rate on an upgrade to a much larger room.

The room was modern and well appointed (huge TV) . The bathroom is not separate but part of the bedroom which is very modern but I'm not sure if I like it. The toilet and shower are in glass cubicles which are not fully enclosed - so it's not very good for sharing unless your companion doesn't mind listening to/smelling what you get up to in the loo ! But then maybe I'm just an up-tight Brit and this doesn't bother most people !

Date of stay: February 2016,NorthernNov,"Good alternative, very compact rooms","Stayed 2 nights on 3rd floor. Because of U shape of building I was looking into next bedrooms, as well as over pool so curtain was half drawn all the time. Rooms are ""very"" compact. Bathroom vanity basin is your room divider to shower/toilet. Service was good and food was actually very good in all areas(room service, bar and Asian restaurant in lobby). Location wise, the Park Regis is across the road from Clarke Quay and a 10minute walk to China Town so plenty of options to look around.

A couple of annoying things once you get over the Compact Size...the firealarm light is like a green night light , seemed very bright but maybe location/size of room seemed brighter than most hotels, mini bar fridge is noisy as not hidden away,taxis take a long time to get to you and not on regular pass-by so you have to wait, looking into other rooms is a bit annoying.
On the upside, clean,good food, soft bed, very little traffic noise,great pool to lay and relax in , room has everything you need...it is at your fingertips ..literally..

I find the room very small and tight. The bathroom is integrated to the room,and the exhaust system was not as good. The towels and bathrobes are clean but smell of humidity. The breakfast choices were also very limited..Tv channels are also limited.

The hotel was brilliant and I will definitely return on future trips. The room was a reasonable size for Singapore, and very clean and fresh, in a modern design, however, I'm not sure how I would have felt about the toilet facility if I had been travelling with a partner, with the cubicle being pat of the bedroom with opaque glass doors.
I must comment on the air conditioning, which is essential in Singapore and how responsive it was to the changes I made in temperatures, it was excellent and better than in other hotels I have stayed in in Singapore..
I also used the pool, which was a good size for swimming and relaxing, I did not use the gym but noted the range of the up to date equipment for any one who was feeling particularly energetic.

Date of stay: December 2015,JACOB P,Well located good hotel with excellent service,"Location was excellent with all conveniences and MRT station Clarke Quay close by. China Town is walkable distance. Clarke Quay is also a short walk with plenty of dining options. Good location to enjoy the night life of Clark Quay.

Even though we reached at about 9.30 am, well before the check-in time, the hotel reception was generous enough to allow an early check-in. As our itinerary was very tight, we did an early check-out in the morning, however we could keep the baggage in the cloak room and we were allowed to use the shower facilities before we left for the airport in late evening.

Room was small, though OK with Singapore standards. But, it was nice, clean with comfortable bed, equipped with a mini-bar, TV and other essential amenities bathrobes and slippers. Wifi was fast.

Bathroom was too small and there was no wall between the shower and toilet, which can be uncomfortable for at least a few people. Especially the odour and sound from the toilet will reach the shower room.

Breakfast didn’t have many options and was bit pricey too.

Whenever we required cabs, the concierge team was extremely helpful. Staff were courteous, helpful and friendly too.

Even though very close to Clarke Quay, the Hotel is not at all affected by the happenings at Clarke Quay.

Date of stay: January 2016,londonboy78,Strongly recommended... with a few caveats,"Overall I liked this place.  I come to Singapore a lot for business and I stay in a range of hotels.  I like to stay as close to the CBD as possible so that if I can't get a taxi home then it's no big deal.  This normally restricts me to a few hotels that are within budget and within my preferred location range.  All I want is a good bed, a relatively modern feel to it (or at least not decrepit) and a nice breakfast to get me started in the morning.Positives- Excellent value for money.  - Location is very central for those business travellers that need to access the CBD quickly and easily.- Staff were friendly, courteous and seemed organised and as if they knew what they were doing.- Rooms are clean, modern, well presented (if slightly small but not as small as some others in the vicinity.Negatives- The breakfast is good in quality but it's not as broad in range as you might find at other locations in Singapore.  If you want a short order omelette and maybe some fruit or a bowl of cereal in the morning then it's fine.  Bacon and waffles is ok too.  If you like fresh salmon and capers however then you're going to be out of luck.  The coffee consists of a thermal flask on one side where you can get prepare your own cups at your own convenience and was pretty low grade.- The only two plug sockets I could find on reviewing  the bedroom were under the TV, far away from the bedside table. This means I can't recharge my phones whilst in bed, which I personally like to be able to do.  Also, I have waaay more than two items that I tend to recharge at any given time.  Oh, and when you leave the room it doesn't just power down the lights it powers down the plug sockets too, so if you leave your stuff to recharge then you'll come back later to be disappointed.  Annoying.- I personally am used to sleeping on quite a hard mattress.  I found these mattresses to be quite soft and so it wasn't that comfortable for me personally.- There was something weird with the airconditioning where it kept on reverting to a room temperature of 16 centigrade, which is far too cold!

Date of stay: January 2016,Martin U,Second time at Park Regis SG,"I had stayed here when the hotel first opened, and had a very good experience then.  Thankfully, little has changed.  The room is compact and perfect for my needs as a solo business traveler.  I did have to ask for extra coat hangers due to the shortage of drawers, and the staff was quick to provide them.  Do note that the layout of the room provides almost no privacy from your companion i.e. toilet and shower stalls open directly onto the sink area, which is in full view of everyone in the room!  The 25m outdoor pool is one of the main reasons why I returned to PR.  It's clean, well-maintained, and the surrounding area is beautiful.  It's a fantastic spot for exercise and relaxation.  You get a good view of the trees above Merchant Road, and as well as nearby Clarke Quay.  The CQ MRT station, incidentally, is just across the road from the hotel and very convenient.  My only issue with this stay, when compared to the first time, was a toilet that would occasionally smell bad.  (Please hold your jokes for one minute!)  This may have been related to the toilet's weak flush.  However, this was tolerable enough that I didn't report the issue during my stay.  Otherwise, it was an excellent stay.  The beds are very comfortable, staff is fast and friendly, and the location is hard to beat for easy MRT access.  But it's the pool that I miss the most.",Trip type: Travelled on business,,1 ,,5.0,

Date of stay: December 2015,a380timn,Singapore Short Vacation,"On our 2nd trip back to vacation in 2 years, picked The Park Regis due to the price, location and our first choice was sold out.. It is located across the Clark Quay MRT station and close to many cafes and restaurants.

Arrived at 2pm to check in and the front desk is at the 3rd floor, the process was quick and the staff was courteous.

Arrived to our room in 4th floor, which was nice and spacious. The room facing away from the street so it was quiet and the window seating was a nice space to relax. The bed was comfortable and the amenities include complimentary bottle waters, free Wi-Fi and bath-robes and slippers. The shower was nice but there's mildew all over the caulk and the shower head, which is a bit off-putting. The bathroom and shower was separated by glass door, so you may want to share the room with someone intimate...

The staff for most part was courteous and helpful. The front desk helped print online tickets and boarding passes and delivered them quickly. The concierge offered umbrellas for the day, which was helpful as it was pouring pretty much half of the time we were there.

We also used their courtesy room for shower after we checked out and did more sight-seeing prior to our flight. The concept was great, but the shower room was a shower stall in the pool bathroom or the handicap private toilet, both of which offered little room for changing or luggage storage while we showered, it could have been better configured.

There're seem to be a nice pool, gym and lobby restaurant, which we didn't use.

All in all, it was a pretty good stay.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Wichita, Kansas",72 ,68 ,5.0,

Park Regis looks new and has a delightfully fresh design. The rooms are small, but conveniently arranged.

The service is impeccable and it really feels like a 4 or almost 5 star hotel. The price is very reasonable and you would really not expect this quality in Singapore for such a low price.

Date of stay: November 2015,Judi-oz,Great location and friendly staff,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Park Regis. The first time was just one night and as I stayed longer this time I have waited until now to write my review. The location is fantastic, very close to the Clarke Quay station, Clarke Quay itself and Chinatown. So many options to shop, eat and drink in walking distance. The rooms are small but I like the bay windows and open bathroom set up. If I was sharing a twin room with one of my adult sons or a friend, the bathroom may not be so attractive. Room amenities are good too. If you get a high floor on the Clarke Quay side, the views are wonderful - worth paying the bit extra for. The bed was a little soft for my liking, which unusual in Asia and the pool is large and very nice although it does not get a lot of sun after mid morning. The waterfall feature is fun and it was never crowded.
There was a good variety of food in the breakfast buffet although I found the hot food was generally only lukewarm, and this was at 7.30am. Last time I stayed, i found the dining room very overcrowded and the buffet depleted by 9.30 so deliberately went early. Certainly not crowded or depleted but should have been hot! However, it was included in my weekend special deal so can't complain too much.

First of all the location is very convenient, if you wanna visit the Marina and bar district (along the canal), its all walkable distance (in my world walkable is 15 minutes or less). The room is clean and well equipped, the pool is quite alright and if you have the time, the gym has the 'tools' to stay in shape. The Wifi is free, and decently fast.

We had a 12.20AM flight, so the late check-out they offered 2PM was nice, But what I really appreciated that at arrival back at the hotel around 9PM - to pick up our luggage - the staff, George and colleague, provided us with bottled water and a key for the shower room (and pool), towels, to clean up.

Date of stay: November 2015,mrwoodsk,Glass Bathroom??,"We were only in Singapore for the evening and booked this hotel due to its proximity to Clarke Key.
Check in was fine however they forgot to deliver our bags to our room, had to call down for them after 45 minutes waiting.
Thankfully my girlfriend and I have been together for many years, otherwise the glass bathroom would have been especially confronting. Who in their right minds wants a toilet or bathroom with a glass wall and door??
Clearly designed by a person very comfortable with significant others watching your every ""movement"".
The additional drawback is that the room steams up when the shower is in use. This caused our rooms aircon to malfunction and another call required to get a serviceman to repair it. Which he did in a very prompt manner, which basically said to me, not the first time this has needed to be rectified.
Upon checkout we requested a taxi to collect us, I watched the gentleman call the concierge to arrange this and he told me it would be so.
In the time it took for us to ride the lift to the lobby from reception it seems the taxi request was forgotten.

Date of stay: October 2015,christopher488,Would not choose here again.,"Decided to do a staycation with my girlfriend over at Park Regis as it looks good. All was well at the reception but the request I have made. I have actually requested for a late check-out at 4pm but instead of informing me beforehand that that is not possible, the hotel did not do anything about my request. Furthermore, it seems like my request has disappeared from the receptionist. He did not mention anything about it and had check for me as if it's a brand new request. After checking, he told me that it's only possible with 1pm. So I had to respect the hotel policy. Went to the room and found myself in a warm room. I thought that it was fine and decided not to think about it. Came back at night with my girlfriend and the room was warmer than the walkway to the rooms!! How could this be? Informed the technician and he came over in 5 minutes, rectify the solution and the air con was back. The fridge is another letdown. Left my drinks inside for 2 good hours already but there is no sign of it being cold. No temperature change in my drinks at all.

The next morning, the whole room became warm again. I had no idea what has happened and this was such a letdown for the both of us. We could not sleep as it was very warm and the air con was back to square 1 again. Couldn't wait to check out because of this and finally left the hotel disappointed.

1) Didn't take note of my additional request or make any effort to inform me beforehand.
2) The air con wasn't working. Have they done maintenance to the room or someone who stayed previously did not complain or when was the last time someone stayed?

3) The fridge didn't do its job properly. Putting my hand inside, it felt that the fridge was off. There was even a water droplet inside.

Not so Great:

1. Room design not practical: Tiny bathroom (2 separate areas), sink outside the bathroom area and feel like its a part of the room (eye sore). When you take bath, water come out into the room. Also there is no place to hang the towel (any clothes actually) inside the bathroom. So an absolute no no for a family. Unfortunately we were a couple with a 7 year old and stayed for 6 nights. But it will be great for single people.

2. We were checked in into a room with leaking water jet and the plumber could not fix it in one go and i was quite frustrated after a long drive from Joha Bahru, Malaysia.

3. Housekeeping on most days forgot to replenish the room stocks however the moment i called them to replenish, they would immediately take action - prompt that way.

As mentioned in the previous question my first room appeared to be very clean but there was a mosque outside and I could hear load singing at 5:30am which work me up. In this first room the TV remote did not work. I asked for a new room, the second room was quiet but I noticed that small flying bugs were in the room. An exterminator came to the room on the second day but this did not solve the problem. The light in the clock in the second room was broken as well. I ate at the western-style restaurant and while siting at my table, I could see the ventilation system on the roof was badly in need of cleaning and service. All the staff was very gracious and helpful. This would be a very solid upper-class hotel if there were significant changes to the periodic maintenance to address some of these glaring issues.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Boise, Idaho",2 ,3 ,2.0,

Date of stay: October 2015,Hotelanatomist,"Even in the context that all of Singapore strives for excellence, Park Regis is a standout","I stayed a night at Park Regis Singapore, having picked this hotel for its location, in Clarke Quay where I was meeting friends and accessible (100 m) to the MRT North-East line where I had work. Hence, there is no doubt that I picked wisely. There was not much I could do about the prevailing haze though.

Check in was a breeze in an interesting concept where the Reception was on the 3rd floor of the hotel and entry, manned by the friendly concierge, on the first (ground). The staff were exceptionally friendly, highly efficient as expected of Singapore and even accommodated my requested for a 2-hour late checkout.

However, location was hardly the highlight of the hotel. It has been beautifully renovated with studio-concept rooms (open bathroom vanity, cubicles for shower and toilet). The room was about 20 sqm, clean, fresh and exquisitely furnished with attention to minor details. I had a Quay Room which opened on to the 25-metre swimming pool on the 2nd floor - this was excellent if you used the facility but it also meant that there was less privacy from the public pool. The bed was mighty comfortable.

There was fast, complimentary Wi-Fi and a fantastic TV/entertainment system with access to complimentary digital newspapers,cable TV with multiple free and on-demand channels and Interactive TV. Without a doubt, one of the sharpest HD receptions I have experienced in any hotel.

In addition, the room offered individually controlled air-conditioning, in-room safe, mini bar, tea & coffee making facilities, complimentary bottled water, bathrobe, slippers, and 24 hour room service. The amenities provided were extensively detailed and included dental and shaving kits. The rain shower was good and the toilet was equipped with a bidet shower.

Even in the context that Singapore as a nation strives for excellence, Park Regis is a standout in its location, comfort, service standards and value for money.

Later which i checked online was going for as usual 240++. totally ridiculous. Moreover, i was told to pay an extra 15++ for the upgraded room. I was quoted 289 for my current room and i had to pay 289 + 15 for an ""upgrade"" for the same room?

Decent gym. However, dumbells only go up to 20kg and a Smith machine.

Cons:

Cleaners ring your door of an afternoon to see if u want anything. Can get annoying if u are trying to rest. (appreciate it but also want to relax)

Fridges are really small and dont get nearly cold enough.

Shower space is small but shower head is great!

Date of stay: September 2015,RB78,Great Service; Terrible Room,"I recently stayed at the Park Regis for 5 nights for work.  While the staff was amazing; I was a bit disappointed in the hotel itself. I arrived at the hotel at 6am after coming in on an early morning flight.  While I was not able to check in early, I was offered a pass to the pool, gym and bathroom where I could freshen up which was much appreciated. The gym was small but perfectly adequate. There are 3 treadmills, a stationary bike, an elliptical, lat machine, max rack, cable crossover machine and free weights. There is also a free yoga class offered on Sunday mornings in one of the conference rooms. The pool was also a bit smaller than I expected but it was lovely and refreshing. The bathroom where I could freshen up was a bit of a tight squeeze with my luggage but it did have a shower and a safe where I could store some of my valuables. Upon my arrival, reception took down my phone number and said that they would call when my room was ready.  I was under the impression that, although I could not check in at 6am, I would be able to get a room before their 3pm check in time. Sadly, this was not the case. When I had not received a call by 3pm, I went to reception where everything was ready and waiting for me. While I appreciated being able to use the facilities while I waited, after traveling for 24+ hours and waiting for my room for 9+ hours, even being able to check in an hour early would have made a world of difference.Upon getting to my room, I realized that the other reviews were not kidding when they said that the rooms were small.  Not NY small but not too far off either. The bed is in the middle of the room with a window and a window seat on the right side, a small desk and wall mounted TV in front and the bathroom on the left side.  Please note, the bathroom is not actually a separate room. The vanity and sink serve to separate the bedroom from the ""bathroom"". The shower and bathroom are two side by side ""stalls"" that are built into the wall with frosted glass doors and walls.  The closet is a bit awkward to access as it is adjacent to the sink/vanity. Smallness aside, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The first problem I encountered was the mini fridge.  After I had finished unpacking and I sat down for a moment, I noticed that there was a strange clicking coming from it.  I thought that maybe it was intermittent and that it would go away but it didn't. When I shut off the TV and started getting ready for bed, I realized that I would not be able to fall asleep with the noise. I called reception and they sent someone right up. The facilities engineer said that the noise was normal . I was skeptical and asked if he could please either shut it off or remove it because I would not be able live with the noise. He asked me to wait for a few minutes and that he would be right back. About 5 minutes later, he was back with another fridge. He pulled out the old one, emptied it out, installed the new one and replaced the contents. Sure enough, the fridge was quiet as a mouse. I thanked him and he was on his way.The second issue I encountered was the air conditioning at 5am the following morning. I set it to about 18 degrees Celsius when I went to sleep and I woke up sweating. I thought maybe it was on a timer and the room had gradually warmed up so I got up, changed the thermostat to 16 degrees and tried to fall back asleep. The room kept getting warmer and warmer.  At about 8am, I finally called facilities to have them come take a look because it was so warm in the room I could hardly breathe. Facilities was up within 5 minutes, looked at the thermostat which was still set to 16 degrees and then set up a ladder to fix something in a panel in the ceiling.  After about 5 minutes of tinkering, the air conditioner was back on. The gentleman said that if it didn't begin to cool down, that I should call reception and have them put me in another room. I went to down to breakfast, came back up and the room was noticeably cooler.  I then went to work.  After coming back, the air conditioner was still working and the room was nice and cool.  I went to bed that night and woke up, yet again, sweating through the sheets.  The air conditioner had shut off again during the night.  I called facilities and repeated the process over again.  Facilities turned the air back on and said I should call reception if there are any issues.  The following night, the same thing happened.  When the engineer showed up again, I explained that this was happening every single night. That there might be a timer of some sort that was shutting it off.  He tinkered around again and said it should be all fixed. That I shouldn't have any more problems. Sadly, that wasn't the case. The air conditioning stayed on through the night but shut off around 6am. I called again, the engineer came up and told me I should switch rooms because there was an issue. By this point, I had one night left so I told him to just turn it on and hopefully it would stay on until I checked out. Luckily, I had an early morning flight so the air conditioning shut off about 30 minutes before I had to leave.  Needless to say, the issue was quite infuriating and frustrating.The last issue was that my room was directly overlooking a mosque. There were at least two very loud calls to prayer every morning before 6am. The first was at about 540/545 and then another about 10 minutes later.  While this is not the hotel's fault per se, they could at least warn their guests about the noise or put in heavier curtains to block it out.  Between the air conditioning and the calls to prayer, I was unable to sleep past 430/5am most mornings. The hotel offered a breakfast buffet every morning which was pretty good. Every day they had pastries, cereals, fresh fruit, muesli, an omelet station, bacon, chicken sausage, dim sum, congee and toast.  They also had several warm dishes which changed daily. Those included waffles, pancakes, pasta, bread pudding, scrambled eggs, hash browns, noodles, etc. The staff was always quick to come by to check if you needed anything and to clear your plates away. The hotel itself is located within walking distance of clark quay and chinatown and a couple mrt stops. As it is off to the side a bit though, I always had to wait for a taxi to come by. Sometimes as long as 10 minutes so something to keep in mind if you're trying to get to work on time.While the staff was absolutely wonderful, I would not stay here again as I was positively miserable most of the time.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Chicago, Illinois",135 ,23 ,2.0,
Date of stay: September 2015,jarox,"Some great, some not so great","We did enjoy our stay here, at The Park Regis. Check in rather less than friendly, lets face it, most people have a long flight, so a smile would be nice. All the other staff were excellent though.
The rooms are European tiny, takes a bit of planning for who wants to move where. And the bathrooms remind me of a particular cruise ship- Norwegian Epic (Norwegian never built another like it) Really I prefer not to have to yell- turn the TV up, while using the loo. The shower was tremendous.
My number 1 thing for a hotel is quiet. Well here that was exactly so. No street noise, or people walking past your room. THis was F1 weekend so hotel was full, yet still peaceful.
Breakfast was OK, nothing great not terrible, low side of average I would say. Hard too get a table, so often on community type benches. We also had an average lunch here. Its really OK, just nothing memorable.

Date of stay: September 2015,Umezing,So Very Convenient ,"I was visiting Singapore for a couple of days on some work in the CBD financial district.

Out of the several options picked Park Regis as it was better located to the tried and tested Novotel at CQ.

Flight landed at 7am and was at the hotel by 9am. The Conceirge sensed that I needed to fall onto a bed at the earliest, before I hit the ground. He spoke to the check in staff and despite a 2pm check in policy the hotel gave me a room by 10.30am. The hotel was full up from the F1 the previous day but pushed the housekeeping hard to deliver the room early. Well I doused myself with some coffee to keep sane until then .

Rooms are not that large. A queen size room of about 18 sqm from what I could gather, was comfortably appointed and cleverly designed. Nice bed. Ledge seating by the window. Work desk. Mini bar. Coffee bar and dry snacks tucked under the open vanity counter. My room had a nice pool view.

The challenges. Would I have been sharing the room with then the bathroom use by any one person would be a source of disturbance. The bathroom design probably adds to water spills that overflow to the carpet leaving a damp smell. Maybe the return air in this room was not that great.

Staff and service were fab.

Breakfast - could have a better spread for the price charged. Maybe it should take a lesson from its sister property in Dubai where the breakfast is on my don't miss list. The Starbucks and Toast box at Central are open early and are good alternates. Did not try the Restaurant but the dim sums served at breakfast are any indication, then the food should be pretty good. Too bad that the riverfront dining and entertainment area proximity would mean most guests venturing out for a meal.

Location - 3 mins walk to MRT Clark Quay and 6mins to Clark Quay riverside. Heart of CBD a 20 minute walk. Make use of the underground walkway from Capital Square to Marina Bay Financial Centre to beat the heat.

Orchard road was a short 5 minute (SGD 6) uber ride away and MRT return for SGD 3.10 if you don't mind the walk.

Try Singaporean Chili Crab at Jumbo Seafood, taste delicious (Reservation recommended). Hotel room size is decent (we stay in Delux room).

It’s quite a bit, enough to make it a bad ‘value deal’.
It’s true, my confirmation email did actually say taxes excluded, when I looked at it later. My bad.

The rooms are new and funky and don't offer a great view but the location makes up for it. It's just a short walk over a bridged walk way right on the doorstep of Clarke Quay where there are sooooooo many restaurants, bars and nightlife. The Clarke Quay MRT stop is close by and is so easy to use! Everything is in English, digital, and so fast and efficient! Trains run all the time and are really clean and behind glass doors. It's a short train ride to Marina Bay, The Promenade, Orchard Road....
The pool is another winner for me - it's big enough, has a waterfall feature with tables to enjoy cocktails close by and you can swim a little late to ease the humidity...
The breakfast Buffett was okay, just standard. We slept in most mornings because all shops don't open until 11am so we didn't get up for breakfast most mornings....

Getting there was really easy, just about 3-5 mins walk from Clarke Quay mrt. The concierge at the lobby was very welcoming and friendly, always with smiles on their faces.

We only got the other room about an hour later.

Room size was fairly spacious. Location was really good, just behind clarke quay. There's 7-11 right next to the hotel and another across the street so that was convenient. Breakfast was a tad disappointing as the choices were quite limited and the quality was meh.

Check out was okay. One thing commendable was when we were waiting for our cab and it arrived, concierge took the initiative to bring our bags to the cab without being asked to, so kudos to them!

Places to visit and even sit down with you and give you suggestions. They were very nice to our two 7 year old boys too.

Breakfast was included for us and was reasonably good with fruits, yogurts, breads and pastries as well as hot food options and some Asian dishes every day.

The other advantage is their proximity to the metro station and Clare's Quay which is very lively and good place to walk around in evenings and taste lovely food especially seafood. We were told chilli crab is a must here but did not unfortunately try as had to opt for places where kids wanted to eat.
It was easy to also walk to nearby mall and get our money changed at forex bureau, have a fancy meal at the lovely Fullerton hotel nearby and take a boat ride nearby and enjoy the amazing view of the city.

The rooms at this hotel are smallish. We were upgraded to one of the nicer rooms but with the extra bed in there was barely room to walk around. The beds and linen are very clean and comfortable. We did feel that the lady taking our request twice for more creamer and tea seemed bit unhappy about our request for 4 creamers and extra cups but there were 4 of us!!! We eventually bought milk and stored in the fridge in the room.

The room had different bathroom model which is good if you are staying alone in the room but not practical with family. It's basically almost like open bathroom. The wash basin area is open and shower area and toilet are separated in opaque cubicles. These cubicles feel very small and have no locks inside so with young kids like ours, the chances of them opening the doors when you use these facilities is very high.

The small pool was nice with fountain on one side which the boys enjoyed.

Date of stay: August 2015,Oiltraveller,Good Central Stay in Singapore,"Arriving at the hotel was good with friendly helpful staff. Quick check-in and our online request was taken into account for the room booking which was good.

Didn't take the breakfast option as there are a couple of places around the hotel to have a decent breakfast. It is close to the MRT, walking distance and quick to get too. Across the road from Clarke Quay restaurants and Clarke Quay Central which is convenient for entertainment and going for dinner or lunch if you are in the surrounds.

The rooms have got an excellent lay-out, the bathroom lay-out which was really compact and impressed us as it didn't take a lot of space. The coffee station that was hidden away out of sight and the fridge that is build in on the side. We had a city view over the swimming pool and not any real noise to speak off that we've encountered. Rooms were cleaned well and the bed were super for a comfortable sleep.

Affordable hotel in Clarke Quay and for the comforts that it supplied well worth it.

Bryan- extremely efficient and was so nice to upgrade us to a bigger room. Thank you.

Room- the bed was comfortable and big but with all its amenities and when you add your bags there isn't much room to move about comfortably and this was an upgraded room.

Bathroom- clean and spacious and it's extremely thoughtful for the hotel to provide amenities that you would have forgotten.

Pool- amazing, and even late night it was the perfect temperature. It can get busy even an hour before closing but do not give this a miss.

The location is very good. If you want night life, it's 5mins away. If you want food for the family, head to Clark Quay Central. My children enjoyed walking by the Singapore River, listening to baskers and of cos, dinner. The MRT station is there too. If you want Chinese food, China town near the hotel too.

At the hotel bar Twenty3, we had Penang Char Kway Tiao and Fish and Chips. It was very good. Something I would go for even when I am not staying at the hotel.

For the breakfast buffet, the spread is decent bearing in mind this hotel is not big. There was something for everyone in the family.

Oh, yes, Free Wifi that works! If not just head down to the reception area at level 2 where 2 Macs are available for use.

On the whole, I would recommend this hotel for couples, solo, business even though we had fun as a family. We seemed to be the only people with kids at the pool and it felt like we were breaking the peace while other hotel guests where sun bathing. Throughout our stay, we only saw one other child.

Date of stay: August 2015,Libby M,Stopover with great location & staff that go the extra mile,"We stayed on an overnight stop on the way to Thailand. We have visited Singapore many times & chose Park Regis on this occasion primarily due to a deal, proximity to the MRT & walking distance handy to China Town & Clark Quay.
Staff were very helpful on arrival & we found the rooms quiet & comfortable for our stay.It would be recommended to stay on the pool side of the building. As we had a flight the next day & couldn't take advantage of breakfast outside the hotel, we opted for the hotel breakfast which in retrospect was not great for the cost. The only other improvement area would be to add some lighting to the bathroom & shower area as it is very dimly lit & makes it difficult to see.
The location allowed us to take advantage of nearby Chinatown which was just a short walk away for a multitude of hawker options for dinner,shophouses & to explore the great street scenes the area has to offer.
What we will remember mostly about Park Regis was an experience that was very positive involving lost duty free we had left in the back of a taxi that took us from the airport to the hotel. A special thank you to Gaylen & the concierge team who located the lost goods from a taxi receipt & contacted the taxi company where it was located in their lost & found. The hotel took the effort to contact us by email & our duty free was waiting for us when we returned to Singapore after our Thai holiday.Thank you for your exceptional persistence & it further emphasised why we like to return to Singapore & would like to stay again at Park Regis in the future.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Queensland, Australia",126 ,60 ,4.0,

I know that I said I am aware they have to drill during the day, so didn't expect them to be able to do anything about it, given it was mid-afternoon and not night time. A few minutes after I called they called back to ask if we would like to move from current floor where drilling was to the top floor where we would not hear it. We were very happy about this, and even more so because this done on staff initiative, not at our request. Recognition too to the waitstaff in the casual restaurant that night (12/8).

Date of stay: August 2015,fxds7070,"Overpriced, poor design, mediocre maintenance","A) THE GOOD
Staff:
- Polite, very helpful, very friendly

B) THE BAD

Overpriced:
- Not a 4-star hotel, not worth the money AT ALL
- This seems more like a 3.5 star hotel
- The photos are taken to NOT show the poor design of the room. There is no separate washroom. The toilet is separated by thin glass doors, the shower stall is separated by thin glass doors. The sink is right in the middle of the hotel room. Terrible hotel for couples.

Design:
- Washroom not separated from bedroom. Toilet odor, toilet sounds when the other person is using. Not ideal for couples.
- Air conditioner / heating unit is faulty and not easy to use. Even if you set it to an automatic temperature, it becomes too cold.

Maintenance:
- Shower edges dirty with mildew. Caulking peeling off. Disgusting.
- Slow draining sink
- When I first flushed the toilet, 4-5 gnats flew up at me. There is an obvious fungus problem
- Saw 2 ants within 4 days. Why are there ants in a 4-star hotel room, on the 7th floor?
- Television remote control somewhat faulty / poor signal

Pricing:
- The minibar is ridiculously priced - more than the other 4-star hotel I visited. Corner stores nearby.
- Breakfast is overpriced with a small selection of food. Plenty of restaurants nearby.
- The room costs too much; this feels like a 3.5 star hotel, not a 4 star hotel.

C) EXTRA COMMENTS:
- We saw other unhappy couples, even a girl crying, during breakfast time
- Other couples (mainly girls) complaining about the toilet, which is separated from the rest of the room with thin glass walls",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Seoul, South Korea",4 ,2 ,1.0,

There are also frequent boat trips run from Clarke Quay. There seemed to be a big shopping centre there too, but that is not something which interests me, so I did not go in.
My room was, to me, a bit novel in lay out - sort of open plan bathroom/bedroom. Finding the wardrobe was a bit of a challenge, I was very tired when I arrived: it was in the bathroom area behind mirrored doors. The kettle was an even bigger challenge, but it was there. Having said that the room was very clean and comfortable, with a great view (top floor, overlooking Clarke Quay).
The staff were really helpful and the pool was very good for a city centre hotel.
One tip; if you don't want breakfast at the hotel (about $SG34), I found that all of the restaurants at Clarke Quays were shut at about 9.30 am, but there was a MacDonald's near Clarke Quay, looking out to Canning Fort Park - under $10 for 'English' + pancakes with syrup/jam + coffee.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Leicester, United Kingdom",149 ,93 ,4.0,

I had not stayed at the hotel previously and was pleasantly surprised with first impressions of the hotel. The hotel is relatively new and as such all room amenities were of a high standard plus the great swimming pool and gym.

The hotel is located in a convenient location to Clarke Quay and the MRT, Raffles Place and Chinatown, and a few stops to Orchard Road.

Check in and check out was done efficiently and professionally by the staff without attitude or drama.

The only things I can provide feedback on is that the aircon wasnt working properly in my room and I woke upgasping for air in the night time. It just felt like there was no air coming into the room and the second thing is that the exhaust fan in the toilet/bathroom wasnt strong enough. If I was staying another night I would have asked to move to another room.

Date of stay: April 2015,KeiKurono,Inexpensive convenient locality,"Here's the lowdown on the hotel:

Location: Very good and convenient. The place is a quiet area of town, sharing half a block with another office building. It's within a less than five minutes walk to the nearest Clarke quay train station, near to 2 malls, and several heritage areas. Since this area is already considered town area, going anywhere is very convenient. (4 out of 5 stars)

Service: Didn't have much interaction with the service staff but they were usually polite and friendly. Though not exceptional (except for the staff) (3 out of 5 stars)

Rooms : Amenities are new and in good condition. Cable channels are nothing to shout about. (No HBO Or movie channels). The bed and showers are fantastic and comfortable. (Good water pressure).Wifi speed in this hotel is also very quick. The design and layout of the room however, seems relatively inconvenient. ( note that this is the first time I am making this comment throughout all my reviews.) The lack of a proper enclosed area for the bathroom/toilet might cause some intrusion.( noise from utilising the room might disrupt other users of the same room). There is no doubt in its nice design but the placement of the sink vanity top in the middle of the room meant that we were constantly knocking into things. The open concept of the rooms might however appeal to couple utilisation. (3 out of 5 stars)

Value: Singapore hotels are still relatively expensive. At less than 200 SGD Per night. It's considered relatively decently priced and good value for a central location. (4 out of 5 stars)

The lowdown: 3.5 out of 5 stars. Stay here if you desire a reasonably priced stay in the heart of the city.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Singapore,278 ,73 ,,3.0

Clarke Quay was a stroll down to the lights, across the road and a little walk .The bed was very comfy, but the pillows where a bit too big to have a great sleep. Concierge were good most of the time, although we took our own bags to our room, as no help was offered. Very clean smart foyer, with check in being on the 3rd floor. Room keeping could be improved a little, by way of checking the fridge and replenishing milk for tea/coffee on a daily basis. Overall we had a nice stay and having the train across the road gets you anywhere, in no time at all, which is a bonus.

I only give them 4 stars (coz I can't give them 4 1/2) because of the ludicrous mini bar and laundry prices (I don't get why hotels try to rip you off like this - charge less and they'd sell way way more), shortage of plugs in room, and very limited amount of TV channels - I want entertainment on holiday not the news.

Date of stay: April 2015,TCSo,Hotel was trendy but disappointed with the staff,"My family stayed in this hotel for three days. First, the location was perfect, near Clark MRT, 5 mins walking distance to China Town. Free wifi was provided, as you know many Hotels in Singapore charge for it. The hotel was clean and trendy. Rooms are not small (compared to other hotels).However, there were two things I was disappointed with the hotel.First, the staff was not helpful at all.  I first stayed in hotel and went to Malaysia on the second and third nights. When I was back to the hotel again.  I found one of my properties was missing.  I went down to the reception to ask if the house-keeper would see it or not.  I had waited for 20 mins but still no one contacted me.  I went to the reception again for enquiry but still with no reply from house-keeper.  When I returned the room, hotel told me with negative result. I was disappointed with the staff.  If you lost anything in trip, you would like to know where you missed it and would like to see any possible chance to get it back.  For negative result, I would make a report to Police for claiming insurance as soon as I could.  Why did it take about half an hour for a hotel to find out the answer? It was ridiculous.Secondly, I had to leave the hotel early in the morning in 6/4. At night on 5/4, I asked the concierge to call a taxi and wait for my family at 3:45 am in the morning. I will be punctual as I will go to airport.  When I checked out at reception, I asked the receptionist whether a taxi was ready for my family.  She said I could go to the concierge to ask.  Instead, I thought she could call the concierge to confirm.  Is this the actual attitude of any staff in a any hotel.  I did not bother with her and I went down to the concierge.  The staff did not know I had asked hotel to book a taxi for me before.  She called for a taxi immediately. I had waited for several minutes for a taxi coming.  I was angry that I may miss the flight if I  did not manage a longer time to airport.  A promise from hotel is important to the guest but the hotel cannot cope with it.In conclusion,  if you demand a high standard of hotel staff, they will let you down. I stay several hotels in Singapore (including cheap one).  This was the worst service the hotel provided (for around $SGD200 per night).  I would not stay in this hotel again.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Hong Kong, China",4 ,6 ,1.0,

Although I never used the in-house dining facilities (I ate out every night... it is the CBD after all!) the hotel staff were always courteous and helpful, the ambience is clean and modern. Although I wouldnt quite say the place is luxurious (it has more the feel of a new-style Chinese 4 star chain hotel - think Holiday Inn), it is certainly comfortable enough and by appearances newly renovated.

I didn't make use of the pool facilities, but could see them right below my room and it is a large pool with a full wall waterfall, even by larger hotel standards its spacious! The gym facilities located next to the pool (also I didn't use) appeared well set out and full of new equipment.

The main attraction for anyone visiting Singapore has to be the way everything social is a short walk and everything CBD a 5-10 minute cab ride or 15-30 minute walk. During my stay the weather was kind, so perhaps walking won't be for everyone!",Trip type: Travelled on business,,8 ,10 ,4.0,

The rooms were very nice, and clean which is to be expected, and the pool was great with a waterfall cascading into it, and a nice bar adjoining. All the staff were very friendly with our son, and we never felt unwelcome, as some hotels can make  you feel when travelling with young ones.

Date of stay: March 2015,WorldtravellersPlus,A Decent Singapore Option,"Stayed for five nights this week for work have stayed in many different Singapore properties over the last few years, first time here).  Location was the prime reason on this occasion.  It is a very short walk to Clarke Quay MRT station and n o more than 10 minutes into Chinatown.  With that and China Square plus Club Street all nearby (plus CQ if you really fancy it) there are plenty of options.The hotel is modern and bright.  However, it has a feel of Changing Rooms to it.  It misses a substantial feel to it.  Somehow a group of boxes cheaply tacked together.  That detracts from it somehow, but shouldn't.  The rooms are reasonably sized: bigger than some of the newer properties in Singapore but not the size you get in the places like the Swiss Hotels and Millenniums etc.  On good days you can get similar prices at those.  The pool looks enticing although left too early, back to late to use.  Provides a decent aspect from the rooms that side.  And trees.  There is lots of greenery to be seen.The bathroom is semi open to the room: so the wash basin etc. is kind of part of the room, although there are frosted doors on the shower and toilet.  Still, I perhaps prefer to have a fully enclosed bathroom.  The bed is on the soft side, more to do with the thick mattress cover on the top of the mattress.  This also means that that sheets don't properly fit and come untucked and can ruffle up rather easily.  OK for one...perhaps for two you might find yourself on the mattress as the sheets wriggle about.  Depends on how active you are I guess...also two sheets either side of the duvet is odd.  Again, they tend to work a bit loose and you can end up sleeping directly under the duvet itself.  That is not so hygenic..Ewwww.  Tea cups are itsy bitsy tiny.  Mugs!  All the way!  You want a decent cup of tea or coffee in the morning to set up up.  Not a dribble.Probably seems like a good idea from a house keeping perspective...perhaps the house manager should spend a few nights just testing the place out a bit more.Did not eat or drink there: don't need a full breakfast every day.  Another hotel that misses an opportunity to charge $5 for a take out coffee...easy cash and I would pay.Check in, at 1.15am was not that welcoming.  Check out was much more friendly.Another option for the city...not a burning desire to return.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Singapore, Singapore",57 ,68 ,3.0,

- arrived late after flying in and were told the cost is $217 after their undisclosed taxes and service fees
- room was very small and no real bath room - just a toilet cubicle and showere cubicle straight off room and no real exhaust fan
- window handle broken so could not open window
- explained overcharging to the manager but she would not listen - it was as though I was talking to a brick wall, so eventually gave up and decided to simply warn others to beware of the Singaporean's propensity for not disclosing the 10% service charge and their 7 odd % GST, plus the general inability to see the customer's perspective and do anything about it.

What we did like about this stay was:
- proximity to the MRT train station

Date of stay: February 2015,Ms Shin Ji Eun S,Business traveler,"Due to my business schedule, I had to check in late and check out the next morning right after breakfast. Therefore, my experience and review can be covering very limited areas.
1. Hotel bar; I was hoping to enjoy a glass of good cocktails, but the bar seems to close relatively early.
2. Room service: because everything was closed in the hotel, the only service I could request was the room service. I ordered the simple dish, french fries. However, it was served bit cold and fries was rather soggy.
3. The breakfast: I love the fresh fruits, and variety of the food. However, the food was not heated properly. Considering I had below average expereince with my room service, I was disappointed again with Park Regis food overall.
4. Room: Room was great! Everything was properly prepped. Only minor thing was the toilet room (not the shower room) had the subtle smell that was not at all pleasant. Other than that, the overall experience in the room was great.",Trip type: Travelled on business,Seoul,1 ,1 ,4.0,

Park Regis has been my choice for years because of its strategic location and economical price in my expensive country.  Do not expect SQ biz class service where everyone will greet you by your family name ( even though i have been a return guest for years) the hospitality is decent.  I've been put at room unit 16 onwards several times, which has been great for more tranquility away from elevators and pantry.  Not sure if it's my requirement in booking.com each time, doubt they have a system to archive regular guests' preferences.  It's across Clarke Quay MRT station, which is great for commuting everywhere, especially when getting a cab can be a pain in Singapore.  It's a hidden solace in the midst of hustle and bustle near the Quays and Chinatown area.  Room is not big but functional and modern enough, cozy bed and good housekeeping always made it welcoming.  They just did a renovation, shifting the reception to the 3rd floor.  A better do up at the lobby area now, with a comfortable outdoor chillout corner for smokers.

Date of stay: February 2015,Villamil,Not quite the quality I paid for,"Check-in: had to sit on stupid round (and unstable) stools during check-in - why couldn't the staff stand up behind a normal check-in counter?
Restaurant - what happened to the Suite 23 for breakfast? Mentioned in the Services Directory but nowhere to be seen. If it's been closed, please update the Directory! Served in the lobby instead. Breakfast: not worth the $28 charged. Tea was served from a machine - much better to have just hot water and a selection of tea-bags to choose from. Usual stodgy scrambled eggs. Bacon overcooked - like bits of jerky. No tomatoes. Never before had a hotel buffet breakfast without tomatoes. Needed to cut the fat of all the other heavy foods. Hash browns carelessly thrown into the warming dish, so they had all broken up.
Room: no privacy. Set of stairs outside in full view, plus workers outside cleaning the facade to boot! Had to keep the curtains closed all day when I was trying to relax after a long trip to Europe.
Returned to my room at midday after meetings. I wanted to then relax the rest of the afternoon (therefore issue with lack of privacy), but room had not been made up. Asked at reception to have it done while I went down for (a very expensive) lunch at the restaurant (when I'd actually planned to just order room service).

I extremely appreciated the silence in the room. Very good sound protection and even the AC was not loud so that I slept very well.
The design is pretty nice in my opinion. In particular in the lobby they combined modern with traditional Asian style elements.
Buffet breakfast is at upper end of the international standards which you can expect from this hotel category. In particular I liked the the steamed dumplings as this is beyond the boring beans-and-toast stuff.
Hotel staff was friendly all the time. For instance reception staff proactively asked for my flight's departure time at checkout and offered storage of my luggage.

Date of stay: January 2015,Sam F,"Superb Location, Good Service, Some Minor Flaws","Pros:

* Brilliant location. 2 minutes walk (just cross the overpass) to the Clarke Quay MRT station. 5 minutes walk to Chinatown. 5 minutes walk to the Clarke Quay shopping mall, and all the restaurants, bars etc. Walking distance to famous central city sights such as the Raffles Hotel - took us 20 minutes one evening to get home, which is not bad at all.

* Friendly service from the staff; whenever we needed help with directions, instructions etc they were more than pleased to assist.

* Housekeeping did a great job of keeping the rooms clean, provided free bottled water.

* The gym is more than adequate for a hotel of this type.

* Comfortable bed in the room.

* Staff will store your luggage upon checkout until you get picked up for departure. They allowed us to have use of the 2nd floor facilities such as gym, pool, and showers after checkout.

Cons

* Our room was reasonably small. After unpacking our belongings the room became cramped and messy quickly.

* Some aspects of the hotel, such as the carpet, feel rather dated in design.

* Rooftop bar wasn't open.

* Pool is very cold - fine when it's the heat of the day and you want to cool down, but not good for an evening swim.

Note on breakfast:

We had breakfast included each day in our stay (arranged at a discount by our travel agent). There is a breakfast buffet which runs from 6.30 until 10.30. Overall we enjoyed the breakfast, but only because it was included in the cost of our stay. I don't think it would be worth the money if you're paying the ""casual"" rate of $30 per head (I think that's what it costs if I read correctly).

Selection of food was fairly limited, although all very fresh and tasty:

* Western food such as scrambled eggs, bacon, chicken sausage.
* Asian breakfast food such as congee, noodles etc.
* Eggs station for omelettes.
* Pastries and toast with spreads.
* Other ""essentials"" such as cereal, yoghurt.
* Very limited fruit selection.

Service was good, we never waited for a table and used plates etc cleaned away almost immediately. Food was always replenished quickly as well.

Considering that it would be over $100 a day for breakfast for a family, it's far too expensive. However, if you're getting it expensed to your business account or able to get the breakfast included for less with a travel agent or pre-booking, it is more than adequate.

Overall, I highly enjoyed my stay at the Park Regis and would definitely come back during a future visit to Singapore. The superb location (and convenience that it offers) makes this property a no-brainer unless you're a brand loyalist to larger chains, such as the Swissotel over the road - or you desire either more luxury or cheaper accommodation.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand",4 ,2 ,4.0,

They built all the cabinets in a smart way so they can store all the in-room facilities somewhere hidden in the cabinet. I am quite surprised everytime I open shelf, I found something new (mini fridge, hair dryer, water boiler, tea set, etc).

However, what I dislike the most about this hotel is the the open plan of shower and toilet. It becomes awkward for non-couple who stay together and becomes noisy when a person want to go to the bathroom and other want to sleep.

Just about double but if you are over 6ft, feet hang off end of bed! Maybe all hotel rooms in Singapore are tiny. I have nothing to compare with, but rooms are v small. Hotel uses clever photography to make them look bigger & better than they are. For £75 a night, I expected more. Poor housekeeping. Dirty dressing gowns, and didn't replace towels or toiletries without having to ask. Really didn't like open plan toilet & shower in rooms and lack of any extract is just a bit gross really.

This hotel is perfect location for visiting central Singapore, very close to Clark Quay and China town. The staff were all too accommodating and only wanted your stay to be a good one. Rooms were very clean and modern and had free wifi. Swimming pool was also good, the waterfall drowns out the noise of the city! Some parts of the hotel were being renovated while stayed there but didn't effect us at all. Breakfast was ok, with a good range of food types.

Our flight wasn't until late evening, the hotel reception staff were only to happy to let us kick around by the pool and use the public shower and toilets during the afternoon and evening.

It was in an excellent location - away from the hustle and bustle but on the edge of Clarke Quay and Chinatown. The MRT was over the road and taxis were at the front door. The staff (especially Michelle, Radi, Kamal and Mani) were amazing.  From our check-in to our check-out ALL staff were so friendly and ensured we were comfortable and everything was suitable. The hotel was in the middle of renovations but it didn't impact on us.  The room needed a good 'spring' clean but in general was good. The linen was changed daily and the bed was comfortable. The pool was fantastic and we had it to ourselves most days.  The breakfast choice was excellent and breakfast staff wonderful (I did want to take Ann home ;) ). We would definitely choose this hotel again - it wasn't a massive hotel where as a guest you could be mistaken as a visitor - it was large enough to have all of the trimmings of a 'chain' hotel but small enough to feel like home - and it was like leaving family when we left.

Located just across the way from Clarke Quay meant we could easily wander across to the Quay & along the Singapore River.  Here there are many places to choose from to eat as well as to shop.  We also wandered even further along the River to the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre & to the magnificent ""Gardens By The Bay"".  Staff at the Hotel were very efficient & friendly & the room was very clean & comfortable.

Date of stay: August 2014,bittenbytheTbugz,Terribly unfriendly venue for parties with shocking service standards,"We booked a quay room with direct pool access here to celebrate our friend's Hen's party after reading an Augustman magazine article on their quay rooms being one of the best party rooms in Singapore as their quay rooms were supposed to be ""excellent for entertaining friends"" with a ""large outdoor patio with direct access to the hotel's 25-metre lap pool and sundeck"". Apparently, each room also came with a promising sounding ""42-inch LCD TV"". Coupled with the fact that the hotel is located just round the corner from Clarke Quay, we concluded hastily that this hotel must indeed, be great for parties as we could just head out to hit the clubs any time we wanted.

Alas, little did we expect that we were about to be set up for a huge disappointment. As if it wasn't bad enough that our hotel room was shockingly tiny with a cramped bathroom with little privacy as the only barrier that separated the room from the bathroom was a flimsy screen door that exposed the entire room to the sound of every lovely toilet acoustic, the so called ""large outdoor patio"" turned out to be EXTREMELY small, with a small table and 2 standard sized chairs occupying just about every square inch on the patio. It was by no means ""large"" and a real shocking disappointment to behold when we first gained access to our room. How were we supposed to comfortably fit in our small party of 6?

Naturally, we decided to bring our party out. But luck was not on our side. Barely 10 mins after we brought our small, quiet party out by the empty pool, we were informed rudely that glassware was not allowed by the pool. This despite the glaring fact that there was a bar right by the pool that served drinks and an empty cocktail glass sitting by the pool just a couple of feet away from us, mocking us throughout the entire unpleasant fiasco. We were appalled but we agreed to bring our wine bottle back to the room as we were told drinking out of our plastic wine glasses by the pool was fine.

After 2 more repeat visits and much obnoxious attitude from 3 shockingly rude service staff who didn't even bother to appease us despite knowing we were extremely upset by this unexpected turn of events or even look in our direction while talking down to us, we decided to give up and retreat to our hotel room to watch some tv, only to find out their tv channels were limited to mostly news and documentary channels. Seriously, Park Regis??? And Augustman? Best party room? When we had to use the toilet by the pool instead of the bathroom in our hotel room whenever one of us had a stomach upset so the rest of us didn't need to be exposed to the sound (and potential smell) of noisy toilet activities?

Needless to say, Park Regis destroyed our party plans, ruined our mood and made us all feel bad that our friend's Hen's party was spoilt by a couple of rude, inflexible service staff and a hotel room that turned out to be supremely and shockingly party UNfriendly.

For a MUCH better hotel around the same price range, go for Park Royal Pickering across the road. They have much better service standards and are so much more flexible and accommodating towards people who just want to kick back, relax and have a good time.

I'm honestly pretty amazed this hotel has so many good reviews. Have so many people not stayed at hotels that are far better? Even if our nasty experience with their service staff was an anomaly, their tiny hotel rooms, cramped bathrooms without privacy and severely limited tv channels are a far cry from what I expect from a good 4 star hotel.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Singapore, Singapore",181 ,228 ,1.0,

Bad experience with staff who cant even communicate hotel policy properly. Ended up with 3 trips telling the guests different information each time.
Its a big puzzle to have a no drinking policy when pool bar was just 5 steps away from the pool. No glasswares when we saw cocktail glasses by the pool left by earlier guests (we are using plastics by the way) It was pretty much double standards and confusing which made matter worse when security guy who got issues with us dint even bother to politely inform us.

Hotel was plush and serene. About 5 min walk from Clarke Quay MRT.

Room was small - actually, it was a bit of a shocker after coming from Bali - but then, this is Singapore so space is premium. As long as you realise this, no problem.

Bathroom was tiny and glass wall alert! It's a good idea to increase the TV volume when the bathroom is occupied ;)

Even though room and bathroom are small, everything was well-designed and all ameneties worked well.

Service was neither smiley nor intuitive, if you are into those things. But it was polite.

Rooms were chic and carefully designed, but small just like other reviewers noted. Not much legroom and can get cramped, but not a total disruption to hotel stay. Beds were clean, liked the sofa on the hotel windowsill. Downside were the bathrooms; could see people bathing as glass wasn't exactly opaque! LG television was large and entertaining, more channels would be a lot better (too many news channels).

Moreover, swimming pool was clean but no lifeguard. Liked the waterfall decor though. Would have liked a deeper pool end (I'm almost 6 feet and didn't feel any part was deep).

Buffet breakfast was an 8/10, quite good variety but gets repetitive if you stay more than 3 days. Overall, customer service was good; staff were friendly and genuine. No other problems except hot water which was fixed surprisingly fast!

In terms of proximity, Park Regis's location is excellent! Rooms may be small, but being only 5 minutes away from Clarke Quay and its MRT was very convenient. Also 10 mins away from Chinatown, lots of cheaper eats nearby. Marina Bay is a bit farther though, but easily accessibly by MRT.

The hotel was accommodating in all email correspondence prior to my arrival (I had to advice my partner would be arriving before me, despite the booking being in my name).

The room was nice, but I disliked the lack of privacy due to the open plan bathroom. It was separated by sliding partitions, with the toilet and shower in separate cubicles (we were lucky to not get the combined shower and toilet our friends received which we nicknamed the 'shoilet' and provided hours of laughs!). However, even with the separate cubicles every noise is audible. We'd been together for a while, so we lived with it, but it would be embarrassing if you're a new couple!

The main problem I had was the hot water. When I went to shower on my first morning (around 10am as I'd arrived at 2 or 3 am) there was no hot water. Not much makes me grumpier than a cold shower! I called reception who sent maintenance up. He fiddled around with it for 15-20 minutes, and couldn't solve it. He didn't indicate when it would be fixed, nor offer an alternative location for showering. As we were going to meet friends, I had to have a cold shower...

Another day, we received a note under our door which we didn't see until the following morning, when we were wanting to have a shower. There was maintenance being conducted on the hot water system and therefore no hot water... We were on holidays, so were getting up fairly late, which happened to be while the maintenance was occuring. Another cold shower for me...

Lastly, on one of the days (perhaps the day the hot water was off) the pool was also closed all day til 6pm... There went my planned afternoon of lazing by the pool.

Other than these problems, the hotel was nice, clean and in a good location. Staff were helpful. Perhaps more notice could be given for maintenance works, rather than the evening before it is to occur.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Perth, Australia",209 ,67 ,3.0,

The bacon was crispy and the dragon fruit was delicious. I enjoyed my short stay. There was some sort of drumming thing happening on Saturday evening somewhere either outside or in the hotel that wasn't so great. They only stopped at 11pm and could be heard from inside the room.

Location is great, just across the street from Clarke Quay with a metro station 2 mins walk; Chinatown also within walking distance.   At the time of booking the hotel was several hundreds of dollars cheaper compared to any in the same area for 4 star properties.  F&B seems to be under renovation and a temporary room is used for breakfast from what I could gather, we didn't have breakfast here.  The F&B portfolio is not significant at all, probably due to the many options across the road.  Room size was ok, bathroom a bit weird and part of the room without being able to close a door so to speak.

The hotel is more a business person hotel but...we still were able to enjoy the small gym and the pool which was big enough for laps and great for relaxing by after a big mornings shopping or sight seeing. Dinner was close by in Chinatown. Chinatown point shopping centre was close too.
Staff were extremely helpful and courteous going the extra mile whenever it was needed to help.
breakfasts in the breakfast room was great with lots of choice.
Décor was quite dark in the hallways, doors very large and as they shut the noise echoed down the hallways. See though shower and toilet cubicles meant that you had to be sharing with someone you knew well...really well.

The double bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows.  The things that could be improved is the toilet door, which kept slamming (when I was just closing) and the actual room door, which I had to push quite hard to shut - a couple of times, I just walked in to the room and thought I had shut the door, but it was simply ajar.  Never experienced that in a hotel before - so make sure you have shut the door completely.   The location is very close to CLarke Quay and the MRT station.

Ultimate attraction about this hotel is location. It's really near Clarke Quay and China Town. The MRT is only 5 minutes away, across the hotel.

The check in and out is very smooth, while the breakfast is quite delicious.

And I got a complimentary upgrade, yippe, to Merchant Room. The room is quite small, but I guess that happens in all Singapore's hotel.

While there are some room for improvement :
- there's a little change of breakfast choice (in the restaurant) from day to day.
- because near the clark quay where the night activities happen, it's a quite noisy in night. You can still hear the pub music from your room (I stayed in room 335).
- little mishap in room service : forgot to clean the room (on May 15th) and forgot to add shower gel. Unfortunately, I just found that was running out of shower gel when I was in a shower :D.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Jakarta, Indonesia",224 ,165 ,3.0,

Staff were swift efficient and did my check in in the room (thank you). Rooms were snug and cleverly laid out to maximise the space though that does mean you fog up the outside mirror and its a bit humid for a bit after you shower.

Morning start with a trip to the gym which was adequate, pool was also nice but warning to those with poolside rooms - yes we can see you from the pool and from the restaurant!!

Had buffet breakfast at restaurant which was lovely though a bit pricey though my companions were a bit disappointed that the tea wasn't home brewed but one of those machine ones.

Then out on the town and so convenient because we could nip back to the hotel regularly. We went a busy weekend after Easter so it was at the pricier side of the spectrum but was a decent stay.

It just got better from there. I borrowed an adaptor but it turned out my power cord wasn't working so they charged my iPhone for me in the lobby while I ate breakfast the next morning. Helped with cabs and directions, offered me an umbrella on a cloudy evening, and on and on.

The room was small but lovely and had everything you could want. It was so well-designed that tucked away in mirrored drawers I found the kettle and cups for coffee/tea and tucked into mirrored panels was the closet containing robes and slippers.

Date of stay: March 2014,DJH-in-Austin,"Great Facility, Service, Location, and Value!","I stay at a lot of hotels and Singapore is a challenging market. For the most part you either have astronomically priced high-end luxury properties or hotels that are merely ""expensive"" and infested with insects, in terrible locations, or in terrible physical condition.

This hotel is a very nice, sort of ""slim"" property that is a good value given the background of outrageous Singapore prices.

1) The Property - It is a very nice, modern design.It is fresh with a lot of nice hardwood, but bright and airy. Overall, the appearance and condition of the property is excellent. I was very pleased.

2) Rooms - I think all rooms on the property are the same size, part of an efficient and affordable design. The rooms were snug. Not as tight as some Japanese business hotels, but not a lot of wasted space. However, after some initial consternation, I found that I was able to put all my stuff away and the unconventional layout grew on me rapidly. I found moving around, showering, shaving, etc... to work very well. I applaud the architects for pushing the envelope a little on the layout, but still coming up with something very functional and comfortable to use.

3) Pool - Wonderful. Full 25 meter pool. Fresh towels. Great! Nice for workouts.

4) Gym - I did not end up using it, but next to the pool is a serious, well-equipped gym. (Not the afterthought crammed into some older properties)

5) Jogging - Over a small pedestrian bridge and around the corner and you are on the river, one of the best places in Singapore to jog.

<The convenience and quality of the workout options alone are enough to make this my first choice hotel in Singapore. Staying healthy on the road is a real challenge and having a hotel that makes it convenient to exercise is extremely helpful>

6) Pool Bar - One of the few hotels I have seen recently with a real pool bar that is actually staffed.

7) Roof Top Bar - They also have a very elegant roof top bar, but it seems to have a catch-22 traction problem, No one uses it so no one uses it.

8) Lobby Lounge - another excellent design. A very nice real bar, sofas, and comfortable chairs positioned so that you can wait without feeling like you need to buy a drink. Again, subtle but masterfully effective architecture.

9) Restaurant - The only thing I had was a Club Sandwich. The sandwich was excellent. I would have liked the french fries to be more of the modern ""MacDonalds"" style.

10) Breakfast - Is served on the third floor starting at 6:30AM. The layout of the buffet is compact, but it had everything I needed including a cook making eggs to order. Since my room rate did not include breakfast, I had to pay a-la-carte which was a very reasonable S$20 (US$16) plus service and tax. The value of this was also very good.

11) Service - Young, enthusiastic staff, wonderful. I got myself confused and thought my shower was not delivering hot water. They graciously sent someone to my room to show me how to move the lever to the other side to get hot water.

12) The Crowd - The guests are a nice mix of European tourists, young business people (one group of young American men and women were notable) and pairs of well-funded young Korean women. Very nice compared to some other Singapore properties that are dominated by oil thugs or arrogant finance types.

13) Location - Over that same pedestrian bridge and walk directly into the Clarke Quay MRT. Total of perhaps 100 meters, of which only 10 meters is uncovered. Very convenient. Don't get on the MRT and you are on the River at Clarke Quay. One block the other direction and you are in Chinatown.

14) Taxis - Since the hotel is a few blocks out of the way and a little smaller, taxi service is mixed. Of 5 days at 7 AM, two days there was a taxi waiting, two days a taxi pulled in within 2-3 minutes and one day the bellman wasn't there and I had to go out to the road and wait 5-10 min to flag one down.

The one small nit I noticed is that the elevators are dark (elegant, but dark) and it is really hard to see the elevator buttons. During the week I was there, not only did I have problems, but I noticed every other guest that got into the elevator also had to squint, bend down, and put their face right up to the buttons to make out which button to press for their floor.

Overall, an excellent experience. I will be keeping this property in mind for future Singapore trips.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Austin, Texas",73 ,103 ,5.0,

There is also less than 100 meter from the hotel to the closest metro and walking distance to Chinatown. Raffles, Marina Bay and Fort Canning can also be reached on foot.

The hotel has an outdoor pool, a well equipped fitness room and room service several times each day. There is a safe in each room and free high speed wireless internet. The staff is friendly and efficient. I even got an extended check-out without paying any extra. The only negative thing is that the rooms are quite small. Even if the comfort and service is excellent you get more than you really need. I will strongly recommend the hotel, but if you are travelling on a tight budget I think it will be possible to get cheaper deals elsewhere that are more than good enough for just sleeping.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Oslo, Norway",217 ,89 ,5.0,

It's not a five star hotel but it's staff provided five star service.  The room cleaning staff are very friendly and gave us as much bottled water as we needed.  But the most commendable are the staff at the Concierge desk.  They went out of their way to help guests, answering questions about getting around and city sights. One of them really exceeded expectations.  I have asked for his name to make sure he got recognized.  His name is James Paun and he really went out of his way to help us fax an important document to Cambodia, making copies for us and faxing it.  He also show ed good follow up.  I am highly impressed with this hotel's staff.  The hotel itself is beautiful, an Art Deco building although you couldn't tell from the renovated interior, which is a pity.

I must mention Terry from the front desk, and James from concierge were absolutely outstanding! James was always ready to help and provided us with great restaurant suggestions. Terry who checked us in was very attentive. He remembered us from check in, and always tried to check how everything was going whenever he saw us. Percy the manager was also welcoming and did a great follow up with an issue we had. On our last day we left the hotel’s umbrella at a restaurant. A concierge member even offered to retrieve it during his lunch break, so we would avoid the $30 fee. We really wish we knew his name so we could thank him. He really went the extra mile for us. This hotel's front line staff are truly splendid! Thank you guys for making our stay special!

What makes this hotel lose a star is housekeeping. The cleanliness of the room when we checked in was definitely not up to par. There were still stains on the toilet, hair in the closet, and the linen on the bed had marks on them. We called housekeeping to change our linen as it wasn’t just one sheet that was dirty. When I pulled my black jeans from the top shelf of the closet, it was covered with dust. I guess they never wipe that either. ..

Date of stay: December 2013,Hament Rai,"Good stay, Good service but difficult access","I must say I was pleasantly pleased with my stay at the Park Regis Singapore :)

The hotel is located at a great location but has a cumbersome access to it. Taxis need to go a roundabout way to reach the lobby and they are not readily available when you want then to depart either. It's best to walk to the main road for better and quicker chance at getting a taxi. It is however easy access to shops, mall and Clarke Quay.

The hotel itself is 'design styled' property, atypical like many of the 'Boutique' hotels sprouting all over the island. Service at front office, concierge and entrance is great. Friendly staff, very willing and polite always. The food & beverage staff lacked the same enthusiasm at the rest but I would not go as far to say they were bad.

The room was relatively small but comfortable. The cupboard and hand wash basin layout is definitely not of the best but suffice to say adequately functional. The pool is lovely.

I do have one recommendation, if feasible, they should put up another taxi light at the inspection from the main road opposite the court. This would certainly direct more taxis to hotel entrance with more ease.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Phuket, Thailand",1219 ,126 ,,4.0

Great location near Clarke Quay (river taxis at hand plus oodles of restaurants) and the subway. Taxis also easy to get and very good value. We'd go back as it did all we needed.

S,Boutique and yet Elegant,"I stayed in Park Regis 2 or more times and they are consistent on the good, prompt service not to mention that most people in this hotel are Filipinas. But the whole set up is actually artistically arranged. The glass wall separating the sink and the bedroom. The shower and toilet separated by another glass wall are charming. The bed is huge and the window overlooking the pool is the best spot. I love their reception as unlike most prestigious 5 star hotels everyone needs to stand all throughout the transaction. In Park Regis, the chairs are provided for both guests and receptionists which make both parties maintain composure and be cool-headed. Sipping a fresh orange juice every morning watching the fall of their quirky pool is my daily morning routine.

This hotel is also strategically located right across the heart of Clarke Quay where variety of International restaurants are located. Watching the back packers meet each other drinking, sitting down on the handrails of the bridge. Sometimes I wonder how it feels like to be one of them.

Pleasant and helpful concierge and reception team. Good Singapore Sling at the lobby bar.

Negatives: Toilet had a sewage-y smell, not v pleasant + had an unfortunate housekeeping 'incident', but this was swiftly addressed by Wai Hong, the duty manager; good service recovery.

F&B service also needs some tweaking. The all-day dining restaurant is currently (temporarily?) located in a soulless meeting room - which should be communicated (but wasn't) at check-in. I popped in for a quick bite for dinner on arrival and the waitress had to let me in with a key card as the door was locked. Ordered a rice with BBQ pork dish which came minus the pork, but this was rectified, although as the sole diner in the restaurant the lack of attention to detail was disappointing. On arrival and again at the restaurant I had also enquired if they served a la carte breakfast and not just the buffet option, and was advised yes, but this was not the case when I went for breakfast. Instead I ordered pastries and coffee from room service - coffee came in a cup (not pot) and was lukewarm, and pastries were of the mini variety and presented on a plate covered in cling film.

Date of stay: February 2014,PhTravelling_Guy,Good... room size takes it down a notch,"Let's get these two things out of the way immediately... @ 20 sqm, room size is just above tiny and Open Plan Bathroom. If you're traveling with family or sharing a room with someone other than your significant other, these two things will likely be deal killers. On the other hand, if you're not sharing the room and you're an average sized person, none of the above should serve to ruin your stay.

With those two things out of the way, what I did like, in no particular order:

1. Price. At just a bit above USD200 per night for the lowest category rooms, the Park Regis was a good deal.
2. Location. An elevated walkway walk to Clarke Quay and the MRT; walking distance to China Town.
3. Free WiFi that worked.
4. The room was well laid out and designed in a contemporary style. The ""center island"" that made up the sink was cleverly designed. For example, the mini bar was integrated into the island on one side and various drawers held the tea and coffee making facilities as well as the hair dryer. The window seat was likewise a nice touch, as was the bed side analog clock.
5. Glorious water pressure and a water heater that just worked.
6. The pool looked nice.
7. Staff.

What I didn't like:

1. Room size. You cannot open the door to the bath fully without essentially using up all of the space in front of the sink. The closet was likewise awkward to use because of the room's small size. Plus, I just like my hotel rooms bigger, say 28 to about 30 sqm.
2. The toilet was less than comfortable. I dislike the sqaure'ish design. The ""bidet"" (hose), however, was a welcome amenity.
3. Road noise seeped in at night and made it difficult to sleep well. The rooms could probably do with another round of sound-proofing.

Neutral:

1. Breakfast. The restaurant in the ground floor was in the last stages of its re-model when I stayed so breakfast was served in the 3rd floor function room. Selection and quality was fine. You get the staples of an American and Continental breakfasts plus some Asian items in the form of congee and dimsum. But there wasn't that little extra that turns ""meets expectations"" to ""exceeds expectations"".

The property is nice-looking with very modern design. There are plenty of lifts available and the door men are promptly offering assistance. The rooms have a nice design, with a very open plan bathroom. All the amenities are of high quality, and the complimentary Wifi works great. The property has a great pool with plenty of sun chairs and also a gym.
Breakfast was not inlcuded in my room rate, and I did not try the restaurant.

The hotel has a convinient location near the CBD and an entrance of the Clarke Quay metro station is within few minutes walk from the hotel. I did not have much time to explore the surroundings, but it seemed like the was not any shops/restaurants/etc in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but with the metro being near is easy to reach places with plenty of restaurants/shops/etc.

We could not have picked a better hotel. The taxi driver had a little trouble entering the hotel, though he knew exactly where it was, he described it as 'not very taxi friendly.' He turned the meter off due to his mistakes, which were only caused by the one way streets traversed in order to gain entry. (Local knowledge problem I guess)

It was very very easy on foot however, we even decided to walk (VERY easy 10 minutes) to the nearby MRT to catch the train to the airport the next morning. Can't beat that!

As previously stated in almost every prior review, the bathroom layout is quirky, though not unexpected - just read the reviews! Travelling with my teenage daughter as a result of this was a little 'awkward', but hey - we're all humans! She loved it actually and found it one of the most memorable places we stayed during our entire holiday!

The staff we found, were brilliant. Every one of them we dealt with could not have done more for us. We felt at ease with them, and very welcome. The coffee machine right behind reception, the fast lifts, the pool area with waterfall (not there long enough unfortunately to use it) were all above and beyond, which we welcomed very much.

We were not disturbed or put out by any work currently being done here.

We made a reservation with booking.com and had a very bad internet connection. we wanted to book hotel parkregis only for one night (only one night because we had to catch our flight (31-12-2013)back home). We made the booking at 30-12-2013 at 8:00 am. We made the booking and then saw we made it for 2 nights :-( . We immediately emailed www.booking.com and park regis to tell them we only want a booking for the 1 night. Duo the bad internet connection we failed in sending.

Then we arived at hotelparkregis and explained our problem. (so we booked at the same day as we arived) and the staff member only laughed at us and said: you booked we collect (imagine the guy in front of you laughing when telling you this) Still not very kind and it could be a little sick habit. (Neither way it's the hotels policy ) End of story: they let us pay €300 for only one night in this small hotel. We feel like they stole our money without doing anything for us because they have the rights to ""collect my money"" ? legaly they can do it but humanly??????????? No in my opinion a note makes your night and will love you for who you are and not only for your money!

So let's say NO MORE PARK REGIS HOTEL SINGAPORE

Very quiet to boot! The rooms are a little small (like in Paris) but for the almost budget price it is well worth the compromise. Very clever use of the space however, we didn't suffer at all. The best part of this Hotel was the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and every communication was greeted by a genuine smile. When we did have a small issue it was fixed promptly with a lovely hand written note of apology from the duty manager (Rudy). There was further follow up to ensure our satisfaction.

Date of stay: November 2013,Matthew C,Very Nice place to stay,"Stayed here for a night on transit back from business in Europe.

First impressions were very good.
Smooth check-in service, very helpful staff in the lobby, and very nice decor.

The room itself was excellent - modern, clean, everything I needed. View overlooking the roof-top pool. And of course cool air to beat the humid heat outside (and some complementary bottled water as well). Roof top pool was lovely for a morning swim before breakfast, thought I advise you get in before the waterfall starts if you want to do laps.
I didn't use the gym facilities, but they looked quite good also.

Location is good - less than 5min to the Clarke Quay MRT station, and only 10min to walk to the Chinatown area where great food can be found. Clarke Quay river area is across the road for shopping, night life, food, etc.

At check out, I was able to store my bags, and on my return, could use the gym/pool bathroom & showers to freshen up before heading to the airport. Very impressed with the level of service.

Downsides:
I didn't get wifi internet access as part of my accommodation package - the price for access on arrival was ridiculous - so if you need internet, book it with your bed. (I could get 1hr free from the lobby, which was enough to cover my basic needs).

but the check-in staff weren't very helpful in giving me a room with a nice view (of the pool) or anything additional even though I checked in at 9.30pm when they would already know which rooms were available and their numbers for breakfast. Also, she could NOT quote me a room rate cheaper/comparable to an online booking website (Really? I know 2 people in the hotel/tourism industry and they say hotels should be able to give you cheaper or comparable rates to what is quoted online, since they save on the commission).
Got a twin room looking out the back instead. Why not make a guest happy and want to return by giving them a free upgrade if you know there are rooms available for the night? At least I got a late checkout till 1pm, but only because I asked for it. Also, she gave me a room very near the lifts. More noise, less privacy.

Corridors also got noisy if people walked past.I got woken once during my morning sleep-in by a room nearby (sounded like it was 2 doors down) - people talking in their room and laughing.
The bathroom toiletries have changed (downgraded). It used to be Molton Brown and now it's just their own label which is probably a cheaper bulk version (They still advertise Molton Brown in their photos).

Positives are: the concierge (was helpful and friendly even though we didn't need his services, he approached us to welcome us when the check-in desk was fully occupied).
The swimming pool - lovely for a swim and a nice size for a city-centre hotel. Clean with plenty of loungers.
Interior decor and the rain shower head with another detachable shower head.
Location.
Bathrobes provided. Large TV although the selection was very limited.
Dental kit and shaving kit provided without having to request it.

This is my second visit here and honestly, compared to the first, I'm disappointed. However, due to the convenience of its location between Clarke Quay and Chinatown and the very nice pool area, I would still recommend this if the rates are cheaper than others in the area.

The hotel was a pleasant surprise for a 4 star  and compared to the 5 star Sheratol Imperial we stayed at in Kualal Lumpar the day before the service here exceeded that.The hotel was clean through out, and staff very helpful and friendly.  Check in was midday however our return flight was late in the evening so we asked if we could have a late chec out.  Reception gave us 2 extra hours and also advised we could use the hotel facilities until our pick up arrived which was very nice.  All staff were also ready to advise and very polite.Rooms - the rooms were on the small side but they were very clean.  The toilet/ shower had frosted glass and was practically in the same room as the bed as there wasnt a wall but a mirror seperation, however for the 2 of us its was fine.  One thing though as the room was so small you need to be careful of sharp corners as you could easily bump into things.  There wasnt much space to move round what with 2 suitcases and 2 hand luggages taking the space.Breakfast - this was averagequite a lot of choice but as we were vegetarian there wasnt really much.  Dishes were not labelled and most of the time vegetarien food was mixed with meats so we ended up avoiding a lot of things.  We mosltly had omlettes, how ever on one occasion we had asked the chef making the omlette on the stand if they could wash the pan before frying ours as it was used for meats too and he didnt seem very pleased.

Stayed here for 3 nights and I must say it was indeed a very comfortable hotel and everything is so clean and new.

But a few things we all frowned upon were the tiny Park Rooms (deluxe) they have and there were 3 of us so we had no choice but to be upgraded (with and extra fee of course!!) To the Regis Room on the top floor, just to accomodate a 3rd person. Price wise is kinda premium-ish YET, there were no welcome drinks (to make us feel really valued) and the suckiest thing would be, no free internet (WiFi) connection. Only available at the Lobby area. This is kinda annoying as what sort of establishment of an advanced country that do not provide all these simple and basic necessities to its guests??

We left constructive comments in their appraisal form (not sure if they gonna take it seriously or not) with their front desk upon checking out.

But having said all that, it is still a very good place to stay in. Location and comfort wise. A return visit in the future ? Maybe. After they have decided not to be too tight fisted with their extra services.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Kuching, Malaysia",264 ,92 ,,4.0

I loved every minute of my stay here. The staff are friendly and courteous and the rooms are beautiful even if they are a tad on the small side. The other downside of the rooms is that the toilet is rather ""in the room"". Not sure how to explain really - but lets just say that going to the loo doesn't leave much to the imagination for your partner. You certainly wouldn't want this being a first date!
The pool area is very nice although the bar was not attended all the time - or certainly not at the times we wanted a drink.

The staff recomended taking taxi's most places but I had done research before and public transport is great for everything except the Zoo's & Changi museum.  There is a shopping centre around the corner and a hawker centre at the Chinatown MRT.  Clarke Quay is also walking distance and was recomended to us for dinner one night and it let us down, see other reviews to come.The rooms are small but well designed, just look around and you will find spaces (eg under the vanity there is a long shelf).  I would say this is only good for solos, couples or perhaps one adult & one younger child. Downsides are the frosted glass bathroom.  We knew this going in so no surprise and would only recomend they change the one on the toilet door to solid or black.  There are just some things you do not need to see your partner doing.  Also if you left the air-con off for a while or turned it up (we like 23C), the drains started to smell.  A pile of bi-carb soda or draino needs to go down there.  The enclosed cubicle space does not help, perhaps an air freshener would be good.  Final issue was that many of the towels were frayed.  They should not be in guest circulation when in this state.  We had about 6 in our 5 day stay; we only request indvidual towels to be changed when they are frayed or after 3-4 days, so we didn't use that manyThe pool is nice and the waterfall blocks the noise from the road.  Sadly there aren't many lounge chairs and atleast one more would fit up the narrow end where there is only 3.

Check in was a breeze and my details and room were ready and waiting for me. The staff were friendly and helpful. A courteous doorman took my luggage to my door and gave me a few tips about getting around.
The room is small with a weird layout. Instead of the bathroom being a separate room, it's sort of integrated into the bedroom, with only a mirror separating the tiled area from the bed. The toilet and shower are like little cubicles that open into the tiled area. With the doors open, there is almost no room to move. Another little (very picky) issue is when you have the bath mat/towel on the floor next to the shower, you can't open the shower door. The fridge is tiny so you can barely put any of your own drinks in. It's also on the side of the bathroom bench and sort of a weird position. There were two drawers facing the bed that appeared to be for storage, but instead contained the kettle and coffee making facilities.
Apart from those little issues, the bed was comfortable with fresh linen, towels were thick and fluffy, air conditioning efficient and I liked the window seat. I didn't use the pool but it looked great. I also took advantage of the 1 hour free internet but would have hated to pay the over $30 per day to have wireless in my room.

Date of stay: October 2013,Kongco,Good place,"I stayed here for 5 nights on my last business trip.

First impression was already good, as my flight arrived little early when I made a reservation I told them if possible to let me check-in around 11AM (normal time usually past noon), I got there little over 11AM and they got my room ready, bravo!

Location wise, it's not too bad as the nearest MRT is Chinatown and Clarke Quay so access is not an issue, taxi is also easy to get.

Frankly speaking I never stayed in this area before so the first day I asked many questions about directions and places to the concierge, they were all helpful and provided all information clearly.

Their room, as expected, not a sizable one but it is just alright (hey, it's Singapore !). My only remarks is the design of the bathroom, they separate the shower and the toilet (so they got two separate doors next to each other) then the mirror and washbasin is situated outside of those two cubicles and this part functions as the wall separating from the beds. Kinda out of the box design though. But can you imagine after shower you have to go out from the box and get your towel. If you travel with spouse or probably your siblings, fine or else it feels awkward.

Breakfast spread was superb, hot and cold dishes. Great variety.

My only complain is no free WiFi in the room, they charge but it is free in the lobby.

The bad

- Must be the noisiest hotel i ever stayed in. The racket from the corridor was unbelievable and was mostly due to the cleaners in the daytime and guests in the evening. Walls must be paper thin. Dont expect to have a relaxing stay here.

- As mentioned elsewhere welcome to wifi ripoff land ! 30 SG dollars a day for internet and 1 hour complementary wifi per day in public areas !!! How generous ! When will hotels realise that this just irritates guests. Wifi these days should be free everywhere (as lots of other hotels already realise)

Date of stay: October 2013,Telegraphharbour,The worst value for money of any place I have ever stayed anywhere on this planet.,"I am on a trip around the world. I booked every hotel in every city based upon Trip Advisor - I have never been so misled. I wonder how many reviews of this hotel have been “Fabricated” by hotel staff. While the location is excellent, a short walk from the canal and most tourist attractions, this is an “Old School” hotel for naïve people on expense account - and no one else.

The unbelievably overpriced room had a bed, a flat screen tv, and in the bathroom a toilet and a shower. Nothing is complementary here, you pay for everything; pay per view movies in your room, $30 a day for WiFi (really? In 2013 people pay for WiFi?), for breakfast you can pay over $22 for 2 eggs! Want to get a taxi… $3.50 service charge. I have not seen this type of extortion from a hotel in 20 years. Less than a block away you can get free internet, and buy a delicious breakfast of 2 eggs, French toast, and coffee for less than $5. If you walk for 15 seconds, you can get a taxi yourself – no service charge.

Singapore is making great efforts to change the behaviours of its population to make a “Clean and Green” city. This is very refreshing to see, as so much of this part of the world appears to have such wanton disregard for the environment. Perhaps the forces of competition will have the same impact and change or bankrupt “old school” hotels like Park Regis.

Overall, it was a great hotel with everything we needed.

I thought the service was second to none, and the staff genuinely wanted to assist wherever they could. The pool was great as were most of the other facilities.

There was one hour of free wifi per day (per device), but we had to go down to the lobby to use it. Unfortunately in-room wifi was very expensive, but then again, who needs the internet on a honeymoon.

The room was quite small and had recently undergone renovations. It was an open-plan design with only a mirror seperating the bed from the bathroom. The toilet and shower had frosted glass, but it didn't offer much privacy. Again, not a real problem for us but it may be for others.

And this is a great hotel, really. It seems quite new, the rooms like anywhere in Singapore are not very big. I faced the back yard and it was really quiet at night.
The house keeping were quite noisy. But I really loved the staff at the hotel.

Having a shower was a fantastic experience; there were 2 great shower heads.
But it is an “open” bathroom, which means the sink was inside the room and the toilet was half open into the room as the door was not fully lengt. I did not share the room with anybody so for me it was fine.

The pool was nice and in the morning it had both shade and sun, so something for everyone.

The location was great, if you walk fast it takes 5 – 10 minutes to China Town, 35 minutes to Marina Bay Sands, 25 min. to Raffles Hotel. I enjoyed the walks, there is a lot of greenery, but please bring extra t-shirts because the humidity is bad. (One of my mistakes).
There are lots of shopping nearby.

It is easy to get a taxa in Singapore except at rush hours from 6 pm to 8 pm. So here you could walk to Clarke Quay and take the boat instead. It will take you to the famous places, Fullerton, the Flyer, the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands etc. It is of course more expensive but a beautiful journey.

I paid 36 Singapore dollars for 24 hours internet.

The pool was nice and relaxing with a cool waterfall, and the restaurant was very good. The breakfast buffets had an awesome fusion of western and asian food for breakfast - omlettes, pancakes, spicy chicken sausages with noodles, seafood dumplings, and fresh fruit. At $30 though it was a bit pricey.

My only criticism of the room would be that the bathroom wall was frosted glass, and the door had a 5 inch gap at the top and bottom so there was no way to close it off - if you're staying with your SO, make sure you feel comfortable taking a dump infront of each other. I also found that the housekeeping staff were noisy, from about 8am they would thump about in the hallway and have loud frantic conversations in mandarin with each other.

The staff are exceptional helpful and the security system to the hotel floors and hotel rooms is excellent.  Whilst the rooms are not huge they are, to my mind, more than adequate with the space well thought out and I prefer to have the shower in a separate cubicle from the toilet unlike another reviewer. The banquette in the window overlooking the pool was particularly pleasant. The hotel pool is a full 25m open air which is great if you wish to use it as it is a sensible length for exercise.  My only criticism was the lack of free wifi in the room and the grossly exorbitant price for wifi if you wish to have it in the room. This is the only reason the hotel does not get a five rating. 1 hr free in the lobby does not compensate. Whoever set this price needs to think again - it's a total ripoff so I strongly recommend you don't pay.

Park Regis had it all.  The gym is good and there was never more than 4 people in it when I was there. Pool’s big enough to do some lengths.

Date of stay: October 2012,Eric R,Best value for money,"You can't get a better price for a better location in Singapore. The Park Regis reminds me of something along the lines of an Aloft property located about two blocks from Clarke Quay.

The lobby is smartly decorated and efficiently run with a helpful staff. The rooms are tiny with a marked lack of bathroom and shower space and very little closet space. Other than that the rooms are comfortable and functional. I was fortunate to have a King room with a sliding door that opened to a small patio that also offered access to the very nice pool area.

I stayed here one night only mainly to sleep so the lack of space did not bother me one bit and I firmly believe that for the price and location as well as some of the appointments, the size of the room is a more than reasonable trade-off as long as you're not staying more than say three or four days. So if you're staying longer than that or are planning on spending a lot of time in your room, you probably should look elsewhere for accommodations.

We caught a few hours sleep then took a leisurely stroll down to Clarke Quay and Chinatown, both are a few minutes walk from the hotel.

All staff - from check in, to concierge and dining room were friendly, pleasant and courteous.   We were also offered a 2pm check out as our departure from Singapore was not until 8.15pm. Great touch which was most appreciated. A small gripe is the lack of in-room wi-fi, it is free for 1 hour in the lobby only. Only other negative comments would be regarding why would you have a staff member calling out  ""laundry, laundry"" rather loudly before 9am to remind guests that pickup time was imminent.

Room service food was also very tasty and price was OK. Stay in a standard room, it was probably one of the smallest rooms I have had, more of a studio type arrangement. The bathroom and bed are all very close. On the plus side the room on level two had a balcony with two seats and a table and a door that opened! There is a big flat screen tv in the room. I tried to connect my appletv to the tv and struggled with that as the controls to select the second hdmi input were disabled somehow. In the end unplugged the hotel system and plugged my appletv into hdmi 1. It wouldnt connect to the internet though as you need to provide a password before the internet access works. Anyway I was able to watch videos I had brought by doing that. The room came with unlimited access for unlimited devices - that was fantastic. Once you start travelling it is easy to end up with 4 or more devices if there are two of you, that was great. The TV stuff is probably interesting for the techno readers - here is something important for female travelers - no bath in the room just a shower ( a good shower though).
Breakfast was good, lots of fruit and hot food and a nice chap cooking eggs.

Location seemed quite good right next to Clarkes Quay (excellent dining area by the river) and a metro station. One stop to Chinatown, and about $SG25 to the airport in a taxi.

To finish off the room had a little bar fridge, shampoo and a few little things like toothbrush and razor etc. It was a small room, I would look for a room with a bath next time though as my wife checks for that the second she walks into the room!

Extremely good location right next to Clarke Quay and right near a metro station for convenience. The staff were brilliant and courteous.

The concierge were some of the best we had come across during our multi-trip and made our introduction to Singapore very painless. The value and price of the hotel were the best we had come across. You really couldn't as for more for the price.

NEGATIVES
The rooms could have been a lot better. Very tight fit and extremely small. Could hear everything in the next room. It is an open plan room with no door between the bathroom/bedroom. I could smell and hear every plop when my friend was doing a number 2. We ended up leaving the room when the other did the business. Also there was no wifi in the room - I dont know what century the hotel think they are in but even the shoddiest of hotels offer wifi in the room!

We both found the staff to be extremely polite and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. The pool was very welcome, refreshing and quite relaxing after a long day trekking the streets of Singapore.

We had breakfast in the restaurant and found it to be adequate although a little more selection would enhance it further. Again the staff were very helpful and polite.

The only down side is the internet. You get one hour free per day in the hotel lobby after that it is $25 per day which seems a bit excessive and am not sure why you have to pay for something that other hotels freely provide.

In the end, we were shown to 3 rooms, which they said were next to and across from each other.  Maybe Front Office was confused, but the room across was actually down the hall and we called immediately to see if it could be moved closer.  Turns out the closer room was available and we were moved in eventually.  The rooms are small, but spotlessly clean and comfortable; no complaints here.  We had alerted the staff that it was a special birthday celebration and they kindly arranged a complimentary bottle of wine to be sent to the room.  We tried to use the pool but were greeted almost immediately with thunder showers.  The pool was much smaller than expected, and only has sun on it in the earlier part of the day.

Date of stay: June 2013,Edward_Xavier_Han,Great Value,"Park Regis in Singapore aims high and succeeds in a lot of areas. The best part is that it does all this while keeping its prices very affordable. It is in no doubt deserving of its 4 star title.

The lobby and concierge is always well attended with friendly staff to assist and greet you at all times. This level of service is normally found in much more expensive 5 star hotels. One night, we even caused a disturbance with drunk guests in our room. In the end, the staff were very courteous in advising us to keep it down. I have worked at high-end hotels where security is normally called to evict people from the room.

On the subject of the room, you get a stylish open plan layout with a free-standing bathroom faucet and mirror. We appreciated the design and it does feel more spacious compared to your average room with a wall separating the bathroom.

As the price may suggest however, the hotel is not without its flaws. We found the wi-fi comes at a steep cost. I worked at an ISP and cannot see why the wi-fi is charged based on connectivity time as opposed to actual data usage. In our travels we found a lot of 3-star establishments were happy to provide free basic wi-fi.

Wi-fi aside, the location of the hotel is also a little further from the action. Fortunately Clarke quay is just a 10 minute walk if you know the right path, and Orchard road is a cheap taxi ride away. We found Singaporean cab drivers are very trustworthy too, compared to most other countries.

My only other area of concern would be the cleanliness of the rooms. I found the glass doors in the bathroom had the typical oil marks from someone's hands, and the grout between the shower tiles needed some attention from a bleach spray. Luckily the monsoonal waterflow from the shower made up for this. You know you're in a good shower when you never want to leave!

The gym and pool area are also worth a mention. The pool is as nice as it looks, and the small gym had all the equipment to keep a regular gym goer like myself happy throughout the stay.

We initially booked this hotel for 2 reasons. The quirky design and open plan in the rooms, and the competitive room rate when booking in advance. After our stay i still consider these to be the best selling points for this hotel. It is great value, and offers a lot to get excited about.

Attention to guests was paid as soon as we pulled up the driveway. The luggage was taken care off as we were whisked to the front desk for check-in. The guestroom was of a comfortable size, not too small nor too large. It was good for two occupants, but if you came with the family, it would
be a tight squeeze. The hotel has seven stories and our room was on the fifth, overlooking the pool
(room category: Merchant room). It had bay window seats, and the full-length windows allowed the light to shine in. It was great for working at the writing desk if not for the LCD television screen being too close to it. Aside from that, housekeeping does a fine job maintaining the cleaning standards of the hotel's guestrooms.

Hotel is quite new, operating since approx. 3 years. The design of entrance hall, restaurants and rooms is impressive: very modern & thoughtful.
Positive: very charming atmosphere due to the very friendly and helpful staff; excellent breakfast collection; smaller size (compared to the up to 5 times bigger competitors, you could call it “boutique hotel”) and therefore very personal (compared to the huge, neighboring Swisshotel much “warmer atmosphere”), good swimming pool (25 m, at least for early (6 to 9.00) and late (21.00 – 22.00 swimmers, the disturbing artificial waterfall is shut down during these hours), excellent location: public transport & jogging options (sports, see below), rates still reasonable vs. competition.
Negative: Rooms have been excellently designed. But architect had just too little space available to make the rooms really comfortable (he used all possible tricks to make the rooms bigger than they are, you do feel comfortable, but space is very limited).
Sports: Pool 25 m rectangular, mornings & evenings perfect for a long swim. Jogging: Leave the hotel to the right and then a 2nd right at the traffic light straight to the Singapore river. From here follow the river to the Marina, make a circle over the “spiral bridge” and return on the other side. Approx. 40 to 45 min., depending on jet lag and detours. Most of the route without traffic. Do it in the morning. Larger parts of the route are occupied by open air coffees / bars / restaurants which may hinder you.
Restaurants: Unlimited restaurants close to the river, lots of open air locations. If you do not need to have the tourist views, try “Real Food” in the basement of the shopping center “Central”. They offer natural, partly organic food of excellent quality which has not been created in a factory, but a local kitchen. Style: Mix of European dishes with Asian influences. Price level: very reasonable (below SGD 20). Do not get confused with the neighboring fast food-like shops of poor quality (mass market, as in many food court-like environments).

The Internet should be free in all hotels, it is such an essential part of modern living. Build the cost into the room price. The mrt is a 2 minute walk as is the Clarke Quay restaurant precinct. China town is a 5 minute walk and is much better value for food. Clarke quay restaurants are around 20/25 sgd for mains whereas other areas much cheaper.
As with singapore in general, Hotel staff are very focused on customer service - they were excellent.

Date of stay: July 2013,Ian D,Lack of free internet and attention to detail results in lower rating,"On arrival to this hotel I was impressed. Service and check-in was excellent and quick from the time they took my bags to the time they delivered them to my room.

First impression of the room was also good. Although the rooms are smaller compared to other hotels, i didn't really consider this a problem. Lets be honest, how much room does 1 person really need? I know others complain about it but personally I like the open and modern feel to the room.

So like I said my first impressions was good, however, after the first day I started to notice small details that made me less than impressed. On the second day and every subsequent day I received towels that had passed their use expiry and had become thin with badly frayed edges. The spout for the basin was loose and would wobble or spin around and the hose to the bidet was severely damaged (Was repaired on the 3rd day of my stay).Plus the steam extractor for the show was constantly on and was extremely loud, so if you can't sleep with a bit of noise then stay away from this hotel.

The other issue i had with the room was that there was no instructions on how to inform the cleaners if you wanted your room serviced or if you didn't want to be disturbed. Most hotels have a door card to carry this out, however, this hotel went with a switch that operates a light but they didn't provided any instructions regarding this. Actually every information booklet regarding the room and the hotels services where hidden in a draw rather than on display for the guest to view as soon as they enter the room (this is more of a poor marketing practice rather than a disappointment to the guest).

Now onto the main reason I gave an average rating. THE LACK OF FREE INTERNET!!!! With Singapore being a country rich in communication technology at a cheap price it is hard to understand why a top class hotel does not provide it for free. Not only was it not free but it was expensive at $10 for 1 hour or $120+ for a full week. This to me is just blind robbery. If you do stay at this hotel and require internet then I suggest that you go to the China Central shopping centre down the road and find the Singtel dealer. From there you can purchase a sim card for your phone at only $15 (you will need your passport). Once purchased you can use your new sim card to purchase a data package by following the instructions. I purchased a 1GB over 7 days package for only $7, that left me with $10+ left on the sim card to make calls and SMS. Now you can understand why it is blind robbery that they charge $10 for 1 hour when you can get internet using 4G for only $1 a day. If you know what your doing then you can even turn your phone into an access point so that you can use the connection on your laptop.

So would I stay again? Probably not as there are cheaper hotels near by that offer so much more and have more attention to details.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Perth, Australia",5 ,8 ,3.0,

The room we had was I think one of the hotels superior ones - spacious & very well appointed although the frosted window shower & toilet situated in the middle of the room with the vanity behind the bedhead was a bit of a spinout.

Date of stay: July 2013,einstein009,"Good but overpriced hotel, can be well recommended, though","This hotel is located near Clarke MRT station, so you can get around easily. However, the location itself is not so advantageous, close to clarke bay, a touristy rip-off area where you pay at least twice or three times the prices for beer, food and anything.
The hotel itself is also a bit overpriced, the rooms are too small for the price in my point of view. I could hardly stow away my suitcase and my clothes, because there are so few and small drawers. Also, breakfast is really overpriced and there is no free WiFi up in the rooms, only at the lobby for one hour per day. Of course, you can buy WiFi to be able to work in your room, but that's a rip-off, too. It seems to me, though, that this goes for any hotel in Singapore nowadays. Prices have gone up tremendously during the last 10 years, so pretty much every hotel will be overpriced in this city now.
The buffet-type breakfast is really expensive and not included in the room rate - it costs 28 Dollars extra. I only took it a few mornings and found that there is not much variety in the food you get. It seems to be the same standard dishes every day, however, well prepared. So if you're hungry and willing to spend the extra money, breakfast is OK, but if you're looking for a change, then one or two times is enough and you should go somewhere else to have breakfast.

As for the good things, the swimming pool is really nice and a great plus. That's included in the room rate, also the use of a bathrobe which you don't get automatically at every 4 or 5 star hotel. There is also a rather small (to my standards) gym but the equipment is not state-of-the art and a bit outdated, so I did not use it. The room I had was on the 5th floor with a view to the street. There is a cushioned seat bench right next to the window front where you can sit and have a drink - I found that very nice and relaxing. You also get two bottles of water for free every day - not bad and very useful in the muggy heat of Singpore. Last but not least, I found the personnel at the hotel lobby extremely friendly - also a plus that you don't experience without saying at every 4 or 5 star hotel. Another great plus upon checkout was, that they allow you to use the showers and the swimming pool again if you have a late flight. THIS really was GREAT service was I was glad to use. Also, they don't charge you for storing away your luggage during the day after checkout when your flight is only in the evening. Some hotels even charge a fee for that! So you can spent even the last day in the city at leisure and then get a shower refreshment before heading to the airport. I found that really great and this is the first hotel I know which offers this.

All in all, I must say, staying at this hotel was a good experience. The rooms were clean and cleaned every day. The swimming pool is really a great plus after having spent a hot day in muggy Singapore streets. The hotel is overpriced but I reckon that goes for any hotel in Singapore, so I guess you have to live with that. So, I would say, if you're willing to pay the money
you'll have a decent, good and safe place to stay. If you're on business travel (as I was) and your company foots the bill, I would definitely recommend this hotel. I would stay there again if on business travel in SP next time. There are definitely many hotels in SP as overpriced as this one, that do not offer the same amenities. So, all in all I would recommend it.
Free WiFi also in the rooms though, would be a real plus for business travellers.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany",27 ,32 ,4.0,

Hotel is just 3 minutes walk away from Clarke Quay MRT station so it is one of the perks staying here. Surprise i found an iron board and iron in the closet, so this is definitely suitable for business travellers.

Across the road and you would be able to party and get a drink at night @ clarke quay, not to mentioned good food as well. Central Mall is just another 5 mins walk away.

I accidentally left my handphone charger in the room when i checked out and only realised 2 hours later, Rang them up and they had checked with the housekeepers and 2 mins later, they rang me up and indeed was left in the room. Glad they did not kept it or threw it away.

+ Room was cozy (have had bigger at Grand Copthorne), but we didn't mind as we're not in it for very long periods of time. But the design is fantastic - mirrors, hidden drawers and cupboard. A lovely seat along the window allowed for amusement for our 3yr old daughter (watching the pool).
+ Cleaning lady (3rd floor) was so happy and immediately gave us extra towels for our daughter. She also took the time to ask how we were and gave us tips on shopping in China Town.
+ Gym is small but has everything you need. It overlooks the pool, which was fun whilst my daughter and husband swam and I worked out.
+ Business centre on 3rd floor has free computer and Internet access, as well as (free) printing facilities. (Didn't discover this til the last day and it's better than the daily 1 hour free wifi in the lobby).

Saying that, it is literally across the road, but you may face instant death on the road if you try to cross it and hurdle the concrete wall in the central reservation. However, 50 metres away there is an over pass bridge.

Room is ""cosy"" so on the small side if you're staying more than 1 or 2 nights. We got an upgrade to level 2, which is the same floor as the gym and pool, which meant our room had access direct to the pool from a patio. Which was lovely.

Concierge is really helpful. Organised day out for us, taxis when needed and a dinner reservation.

Breakfast was TERRIBLE for 30 SGD each. Absolute rip off for coffee and tea served in jugs sitting on a stove simmering away and the food selection was poor. I stayed at the W in Sentosa in March and the breakfast was the same price but equisite!

Overall, I would recommend this hotel. You can save a lot by staying here. My recommendation is to stay here and then go for 1 cocktail at Ku De Ta at Marina Bay Sands, then back to Clarke Quay for a reasonable dinner.

Date of stay: June 2013,Richard G,It was all right but some things felt cheap,"Let's get them out of the way: (1) free wifi in rooms is standard now so one hour in the lobby comes across like you're in a cut off banana republic when SG has some of the best connectivity on the planet. Just include it and stop turning the lobby into somethung resembling a bus station waiting room (2) they should include breakfast in the rates because I know the area and there aren't any wonderful little cafes anywhere nearby (3) I went to the well-promoted rooftop bar for sundowners at 7pm on a Saturday night and it was deserted of customers, staff and indeed booze.

Apart from all that, I'd say it was fine for S$230 a night. I booked because of the location (I usually stay at the Swissotel across the road but their last-minute rate had jumped to S$380 a night so forget that).

Rooms are small but their layout is actually quite clever and they pack a lot into a limited space. I had to call to find out where the bottle opener was hidden and was directed to two large drawers I'd not discovered yet. The full selection of bathroom toiletries including shaving foam (always the litmus test of a thoughtful hotel to see that provided). Good shower. Desk where I was able to work for a few hours. And space in the window cavity to lounge around.

The pool area is nicely design and the gym was also fine. The hotel was busy when I stayed so I could get my room earlier than the 3pm official time but that's nobody's fault. And the staff were very friendly and competent.

Date of stay: May 2013,HahaBoy,Decent enough,"The hotel building looked new and everything looked to be in mint conditions. However, it seems to be built upwards; narrow alleyways dotted with tiny rooms identical in every floor. Nothing spectacular about it, though the room does have a couple of unusual features. In place of sofa, there's a low wall next to the windows that is covered with sofa cushions. The sink is outside the separate shower and toilet booths and faces the bed and windows. They seem to be designs to make the most use of the tiny space.

But what the hotel lacks in space is made up with an excellent variety of breakfast meals. There's croissants, toast, muffins, brownies, English breakfast, various salad and fruits, cereals, milk, soymilk and juices, Chinese fried noodle and rice, nasi lemak, dim sum. There's 3 stations for DIY hot meals: omelette, noodle soup and Chinese porridge. There's rotation on some of the dishes every day. So variety wise, I'm very pleased. The quality of the food is mostly good, although tiny details would bring it closer to perfect. For example, I would have preferred freshly squeezed juice than concentrate. I like the design of the restaurant too. Very bright from sunlight coming through the glass walls, with wooden look to it.

The service was mostly good, though not very consistent (sometimes very helpful and sometimes not more than simply doing their job). What's rather discomforting is one night I went back to my room and saw someone who looked and dressed like a cleaner casually coming out of the room next to me. She apologised quickly while passing me, probably thinking it was my room. I don't really like the idea of a cleaner sneaking into guest rooms, so hopefully it's not what happened.

I took taxi to my office every day (I never needed to wait for my taxi, which lined up in front of the lobby), so don't really know the surrounding well. It doesn't seem to be that close to MRT station though probably walkable. Next to it is highway and on the other sides of the hotel I didn't notice shopping mall or restaurants or any major attractions. Clarke Quay is close to the river and nightlife, so I guess a few minutes walk will get you there.

My stay cost my company S$240 - 260 per night before tax. It's not cheap but probably ok given the central location.

Date of stay: May 2013,Andrian K,"Friendly staff, tiny rooms with weird design","Location: Average. This hotel is right across the street from Clarke Quay MRT (purple line) - use the Merchant Rd exit. Quite inconvenient to travel to and from the airport to this location, as the MRT at least 2-3 transfers. Only stay here if you're going to Clarke Quay, or maybe Chinatown.

The building is very new, so new (and maybe not too popular) that my taxi driver does not know where it is (according to the staff this property is only two years old). The interior looks clean and modern.

Check-in and check-out was quick and the staff were always friendly and helpful (I found the staff to be the only highlight of this property).

Now, the room design: I think it's weird. I did not like it. It's tiny - there's not much space around really. The open bathroom makes me feel like I'm sleeping in a huge bathroom. There is no wall between the bed and the sink. From there, there are only frosted glass doors to the toilet and the separate shower. Totally not suitable for more than one person staying.

Room facilities: has one international style power plug (that fits any plug you may have), however there is no power plug available near the bed sides. Not very convenient for people like me who use my phone for alarm clock (which needs to be charged overnight). The bathroom amenity kits are quite good though (toothbrush, soap, etc.) - better than many other hotels I've been to. The bed is a bit hard, although it didn't bother me much. The window curtain is a bit clunky, there was some sunlight leaking into the room in the morning. Also, the door lock is a bit unresponsive such that I needed to tap the key multiple times to open the room door (first time ever I had such a problem with a hotel room door).

Value: I would say, quite poor. I paid 160USD a night. In-room internet is charged extra. For comparison, a similarly sized room at the Ibis Bencoolen costs arund 120USD a night including free internet.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Sydney, Australia",18 ,32 ,3.0,

The curtain for washroom should extend to the bathroom area, this will keep more privacy.The restaurant for breakfast is good,  As a small hotel, they have a lot of varieties and the Chef always comes out to check the food and even helping to clear the table, making omelette, refill food etc.  Quality of food is good.Worth to have a stay if you are sharing the room with a close one.Check in time is a little bit long but friendly.

We will always stay at Park Regis when in Singapore.  The hotel is beautiful and new.  The customer service is way beyond one's expectations to the point that they will drop everything to help you out.  I had an issue with my knees and could hardly walk on the first stay and they arranged for the airline at the Gold Coast to have a wheelchair and assistant waiting for me!!!!!!  All for free.  The staff's constant smiles and positive attitudes are an admiration and I won't ever forget them.  Their rooms are funky and modern.  Breakfast is excellent.  Pool facilities etc are excellent.

Everything looks new and fresh and the room was a reasonable size.  I common with all Singapore hotels, it is difficult to find value since all the hotels are expensive.  However, the Park Regis was not too bad.  However, their policy of charging for wifi is very bad.  Only used it infrequently because of the cost.  It should always be inclusive.

That said being much smaller the Park Regis staff were friendlier, more attentive and available. In fact that fact was the key positive for h hotel and overrode the annoying lack of free WiFi in the rooms. In fact access was restricted to one free hour per room per day. However, to add to the annoyance, you had o use the whole hour in one go.
The rooms were small and we didn't like the bathroom being part of the bedroom but they were clean and functional otherwise.
Pool and gym were good. Restaurant prices were high as we're the beer prices.

Very convenient accessibility to MRT, Clark Quay, Chinatown. Hotel is generally new and well maintained.The room is a little small but it is not cramped. All basic necessities in the room is covered. However the work table is not at a very convenient location.  The table is right in front of the LCD TV and it is almost impossible to leave the TV on while doing work on the Laptop. Another note of caution. This room is more suitable for single occupancy. If you are planning a business trip with a colleague on a twin sharing basis, the room setup is not suitable as the bathroom is open concept and does not have  any doors or partitions. Bathroom consist of light frosted glass cubicles for shower and WC and leaves little to the imagination. Breakfast at the cafe is acceptable with a wide variety of western and Asian fare.

The hotel is relatively new and is clean and contemporary.  The pool area is lovely - and a nice place to sit for a drink in the evening and the rooms are comfortable, clean and well maintained and it is priced competitively for Singapore.  Clarke Quay and the River Walk is literally a 2/3 minute walk away.ALL staff that I spoke to were really friendly, courteous and efficient (especially those who got me a taxi every morning).

The location of this hotel is great, there are many food places, bars and shopping outlets so close to the hotel, the MRT is also just across the road.

A few minor issues were;
- Mini bar fridge is so small, you can barely fit a couple bottle of drinks within.
- A few taxi drivers had issues locating this hotel and it's entrance (Not the hotels fault obviously)
- The room is rather small for the price you pay for, I've paid considerably less for a hotel in Singapore in the past and get a much larger room.

Date of stay: February 2013,Ty N,Excellent value,"After staying in another hotel before travelling to Vietnam, we decided to check for a bigger room. We found this hotel on a booking site, being only 20 SGD more expensive than the other one but without internet and breakfast.
Well, since the breakfast was not really rich in the last hotel, we decided to book the Park Regis this time.
When we arrived, we felt like doing luxury vacation. The hotel staff was absolutely professional, friendly and caring.
The check-in went smoothly, they gave us another room than foreseen, since that one was not yet ready. The concierge took our luggage, came up with us and explained how the door works etc.He didn't even accept any tips!
We had a window (view was ok, towards the next building) a very nice bed with fluffy blankets, fluffy pillow, fluffy everything.
The shower was nice, the given toiletries were nice. The room was very clean and we felt very good just being there.
We didn't go to the business center for the computers, but they would be free to use.

The location is very nice, China town was 5 minutes away (including the metro stop) and there are places to shop and eat nearby.

The pool in the evening was relaxing, we took a nice swim after a long day of walking around.

We had our flight right after midnight, so we asked to store our luggage for the last day. This was not a problem at all. They even told us that we can take a shower by the gym when we come back, before going to the airport.
We came and asked to get some stuff from our bags to change and they brought us what we asked for, gave us a keycard to access the gym and we received some towels from the swimming pool section for our shower.
This was very impressive!

After taking a drink at the bar, we asked for a cab, which was called by the concierge. They helped us - actually, they carried the luggage to the car, told the driver where to go and so all we had to do is sit and enjoy the drive.

I would definitely recommend this hotel, the roomrate was not much more expensive than other ""backpacker"" style hotels. It's worth the upgrade.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Bremgarten bei Bern, Switzerland",141 ,73 ,5.0,

The business room has computers which I appreciated as I was travelling without a laptop. The staff couldn't let me check in early when I arrived, but they gave me towels and sent me upstairs to the gym to have a shower, which was much appreciated.

Given it was new, everything was obviously clean and tidy. The rooms were of a decent size and I had a view out over the pool and on towards Clark Quay. The location is good given it is only a short walk to the MRT or onto Clarke / Boat Quays.

Date of stay: March 2013,tjakesphotography,Great Administrative Staff,"I have to say when I read so of the review here I was really wondering how well my experience would be at the Park Regis. So let me start off by saying not everything was as perfect as I would have like it to be, but like any business especially a service oriented business you will find out there true colors when there is an issue. I travel by business all over the world so I have seen good and bad as well as good and bad solutions to issues. I have to say when I first called down to the front desk about my issue it was not resolved to my satisfaction. But if I find it necessary to call to get an issue resolved I will not sit back and do nothing till the issue is resolved. So I escalated the problem to management. Because if they do not know they can not fix the issue like with any business. I have to say they went above and beyond. The management of this property care about their visitors and expect their staff to give you the best stay possible. While staying at the Park Regis I had several people I know staying in this hotel with me. Everything was perfect in their rooms and they had no issues. But one of the guys became ill during the stay and the hotel went out of their way to make sure he was taken care of. Other than my fist issues the hotel is a very nice hotel with excellent staff and the location I think is one of the best in Singapore. And one major point is the metro as well as Clarke Que is right across the street. And just a few blocks away Chinatown. I stayed in this hotel for over a week and I went from my first impression of never return to I will stay here again on my next visit. And it was not necessary for me to do and they did not expect it, but I was so impressed with how everything was taken care of and the care I was given at the Park Regis I went out to a couple local goodies shop and brought the staff back a thank you note and loads of goodies for them to eat. In all my travels I have never felt compelled to do this for any hotel, so I believe this says a lot for the car my friends and I were given at the Park Regis.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Owings, Maryland",21 ,14 ,5.0,

The twin room has two very small single beds, just good enough for small sized Asians. The staff were generally helpful, they attended to my needs.

Date of stay: March 2013,NixyE,Great hotel!,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed at the Park Regis Singapore, and although my experience this time wasn't as amazing as my first, I would still stay there again.
I checked in and the Front Desk advised that I had been upgraded. I love upgrades so I was excited about potentially a bigger room. But this wasn't the case - my upgrade was exactly the same room, just located on the 7th floor. As I had been on the 6th floor on my previous visit, there wasn't much of a difference.
The room is brand new and modern. It might be a bit small for 2 people during a longer stay, but for myself on business it was perfect. The rain shower was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.
The staff this time around were quite short with me - not as polite. And when I advised the room service attendant that I didn't eat chicken, she said she would swap it for grilled prawns - but still placed the chicken on the plate with the prawns??!!
It drives me insane when the menu only caters for people who don't eat pork. I don't eat chicken, and in all honestly, the idea of chicken sausage and bacon makes me want to gag. I feel that there should be an option - especially since bacon was originally made from pork.
The location of the hotel is fantastic, with Clarke Quay just across the river, the MRT across the road and Robertson Quay only a 10 min walk away.

What I found strange was the room design. What should have been a bathroom is a mirror attached to a sink, all in the open and behind it cubicles for the WC and shower, again all in the open. Was alone on business but if you are there with your partner, you have little privacy.

Room was fine with a big flat screen TV and desk right in front of the bed, which was comfy, and good fast WiFi. WiFi is pricey though.

Then, shower and toilet are in two different cubicles to the left of the mirror, while bed is to the right. Even if you're a couple, you still want some privacy when doing personal intimate things - well, don't expect that. Also, there is no way to put a towel next to the shower exit, since when the door opens it drags the towel away.

Next thing is that you can turn on the light only on one side of the bed. So, if you happen to be on ""wrong"" side of the bed, you need to wake up your spouse in order to turn on the light during night.

If you stay alone, the room is ok, but if it's two persons, I can't recommend it.

Date of stay: February 2013,WorldTraveller201000,Great value for money in excellent location,"I've stayed here not for business, but rather for pleasure. And I can tell you: The hotel is perfect for this (as well) - while it might sell itself as efficient hotel for business travellers, it's location is also perfect for a weekend day.

It's 3 minutes walk to Clarke Quay - or about 5 minutes to China Town, where Hawker centers, cheap massages and plentifull of shopping awaits you. 2 minutes to the next MRT station. And their weekend rates are trully attractive.

Now, enough of the ""advertisement"", down to the facts:

I arrived a bit early, no problem to checkin 2 hours before the official allowed time, and on Sunday, I had no problem to stay 1 hour over the check out time after a quick call to reception. Both much appreciated.

The pool is of a good size, I love the waterbeds, and I actually enjoyed it being in the shadow in the afternoon - you won't get burnt so easily.

The elevators are plentiful and efficient - no long waiting hours.

Now about the most important thing in an hotel, the room itself: I had the city view room, which is the regular room. I found it well enough, it's quiet, spacious enough while not being large obviously, the TV is large and offers a good choice of channels. The curtains do close (almost) perfectly. The bathroom is of the very ""open"" design, no bathtub but a good shower, which you might overflood a bit if you shower too long&too strong. But this is probably the only thing to complain about the room. The bed is comfortable, nice pillows, the minibar does allow some space for your personal belongings, which is always a plus (I know that I can let them empty it completely, but I don't like to ask for that, unless it's really so full there is zero space for my drinks)

Their service is spot on, from checkin to luggage storage after checkout. Absolutely nothing to fault.

Date of stay: February 2013,xanShines,Great service,"Reiterate Homing_Pigeon1's comment.. The more you travel, the more you appreciate the real luxury of a hotel: it is not in the full-of-gadgets or pointlessly spacious rooms, it is in how you are treated by the staff.

Its really a pleasure to stay in this hotel since it is relatively new. I booked the room on the same day which at first I thought it would be hassle in checking-in since I only have with me a soft copy for my room reservation. But check-in was very smooth, the staffs are very courteous, accommodating and kind. We also met the duty manager Rudy, a Filipino, who is very kind, approachable and accommodating and he even talked to us (me and my mom) for a moment. We are very satisfied by how we are treated.

Just across the street, you can stroll around Riverside point, Clarke Quay and Central mall which you can find a lot of restaurants, pubs etc there

Transportation wise, it is near Clarke Quay MRT station however, if you're getting into this hotel on the first time, it is kind of confusing (as well as to the taxi drivers) because they are going along the Merchant Rd. which is not passable to the entrance of the hotel (because its one way). So you need to instruct the driver to pass along Havelock Rd and turn left to the street before New Bridge Rd. (Really I forgot, sorry. Kindly correct me on this) hehehe

Overall, me and my mum had a great time staying at this hotel.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Manila, Philippines",205 ,52 ,5.0,

Rooms are small but very clean and with new furnishings.

The buffet breakfast was very average and extremely expensive for what it was - head across the road to the Swisshotel for a smorgasbord of food for the same price.

Five mins walk from the hotel and you are at Clark Quay where you can hop onto a boat and cruise down the river all the way to Marina Sands. Restaurants, bars and nightclubs line the riverside, making it a great spot day or night if you want to grab a bite or just relax.

I love a balcony and our room had one – you have to check if you get a Regis room with a balcony because not all have one!

Date of stay: November 2012,KaratheTravelAgent,Overall it was a good stay,"I stayed here with my Mum for 3 nights and overall had a great time. Here is my review.

Rooms; Whilst the rooms are very modern and are designed to make the most of the space, I think they have some flaws. Firstly the are very small which is to be expected however a little more space would have been appreciated. Then there is the bathroom..the bathroom is extension to the bedroom and is only cordoned off (but not fully) by a curtain. The shower and bathroom are two stalls in the bathroom section It does matter too much if you are with someone you know we'll, however there is still a lack of privacy. Don't stay here if you do not know the person.

Grounds; this is a wonderfully modern hotel with some beautiful design elements. I love the coloured lighting in the restaurant/main foyer. The pool is quite large and a great place to hang out for a few hours.

Location is great as it is situated right y the MRT line, and just behind Clarke Quay. The staff are very friendly and willing to help.

Very welcoming from the housekeeping staff, to the management, to the bellman to the concierge.  Room was very clean as was the entire property. Hotels location is very convenient to the Clarke Quay area and the Clarke Quay train station.  Exercise facilities are average for a four star property.  Pool area looked inviting but I had no time to use it.  I did not use the breakfast facility so I cannot rate it.  I was very disappointed to find on check in that they charge for wi-fi access.  On the hotel website I did not notice that is was an extra item that was charged for.  It was only after looking carefully a second time at the website that I noticed in one area that there was a surcharge for this service.  And it was not a cheap added convenience either.  I did not purchase the w-fi needless to say. There is an internet cafe just across the street and on your way to the Clarke Quay train station if one needs to check their emails.  I think it was 2 Singapore dollars (1.60 USD) for 30 minutes access to start. The rooms had a bit of a strange design to them.  When you opened the shower door the water dripped from it onto the tiled floor in front of the sink, which is sort of free standing.  I tried putting a mat down at the shower door entrance/exit but the shower door seal kept snagging and bunching up the towel so this was of no help. Rooms are not overly spacious due to the way they are designed but were manageable.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to use the pool, restaurant, or gym facilities, so can't comment on those. Of course we planned to use them, but Singapore has so much to offer that we were out and about all day and night. In retrospect, we probably overpaid for a fancy 4-star hotel, as we didn't fully utilize all the facilities during our 3 nights there.

But the hotel was nice and quiet, and the beds were really comfortable for sleeping. As in all spaces in Singapore, the place was a bit tight, but they really did a good layout, so the room did not feel cramped at all.

We arrived on xmas eve, so there was a bit of noise from our neighbors' revelry, but the remainder of our stay was peaceful.

Just across the street to Clarke Quay, but we had to jaywalk across a couple lanes to get there, which I didn't like.

Why top hotels feel they need to charge for all these 'extras' is beyond me; they'd be far better off including them as standard - people expect free wifi these days, and charging another twenty quid for breakfast is a tad cheeky.

Negative:
- the rooms are not sound proof at all... one can hear everything that happens on the corridor. I happened to share my corridor with a (very large) Indonesian family who occupied several rooms adjacent to one another. They apparently thought the hotel was for them only. They slammed the doors (several times per minute... it drove me crazy), they continuously ran from one room to another... and if they didn't run they simply shouted from one room to another. The kids played in the corridor. This went on for several hours in the morning (my ""do not disturb"" sign give me the peace and quiet to sleep in) and in the evening. When I asked them to be a bit more quiet, they looked at me as if they wanted to report me to the staff. I decided not to complain to the reception, and to just suffer it...

Having read a few of the earlier reviews with negative comments about the bathroom, I'm happy to report that 'newer' hotels tend to opt for this 'open' concept - take a look at photos of the room I stayed in.

This part of Singapore tends to have older, established hotels (that need upgrading) so Park Regis is among a few 'new' ones with a modern design - compact would be an apt description. The hotel being only about 2 years old, my room was clean, the bed comfortable, everything worked. Breakfast & lunch buffet are not as extensive as larger hotels, but more an adequate. Their meeting room on the 3rd floor had floor-to-ceiling windows & this made the entire room bright & cheery.

Park Regis Hotel is located in one of the best positions in Singapore: 100mt from People Park Centre (you can shopping and eating anytime) and 100 mt. from Clark Quai, my favourite place in Singapore to spend a couple of hours dining any kind of food and listening to the numerous bands playing live in all pubs. This is a paradise for tourists. Coming back to hotel you find a very gentle and professional staff welcoming you at the entrance and serving you in all you need.

Date of stay: November 2012,Vani10,"Good location, clean hotel, but...","The hotel is new, and well-kept.  It is strategically located. The Clark Quay MRT station is just across the street. The Central Mall is a few meters away. Clark Quay is just across the street. Chinatown is walking distance. Little India is 2 MRT stations away. My husband and I stayed at room 603. Room is small. The toilet of this room smelled sewer. The layout of the room, specially the toilet/shower is no problem for us, since we are husband and wife, but I could imagine it would be awkward for friends to stay in the same room. Bed was okay, not soft and not hard.  Breakfast was so so. Not much choices.  For the price ($28++), I would suggest to have breakfast somewhere else. We had breakfast on the second morning at a nearby McDonald's, and were more contented. Reception staff were courteous and efficient, but somehow lacked warmth. Concierge and the doorman were very warm though, you can feel the welcome from their sincere smiles. A big let down -- no free wifi.  Not even in the lobby area.  You can only have free internet access at the business centre, where there were only 2 computers, so you have to wait for your turn. I brought this issue of no free wifi up with the gentleman in the reception, he said that 4 and 5 stars hotels in Sing do not offer free wifi. The lower classes hotels can offer free wifi because they tuck the cost in in the room rate. Huh? I dont buy that. Anyhow, I would think twice staying in this hotel again.

I mean it's 2012 and I've rarely experienced hotels in Asia which still charge such a high WiFi rate.

My first impression of the hotel was quite bad because when I arrived there was some kind of peak-check-in-time and I had to wait almost 10 minutes. However, the bell staff saved the situation by being very friendly and made sure I can sit in the lounge until it was my turn. In the following days, I was also glad to see that the front desk staff is very friendly and helpful (outside peak hours).

The room layout is a bit odd. Due to the fact that the shower is almost hermetically sealed in a frosted glass cube, there is mold in every corner. Not cool. But at least you can get a really good, high-pressure rain shower.

The pool was really nice and relaxing. Even though the waterfall looks cool, it is too loud. Therefore it's hard to enjoy your burger at the pool restaurant next to the waterfall.

It's in a great location a few minutes walk from Chinatown, Clarks Wharf, the Metro and bus routes and a good central place to stay. The hotel was excellent, staff polite, efficient and welcoming. Concierge Jokob was very informative about nearby Raffles, where he worked for many years. [However, our visit to Raffles Long Room was dissapointing, old charm gone and with 4 Singapore Slings at £60.

The Park Regis has a good 20 metre x 8metre of so swimming pool, nice temperature with a waterfall at one end and loungers set around to laze if you wanted, it also has a small equiped workout gym. The pool scum line could do with a daily clean all around and the scale cleaned off the glass partition but other wise a good swim for working up a healthy appetite for breakfast.
We didn't book breakfast preferring to visit the many food courts in nearby Chinatown, Dimsum was execellant and we looked at the food units that had the longest queues for the best quality food.

What let this hotel down was the room. Obviously designed by someone who didn't intend to stay in one of the Merchant rooms. it overlooked the Manpower Resourses office block at the rear, which you could sit on a window bench seat and look out onto. It had a great shower and toilet but then the rest was totally impractical. The sink unit and small fridge were housed opposite the shower and toilet. A drawer in the unit pulled out almost up against the bed, it contained a kettle, cups, tea coffee sachets but no creamer.

This sink central unit was part of the room that could only be given privacy if you pulled a curtain across . It was plonked in such a position that you had trouble accessing the hanging wardrobe, which contained the safe that when the door was open stopped you opening one of the wardrobe doors. You had to get a clothes hanger to slide down the back of the door, shut the safe door then pull the wardrobe door open quickly.

The double bed was 2 single beds pushed together, the join noticeable leaving no space for a bedside table on one side. The room lacked sufficient draw space and places to put ones suitcases. Designed for the 'look' more that the guests needs and comfort, make sure you check out the hotels video before booking one of the Merchant rooms.

Several fast lifts to all floors and good views on the Merchant Road side and probably better more spacious rooms on that side too

We choose is because everything was booked out in the city and where pleasently surprised. The Merchant Queen Room was light and clean. The bathroom is VERY open but if you know you partner well you wont mind; otherwise you will get to know him or her.
The pool area is gorgeous and when the small water fountains are tinkeling you will hardly know that you are 10 meters from a very busy road.

Rooms are quite compact but cleverly designed with everything you need like mini bar/ tea & coffee facilities/hair dryer/iron & board and plenty of toiletries. You get 2 bottles of water in the room every day which is very handy. My one complaint about the room would be the sound proofing.. you can hear very clearly when there is noise in the corridor outside or in the room next door.
The hotel has a gym which is supervised and has enough equipment for working out. The outdoor pool is a good size with about 10 sunloungers. You get the towels from the pool bar/cafe which opens at 10am .. if you head to the pool earlier than that then you can just grab a towel from the gym next door!
Breakfast had a good variety with asian food/ egg station/ fruit/cheese/bacon etc but i did not like the coffee at all.
Location is great, 2 minutes walk to Clark Quay with all the restaurants by the water and also the Central mall which has got plenty of shops and a starbucks for when you need a caffeine fix :-) Great places in the mall for mani/pedi's too (recommend the Urban nail bar) Clarke Quay MRT station is also connected to the mall and is a very convenient way of getting around Singapore - and also very cheap!

Date of stay: August 2012,gr0f,A quite good deal for Singapore,"Overall, I recommend it, I think it's a quite good deal for Singapore, considering hotels are so pricey there. Here are the pros & cons:

Pros:

- It's not cheap, but compared to hotels in Singapore, I think it is very good value. On a previous trip, I had stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court which is almost next door, a 5-star hotel; but I think the Park Regis feels classier and more modern than the Swissotel, even if it is smaller.

- It's very well located, very close to Clark Quay with all the bars and restaurants, very close to Chinatown as well, and the rest of Singapore downtown is easily accessible in one or a few metro stops, or just walking.

- The rooms are pretty nice, a modern and classy feel.

- For such a small hotel, the swimming pool is quite big. The photos are not cheating you, you can do laps in that pool, and the big waterfall at one end is a nice touch; there are also chairs with their feet in a platform immersed in water, which give you the feeling you are sunbathing in the pool; moreover, the pool is not on the ground floor, so you are not annoyed by traffic noise nor people peeking through the trees; finally, there is a bar next to the pool, so you can enjoy drinks and cocktails; very nice.

- The lobby is small, but with a nice bar and room, behind the reception.

- While we almost did not make a reservation here because of other reviews complaining about the staff, we did not see that at all ! Hotel management must have read the reviews. *All* the staff was very nice with us, from the reception clerk (we had some issues with our rooms not ready because of a too early arrival; they went out of their way to accommodate us, providing a temporary room for a few hours), to the concierge (constantly smiling, offering his help and advice, helping with taxi reservation), the bar staff or the maid. Whatever were their staff issues, they seemed to have fixed them.

Cons:
- The rooms are small, though we were really not that annoyed by it. They are not tiny, just not big. Well, I am a European, maybe a US person would have a different perspective.

- The slightly more annoying thing is what others point out: there is no enclosed bathroom; more exactly, the sink is behind a large mirror which separates it from the room, and naturally the shower and toilets are behind doors each. These doors are made of mint green glass: you cannot see through them, but even these doors do not completely go up to the ceiling (they stop roughly 10/20cm from the ceiling). For the toilets, it can be a bit annoying; some reviews tend to exaggerate the annoyance, IMO, it's nothing terrible, the sound/smell isolation remains pretty good, but maybe it induces a slightly high level of intimacy. I wouldn't share one of these rooms with a co-worker, for instance…

- One slight consequence of the rooms being small is that you may hear corridor noise a little more than in hotels where the beds are further away from the door.

The Merchant Queen room was neat, clean and well appointed but it's not very big. You'll find that having 2 people in the room with luggage a little tight. There's a table and a ridiculously large TV. The bed is large and very comfortable and it has the most amazingly soft pillows. The shower sports an incredibly large shower head that makes you feel like you're having a shower in a monsoon rain - most welcome in Singapore's hot weather. The wifi was expensive and should be free.

The view out the window was of the pool and the waterfall feature - very inviting after a day's outing or after a workout in the gym.

Date of stay: July 2012,Simone_5133,Excellent hotel for first time visit to Singapore,"I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of July. It was my first time in Singapore - first trip east actually and as a single traveller, so had done a fair amount of research before settling on this particular hotel and it couldn't have been a better introduction to Singapore. The hotel is contemporary in design and suited me perfectly. My trip was part business and part tourist, and this hotel enjoys an excellent location adjacent Clarke Quay MRT and less than a 5 minute stroll to the lively bars and restaurants of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, as well as being easily walkable to the likes of Marina Bay, Raffles Place and Chinatown.

The room size was fine for me with some elegant touches, but I would have found it slightly uncomfortable if my partner had been with me as it's rather an unusual layout with the shower and toilet opening straight off the bedroom and there is a sort of dressing area. Spatially, it's just a bit compact and as an architect myself, I'm not sure the layout would suit all - but however for me it was perfect. Lovely view and cushioned window seat overlooking the swimming pool with integral waterfall feature. Overall the hotel was very well designed - a good interior designer involved I would say!

The hotel is quite corporate in ambience, but again this suited me well for this first part of my visit in Singapore. Staff were excellent and professional and I think Wai Hong was one particular person on reception who couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast I found expensive but there are so many places to eat cheaper near by, so I just ate there one morning. Also wifi costs were expensive. But these are minor issues...what a lovely place to catch the sun by the swimming pool, it really was beautifully designed.

Cost was what you would expect for a hotel of this quality, and in line with other hotels - Singapore isnt a cheap city by any means. So to summarise, an excellent hotel in a perfect city centre location which I wholeheartedly recommend. Because I was working outside the city centre, it was suggested I move to somewhere closer by - and it was with reluctance I moved out to Changi Village (see my other review).",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Manchester, United Kingdom",39 ,20 ,,5.0

Located one street back from Clarke Quay and a short walk to Chinatown (or one stop on MRT) the location is great.

The hotel is new, the rooms are modern and a good size. The gym is OK and the hotel has a very nice pool. The front desk staff are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and efficient.

The bathroom is part of the room (glass doors not a separate room) so if you're travelling with a friend or partner there's not much privacy when using the bathroom.

Upon check out our transportation look a long time to arrive, the hotel allowed us to make a free international call to find out the status. The rooms are fairly small with only a glass panel to the toilet area, so you can hear everything that a person is doing in there. There is no wifi available, you need to plug into the wall. That was probably the biggest down side, complimentary wifi for guests should be standard. The breakfast buffet was amazing, great food although very expensive.

The long delay is just due to ""our bank we deal with"".  They could not explain why debit card is not acceptable while it was OK on entire trip.

The MRT is also easily reached, head out of the main lobby and go straight. There is a set of unasumming stairs which will take you to a bridge and over the road to the station entrance.

One day internet for example is over SGD32 and breakfast at approximately the same level. Although the stay was good, I left feeling financially disadvantaged which is a real shame.

All the hotel amenities were also in the room, such as Robes, Slippers, Tea and Coffee, Safe, Iron and Hair Dryer. The room was fresh and still looked new.

The Glass shower and open basin area does not make the room larger, it just highlights the fact that it is really small.
However everything else about the hotel is good. Polite staff, good location near Boat Quay, and reasonable prices. I had asked for an early check in and they did manage to give me a room at 10 am. They have showers that you can use if you arrive before check in time. Unfortunately neither the internet nor breakfast is part of the room tariff, so you will end up spending a fair bit more.

Date of stay: June 2012,louie14,Good hotel for the right deal,"We stay in Singapore often, at least once a month, and have stayed at many different hotels.Recently, we stayed at the Park Regis for 2 nights with our two small children, were upgraded to a Club Deluxe Room without access to the actual Club.  This was part of the Superior Weekend Package (the free Deluxe room upgrade) which also included free internet and buffet breakfast.  The best part about this hotel is the world class service.  From the baby care product package to poolside iced lemon water on arrival....everything about our stay was taken care of from A to Z. The breakfast buffet was out of this world.  Best we've had in town.The room itself was slightly aged but overall very comfortable with high quality materials.  The bathroom was medium sized with tub shower.  The desk had an array of global style plugs for electronics...everything you'd expect at a 5 star hotel.  Our view looked over what appeared to be a construction site (not so pretty, but for free upgrade can't complain) - there was no noise.The pool was GREAT for the kids, totally unexpected by the pictures, but there is a huge box of water toys and cold towels, nice shower room, etc.  The pool attendants were super friendly and helpful - even entertained the kids.Other reviewers have mentioned the ""off-the-beaten path"" location of the hotel.  It was nice to be out of the hustle and bustle, but consider the lengths you must walk to get to any good shopping or restaurants.  A couple times we opted for cabs just to get to orchard road because of our small kids.We had a problem with the check-in - the fact that our rate did not include the actual club was not explained and we ended up getting kicked out from the club during the happy hour service that was pretty embarrassing.  Was happy with the way the management resolved it - sending fruit basket the first night and cheese tray/ wine selection the second.  On the flip side, I made a mistake when booking the hotel and they were very quick to let me cancel the extra night with no fee.  So overall felt that the management at this hotel was responsive and helpful.There are many hotels to choose from in Singapore.  We will return to this one if it pops up on sale again.

The rooms are not huge, more in line with European hotels, but seriously, who comes to Singapore and spends all their time in their room? Sharing with a parter is fine, but be prepared for the bathroom set up. The toilet is open to the room and there is no exhaust fan. I think the hotel could overcome this by completing the door to the ceiling and installing a fan, same with the shower. A dimmer on the lights would be good, if one person is sleeping its hard to not wake them up, or like me, you can shower in the dark. The tv setup is good, gives you weather and local information.

Date of stay: July 2012,Jlengel,Good hotel.,"I stayed for a long weekend at the beginning of July for a quick vacation in Singapore.  Let me break it down this way:The Good:1)  Staff was very helpful and accomodating.  Very good!2)  The hotel is nice and new, design is great!3)  Half of my rating for a hotel is location, location, location.  It's beautifully situated near both quays, Robertson and Clarke, with plenty of shopping and eating close by.  Excellent!4)  Good bed, soft pillows.  I am very picky about pillows.  This hotel had better than average feather pillows.  Although the cases were not great.  And while the bed was good, we had a large bed but it was actually two twins pushed together!  I don't like that.The Bad:1)  Wireless internet.  If a hotel does not have free internet when I'm a paying customer there, it's a huge -1 star for me on tripadvisor.  This is my biggest pet peave about hotels.  If the stupid starbucks down the street that only sells coffee has free internet, why doesn't my hotel which is providing me (supposedly) a lot more.  Frustration!2)  Bathroom.  Unless you are staying here solo, you better be prepared to share your bathroom activities with you room guest.  The shower and toliet ""rooms"" open right up into the bedroom, so whatever is going on in there, is pretty well known throughout the 30sqm studio room.  I guess what I'm saying, not a room for two dudes...3)  A bit noisy.  This is perhaps small, because every hotel is noisy.  But our room was close to the elevator and every morning we heard the kids running up and down the hall with their parents yelling at them (in french usually).  Maybe ask for a room away from the elevator.  Our room was 202.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Hong Kong, China",125 ,67 ,3.0,
Date of stay: June 2012,SunburntViking,Nice Decor - Noisy Hotel,"I stayed at the Park Regis at the end of June 2012 for 3 days for business. The hotel is very nice, clean, modern with attractive decor and it really hasn't aged since it opened a few years ago. The staff were incredibly friendly and in typical Singaporean fashion were willing to help whenever they were allowed. I had a 4th floor standard (park) bedroom facing Chinatown direction. The room is very small, but well laid out, I found myself on countless occasions inhaling and squeezing around the room so i think it would get cramped with more than one person in the room. The room is well equiped with plenty of modern features and hotel conveniences. The BIG issue is that the room walls and its door do not cut out hallway noise, and in a town like Singapore where people are checking in and out around the clock, this can get annoying in the early hours of the morning. The walls were quite thin and I could hear normal conversations being carried out in the rooms beside me and across the hall when their door was open. The other major noise issue I had with my room was that there is a Mosque right (exactly) behind the hotel and they call to prayer every morning at 5:30am for 10-15 minutes. It is very loud and unavoidable. The hotel is in a great location, opposite Clark Quay, quick stroll to China Town and all the tourist sites in the area, although I must say that given that it is a new hotel, most taxi drivers did not know the hotel by name nor its location - take the address with you wherever you go. This also ment that getting a taxi at peak times was hard as there wasn't the normal stream of taxis using the private driveway (the hotel does not have a Merchant Rd entrance). The MRT is just across the road as well, making it very accessible if you prefer the MRT over taxis. The hotel is nice, but my noise complaints from wafer thin walls and doors and the mosque next door has meant that I will be searching for other alternatives next time I'm in Singapore so that I can get a good nights sleep. The breakfast is hideously expensive and not that comprehensive, I recommend heading out if possible. No WIFI was available without charge which dissapointed me enormously and will be a hindrance to business guests.

Other aspects of the hotel including the front staff were lovely and very helpful and the pool area just perfect for adults but may not be quite so suitable for children.  In mentioning children I think this hotel is catering more for business clientele or at  least perhaps solo or couple travellers. Previous reviewers mentioned the small rooms and strange bathroom configuration (seems to impinge on the bedroom) and would have to agree if you are not really good friends with the person you are sharing with it can be a bit uncomfortable. Breakfast was OK and as mentioned above probably fine for those on business but my main issue was with the bed. It  is exceptionally hard so much so its effects on my back affected the last half of our trip dramatically and my husband who doesnt worry about the bed and can sleep anywhere also found it very uncomfortable.Overall the hotel has its very good points and its bad so a 50/50 propostion but purely on the bed comfort and bathroom situation probably would choose another next time.

The pool is great for doing laps and I was told by my co-worker on this trip that the workout facilities were okay even if populated with a couple not so friendly personal trainers waiting for their clients. The only downside was the price of WiFi which was US$30 per day. Outside the hotel is Clark Quay (which is pronounced ""clark key"") has many great places to eat and grab a drink and is directly across the street which you can just mad dash across or take the pedestrian bridge that is just outside the parking lot which also leads to the Clark Quay MRT station.

It is a well-appointed hotel with a pleasant decor, a number of amenties and next to the Clarke Quay MTR station.  The pool is lengthy and good for lap swimming or just relaxing on a deck chair either on the deck or submerged in shallow water.  Having a pool bar is handy as is a separate ""rooftop"" bar off the 4th floor (hotel is 7 stories) so events do not close off the pool area.  Business travelers beware:  There was a 30 dollar a day internet fee which needs to be rolled into the room price.  The gym does not offer 24 hour access, though, the sign on the door says to kindly contact the front desk during non-operating hours.  Staff is programmed to say ""safety and security"" are an issue if asked for early access.  Safety and security did not appear to be an issue when the gym was open and unstaffed for the first hour during my first two days.  A business associate took me to the Swissotel across the way to show me the multi-room, two-story, 24-hour access gym which had far more equipment.  While at the Swissotel, I negotiated a rate which included internet for my next visit in October which was only a few dollars more than the rate and internet at the Park Regis.

Date of stay: January 2012,PJ_SYD,Contemporary hotel with great rooms in good location,"Stayed at the Park Regis for 3 nights and overall was very happy with this hotel. The hotel building is only about a year old so everything still looked and felt brand new with a very contempory design. The ""Merchant Queen"" room I stayed in was quite small but beautifully decorated with a well thought-out design to make use of all available space. Loved the cushioned window seat area of the room overlooking the pool and the back of Clarke Quay - such a relaxing place to lounge and read a book or newspaper. However, the open plan bathroom concept may not suit everyone due to lack of privacy (frosted glass doors on the toilet/shower cubicles and basically stepping out of the shower into the middle of the bedroom) but one would presume being on fairly intimate terms with one's travelling companion anyways! As some other reviewers have noted, the soundproofing on the bedroom doors is woeful and noise from the hallway is very noticeable - but to be honest it didn't stop me from sleeping soundly in the comfy hotel bed or wake me up in the morning. There was also a great pool area with a waterfall feature and loungers set on shallow ledges in the pool. Locationwise, the hotel is within easy walking distance to both Clarke Quay and chinatown area so there are loads of dining (and nightlife) options nearby. It is also just a few minutes walk to the nearest MRT Clarke Quay station so getting around the rest of the Singapore is a breeze. My only major gripe with the hotel is the lack of free wifi in either the public areas or the bedrooms - it seems very petty in this day and age to be charging S$30+ per day extra for this (although they do offer free internet access on 2 workstations in their business centre).",Trip type: Travelled solo,Sydney,378 ,67 ,,4.0

I probably would not mind either having no privacy in the room, as the bathroom and the toilet is an integral part of the room itself, just divided by this glass door and mirror. I would not worry about the noise level and disturbing my partner when ony washing my hands at night perhaps, not to speak of anything else. I would not be so much disturbed by the fact of not having poor access to some hanging space in the 'bath room' section and only 2 smallish drawers for unpacking my suitcase. In fact, being alone in the room, would not worry me that much, as I would not need to share the limited space.
But being with two persons in the room, it would indeed be a worry and I intensly would dislike this smallish space and design.
It would not worry me that much but, that at 7am there was no concierge or porter assistance and only one person at the front desk. It did not worry me even, that the free 'wired-internet' consisted of 2 iMacs, which looked great, whilst often just booked out or blocked and for the use of your own Mac or PC you just pay the price. I mean two fixed complimentary computers for all the hotel guests is quite generous, or do I miss the point here? It did not worry me either that the 1/2 hour WiFi costs some 6 Singapore Dollars and an hour only 10 Dollars plus tax and service fees and the 24h access only 30 $$ plus. The prices in the cafeteria, in particular the prices for small bottles of beer, which size is incidentially never mentioned on the drinks menu, left me unimpressed.

There was a very comfortable queen sized bed and a massive tv that would have felt like you were in a movie theatre because it was so close to the bed.

They offered complementary water and newspaper. There was a business centre where you could use the computers and printers free of charge. There was wifi available within the hotel but this cost $25 which I was to willing to pay!

Date of stay: May 2012,Aki B,Not staying there anymore,"This hotel was great for location. Easy walking distance to almost all the great parts of Singapore like China town, Marina etc. Hotel is clean, the swimming pool is fantastic.

Why I don't wanna stay here anymore is because this hotel lacks the basic hotel requirements. The room is very small, unlike the pics on the net. For the same price I should have gotten Swissotel the Stamford instead (much bigger) 700SGD for 3 nights.

The toilet and shower (no bath tub) are inside the room with glass door (that's a bit open for the WC part). No privacy and my friend and I use the toilet down in the swimming pool area because we don't feel comfortable.

We both had back pain as the bed was either too bouncy or it was about time for the springs to be replaced/fixed.

We heard everyone talking and walking in the corridor no matter how far they're from our room. When people in other rooms open and close their doors, we heard the slamming doors. In the morning we were awaken by this constantly that we have to sleep with ear plugs every night.

The cupboard was designed with no logic at all (forget ergonomics) with the door just against the sink and vanity area so I couldn't put my luggage (or anything) inside. It's very important to hide my luggages as there's no space in that tiny room.

Then there was the super inflexible reception who was like being programmed like a robot. I got there earlier than my friend and would like to check in. My friend forgot to include my name as the guest so she asked if I have a proof of booking (email). After showing the email she still insisted to talk to my friend (who's still on the plane and will arrive soon). I told her my friend will register as soon as he gets to the hotel and in the meantime she can charge my card for the full amount. She was still insisting on phoning my friend and I lost my temper saying he was still on the plane (got a bit annoyed because she thought I was lying perhaps).

the location is good and the common areas are nice, but...

- rooms are tiny. For the same price as a 25sqm room at the Novotel or similar hotels in the area, you get a rat hole with the closet in the bathroom because they had nowhere else to put it...

- my room is at the corner of the building (a long long walk from the elevator...) and the window from the room next door looks right into my room!!! talk about privacy! so you have the choice between letting your neighbours look into your room, or deprive yourself of any sunshine and a pool view that would otherwise be quite nice.

- when I decided to stay in one evening and watch some TV...I had the choice between Chinese channels, sports channels and kids channels (and the usual dozen news channels...) but no good HBO-like channels, or axn, etc...18 channels when every other hotel in town carries between 60 and a hundred...seriously, is it 1985?

- oh and that is the only hotel in town that's asked me for 1,200 dollars in deposit!! that's right, about 30% over my expected bill...

seriously, in some places i would stay ""go ahead, it is not that bad"" but in a town like Singapore, it is very disappointing. You can get either the same for about half the price, or twice as good for the same price!!!",Trip type: Travelled on business,Paris,7 ,6 ,2.0,

Check in was quick and efficient which was perfect after an 8 hour flight.    Room was an interesting configuration which wasn't a problem as a solo business traveller.   The location was perfect with its close proximity to Clark and Boat Quays.  Also, approx 30-40 minute walk to Bugis Street.  Breakfast was OK, small sampling of Asian food with the normal bacon, eggs etc.   Would have enjoyed more Asian dishes.   Only annoyance was a S$30 for 24 hour Internet charge.

Date of stay: April 2012,dontknowdept,"Good location, small room","Location of hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Clark Quay and Chinatown. There is an MRT station just across the road which makes it easy for visitors to move around on MRT.

Hotel room is rather small. It is more for couples or if you are traveling alone. There is no privacy after you stepped out of the shower. It is straight into the room area where the wash basin with a tall mirror separates out the bed.

We also find replenishments of free tea/coffee and toiletries rather inconsistent. It appears as if the hotel is on some cost cutting measures. No doubt, housekeeping readily sends the replenishment to you if you give them a buzz.

Overall staff are pleasant and overall service from the staff is great. However, be mindful that not all can understand English - foreign workers.

Like all hotels they requested for credit cards to swipe as a guarantee of payment when one checked in. However, this is the first time I have come across the practise of the front desk charging the hotel room rates and estimated additional S$100 for each nite's stay just in case one patronises the restaurants or mini bar. They do deduct the amount out though if not utilised during check out. I am not sure why the practise though - not efficient and yet it sends a clear message that the hotel doesnt trust the customer .

Taxi rides to or from airport to hotel is around S$20 to S$25 each way but this is depending on yr pieces of luggage and traffic. We took a taxi back to the hotel from Sands (about 3pm on a Saturday) and was charged an extra S$4 for the short ride as we were told that it is peak hour and thus the extra charge.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",46 ,60 ,4.0,
Date of stay: May 2012,EP99,Quite impressed,"4.5 stars

Very pleasantly surprised.

This hotel is a fantastic option if you are traveling by yourself. As indicated by other reviews, the rooms are that modern style hotel room that is appearing more and more frequently where the living space blends fairly seamlessly into the bathroom without a real partition (the toilet and shower have their own large doors). By yourself this is a non-issue. With others, that's your call.

Details in room are quite nice. A lot of thought went into the complimentary things that you may need to use -- bottles of water, razor, toothbrush. etc. -- and the shower is a nice rain-style shower. Additional smart details include a bench seat near the window, making it feel more like home. Blackout blinds work great, as does the a/c.

Location is fantastic. About a 1.5 block walk to the Clark Quay MRT -- maybe 3 mins -- which is very convenient.

The hotel looks very nice as you pull up, and you are greeted by friendly staff at the door and during check in.

My only complaints are the two mentioned throughout the reviews:

1. The $200 temporary charge when you check in. I get that the hotel wants insurance in case you trash the room. What I don't get is why they can't do what every other hotel does -- take a credit card number down for this very reason without charging unless something happens.

2. Expensive wifi. I know the common answer to this, which is essentially ""thanks for the feedback we will continue to monitor the pricing at our peer hotels."" This is ridiculous, and keeps this hotel from being worthy of a 5 star review. The best hotels don't see what their competitors are charging for everything. They say ""this is the service we want to provide, and we want to distinguish our hotel from the others."" I do appreciate that the hotel offers 20 mins of free internet at a time in the business center, but this is a poor alternative. No legitimate hotel would say ""you can pay 25+ Singapore dollars a day to watch TV in the room, or go watch for free for 20 mins downstairs."" Internet is no different.

It was the 3 of that was going to stay at that hotel, so we planned to get some extra bed. In our mind, normally, room at that rate should have extra bed to be fit in. So that day, we came to this hotel late that evening from a several hours flight. When we checked in, we asked for the extra bed, and the answer is : ""We can't give you some extra bed, cos the room is too small."" and their only solution is for us to upgrade our room to the most expensive room they have + adding some extra bed. It cost us around USD450/night! I asked if we could squeeze one person to the room for some extra cost, the reception simply said, ""no, we can't"". We tried to cancel the room, They said that it will cost us for some cancellation fee. So we keep checking in and hoping that we can use the internet facility in the hotel to find another hotel for my friend to stay, since upgrading the hotel to that rate surely will ruin our budgeting. Then the reception told us, ""Ok..due to security reasons, we would like to remind you that we don't allow 3 people to stay in the room, so if your friend is not going to stay, he should leave at 11 o'clock."" What kind of notification is that? I know that some people do put some ""extra person"" in their room. But it was so rude to warn your guest like that, when our first intention is to ask for some extra bed. I started to get angry but too tired to debate it. After we checked in, we need to find other hotel for my friend and when I asked for the Wifi Password, the receptionist said, ""I'm sorry, but your room doesn't include internet connection, if you want the internet, it will cost you 10 Dollar per hour or 30 dollar for a day"". We were so frustrated!! It's cost cost and cost. It was not easy to find the last minute hotel in that kind of situation. So finally, we are left with no choice but to upgrade the room and add some extra bed (But the breakfast still only for 2 people). But you know what, that room is not even that big. And when I first smelled their pillow, you know the smell of pillow that had just been used by other people? the smell of their heads? yeah.. that's the smell. We complaint, I just can't imagine how could the hotel don't change the pillow cases for their new guests? The breakfast is not really that satisfying too with their mini croissants, mini cinnamon rolls. But the bacon tasted good. So.. overall.. I'm really disappointed with this hotel.

Arriving into the room, it had a view of the swimming pool on the 3rd floor, that was fine, although what was not fine is that the showers and toilets are very opened, and if you are not that close with whoever is staying with you - be prepared to have each other hanging in the lobby when you poop or shower - basically when one is in either shower/toilet, the person outside would hear and see everything despite they used fogged glasses. The toilet in the lobby is probably better than the one you get in the room.

Checking out wasn't smooth either, we had to wait around 5 - 10 minutes before the next agent was available just to drop off our cards and the process took more than a minute even though our rooms were pre-paid.

Despite all the negative stuff, if you are travelling alone, I can probably recommend this hotel to you as the location is quite close to the Clarke Quay MRT station and it is one of the more affordable ones in Singapore (although still not worth it).

Date of stay: February 2012,amroid22,Affordable Chic,"My partner and i checked into this hotel at about 12pm and there was a long queue of people waiting to get rooms. The setup did not seem very controlled, and the lobby is extrememly small with not too many couches for people to make use of. We were told that our room would only be available in 2 hours. The concierge kept our bags and we returned to the hotel as agreed and there was still a long queue of people waiting to get rooms. It was even more chaotic than before. I could say that my first impression of this hotel was not a very good one. Check in staff were not very helpful and very slow. Check in took us over 15 minutes. The room is extremely small and very open plan. I would not recommend this hotel to friends sharing, unless they are very comfortable with each other! We had a room without a view, the rooms that have city or pool views are more expensively priced. Pool was good, just very freezing! Good gym, a bit limited but good equipment none the less. Excellent view of Clarke Quay from the gym - good view to work out to. The location of the hotel is great, Clarke Quay is just opposite the hotel and the MRT station is less than a 5 minute walk away. I would like to especially highlight the great service we recieved from the duty manager, Emily. She was always helpful, considerate and went out of her way to ensure our stay was comfortable, and made it known that we could contact her if there was anything they could do for us.

In Singapore with this price this could be the best I found so far. The staff were courteous (I ignored their little snobbish attitude sometimes). The interior of the room was little different from normal hotel but nice (I guess this is what they meant by boutique hotel). The food was nice in the restaurant. The breakfast buffet had a good spread of choices.
The internet was not free and it was quite expensive. But I could go to the business centre and work for 20 minutes for free. I could also use for more time if there is no other guest waiting. Quite a system and I really cannot complain much.

Although I found some negative statements in here I decided to choose the Park Regis for my stay. And I did not regret my choice. It is true they make you sign a no-smoking clause but they didn´t do it in that rude way as described in here by some people. In fact they provide a cute smoking area outside the hotel that is equipped with tables and chairs. The rooms were all clean and the housekeeping was very friendly. Our cleaning lady was very kind and considerate. The whole staff was very helpful at all times. Even in the middle of the night when we needed an adaptor for our plugs. The rooms could have been a little more soundproof as you could hear doors closing quite often and people walking by your room quite well. But that is just one minor flaw. The rooms were very clean, as was the whole hotel. The rooms are not very spacious but okay for two people if you are of normal size. If you decide on this hotel you should make sure you are travelling with a close friend or relative as the shower and toilet cubes are of milk glas panes and are open to the ceiling. The pool area is cute and clean. They provide comfortable towels there and have a pool bar. The location is just perfect for a tourist as you are close to the MRT station Clarke Quay (just across the street) that gets you to the intersections Outram Park or Dhoby Ghaut in only two stops. Clarke Quay (bars and clubs) can easily be reached by foot.
There is a mall just across the street that provides a huge food court and a money changer. Internet was free of charge for the first 20 minutes in the hotels business center. There is also a small internet cafe just around the corner that is open 24hrs. (on the way to the mall, just behind the MRT station)
The staff at the hotel was really great. They remembered our faces and habits which was nice because they remebered how we liked our coffee, what time we would get up and they could clean the rooms, and so on.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Aschaffenburg, Germany",11 ,8 ,5.0,

The rooms seemed larger than normal due to an unusual bathroom design and there is a lovely window seat. The view from the room was not that great but the room was on the back of the hotel so there was no traffic noise.

Date of stay: January 2012,babyblues33,Great location,"I stayed here for one night before moving to another hotel (they were all booked up for this night) and was very happy with the location - across the street from Clarke Quay. Check in was relativelly smooth, and everyone at the front lobby area during my check-in was very nice. I received a handicap room, which frustrates me because everything is usually too low for me (I'm tall), but I think I lucked out on this one - the room was quite big, including the bathroom. However, there was no actual shower in the bathroom - it was the bathroom itself which was very interesting. I know this is normal in many countries so it was definitely an experience. The sitting bunk at the window was a nice surprise, but the view wasn't worth the time to sit there - my room looked right into another building where I constantly saw people through the windows. My bathroom also had a rather large window, which also looked out at the building across the back alley, so it was a little frustrating to have the curtains closed the entire time I was in the room.

Had the buffet breakfast in the morning and it was pretty good - decent selection. Also used the business centre to check my email - they have two nice MACs to use and you have 20 minutes at a time to use one (unless no one is waiting). The ladies working the desk at the business centre were very friendly.

The rooms are compact & there are no proper bathrooms (at least in the standard double rooms), just a sink area, and separate shower and loo cubicles. If you like to have your ablutions in private, this is a definite disadvantage.

Wi-fi was rather expensive, so we didn't use it. The staff were helpful & polite.

Be aware that the hotel is right next to a mosque, so if you are given a room facing that side, ask to be moved, unless you wish to be woken up at 5am. Also, because it is relatively new, some taxi drivers may not know it, and are likely to take you to the St. Regis instead.

Date of stay: December 2011,BerniceManila,One of the best beds I have ever slept on!,"My husband and I stayed in this modern hotel for  3 days and 4 nights (December 24-26).  What we loved most about the place was the really nifty interiors and how the space was fully utilized.  Most of all, the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept on (at par with the bed provided by The Palms, Boracay).  Another plus to this hotel is its location.  It's a 5-minute walk to Chinatown and Clark Quay.  Getting around Singapore is really easy from the hotel since the tube is roughly a 2-minute walk.  I guess the only downside would be the sudden deposit that you need to give the hotel upon check-in. We were caught off-guard when we were told to deposit $300 SG.  I would advice bringing extra cash (around $500 would be good to cover the deposit, depending on the room) or keeping your card clear for this.  Don't worry though since the amount will be returned upon check-out.  I would definitely recommend this this hotel to those taking it easy in Singapore.

We spent New Years eve in Singapore and at the end of the celebrations we walked from the singapore flyer/marina bay to the hotel. That is a longish walk but it is nice and possible to walk from the marina bay if you like doing so. The staff were very welcoming and there were always taxis ready to jump onto from the taxi rank outside when we wanted. Rooms are small but functional, clean and quiet. We asked for a nice view as it was our first time in Singapore and we got a nice one on the 7th floor. The pool is nice however not many loungers so the only time we wanted to relax by the pool we had to sit at the bar's chairs. We were not bothered as we were not there for lounging at the pool but could be an issue if that's what you like to do while in Singapore...

Date of stay: November 2011,1IslandGuy,Modern Singapore Hotel- RECOMMENDED!,"I stayed at the Park Regis Singapore last month for four nights. The hotel is beautiful and very modern, with a warm helpful staff to add to it.

Upon arrival at the hotel, it was pleasant to be greeted by waiting bell staff, and escorted into a beautiful modern lobby. I was quickly checked in, and although my room was not quite ready, I was able to catch up on email and use the gym and pool in the meantime. WIFI in the hotel is only available in the lobby, which was disappointing, and you have to pay for this, but there is wired internet in the guest rooms.

Guest rooms are spacious enough for one or two people, and have large views of the pool (other rooms have city views), which is nice. THe rooms have separate areas for walk in shower, and toilet, and the sink/basin area is open to the rest of the room. It is a great set up!!

I had a couple drinks in the lobby and breakfast there as well, which was nice. The gym is a good size and overlooks the city and pool area. There is also a nice lounge area by the pool if you have the time to sit around....there is so much to see, do and eat in this great city.

Location wise too, it was great. I do a lot of running, and the hotel was a block to Clarke Quay and the picturesque riverside for running and seeing many of the sights. The metro- or MRT as the locals call it, is a block away as well, so getting anywhere is very easy. Cabs are also plentiful and inexpensive.

This was my first trip to Singapore, but I will be back, and recommend this hotel, if you want to be by the river, and within easy walking distance to Chinatown. GREAT HOTEL!!! Seriously!!",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Vancouver, BC",60 ,42 ,,5.0

""Singapore Park Regis""

I did a lot of searching via various search engines and was amazed at how expensive Hotels are in SIN, some of them with very little to offer, pretty poor in location and amenities.
The Park Regis is 5 min from Clarks Key Metro Station, there is a good Breakfast Buffet in the morning, cosy Bar, Pool and Gym, Internet is for free in the Business Centre but wireless has to be paid for.

As most flights to Europe are late in the evening I arranged a late check out with the hotel which did cost me GBP50 but well worth it in my opinion as I hate hanging around all day just waiting for my flight home.

Date of stay: December 2011,Singapore_trav,Relatively inexpensive but...,"Stayed two nights at this hotel. The rooms are small and though modern, I'm not sure it's designed for families, especially with the open concept bathroom which turned into a play area for my daughter. But value wise, it's hard to beat at just under S$200 per night. Other hotels of similar standard would be S$300 plus, though the rooms might be larger. What I didn't like was the hotel asking me to sign out for an umbrella which I requested to borrow. The form i signed even spelt out penalties for not returning the umbrella. This is the first time I've been asked to sign for an umbrella as other places have willingly lent one without requiring a guarantee it'll be returned. Come on, show your guest some trust, I say. It just felt like a place that's too calculative and petty, like i'd want to keep their umbrella! Also,  housekeeping could be improved. The room was dusty on some surfaces and the batteries for the TV's remote nearly flat. These things need to be checked daily by the housekeeping staff. That said, the room service food was good and service generally polite.

I didnt quite like shower handle designed as it sprays water out of the shower room.  Our room faced the view of the pool with the waterfall. It would be great to ask for the 2nd or 3rd floor as I am sure the sound of the waterfall would have been most relaxing. On our 5th floor, the sound was quite faint.

Date of stay: September 2011,Mini_Cheryl,Smelly Pillows with Slow Housekeeping Service But Room is Okay,"I checked-in to Park Room No. 301 for two nights. The first impression was acceptable for a business traveler, not until the time to turn in. I found all the 4 soft pillows had dirty smell as if they had not been changed from the previous guest who checked-out from that room. I requested housekeeping to change them but waited for about 20 minutes. I had to call the second time to repeat my request. Then, housekeeping staff brought 2 hard and 2 soft pillows (instead of all 4 soft pillows) to my room. Yet, two of the pillows still have the dirty smell not from the pillow case but from the pillows within. As it was already late at night, I just made do with the remaining two and requested for another round of change on the next day. That was a major setback that I have ever experienced with a 4-star hotel.
The buffet breakfast spread was okay though the food taste was not impressive at all.
However, the 25-m swimming pool was great for a weary soul after a strenuous day at work. There was no kid's pool.
My advice is to avoid Room No. 301 as it located just next to the lift. You therefore will hear the lift arriving that kept repeating the recorded message: ""Third Floor"" throughout the night.
Location wise, it was quite central and the Clarke Quay MRT station was just diagonally opposite the hotel. The entertainment area of pubs, restaurant and night life was just across the street, which was very convenient. However, there was a mosque nearby and one would probably be awakened by the prayer sound at selected hours.
A thumb up to the front desk lady as she was very accommodative with my late check-out request at 2p.m. The front desk and restaurant staffs were very courteous and helpful.

Date of stay: September 2011,KeithFitz,Decent location.  Bad service.,"This new hotel near Clarke Quay in Singapore is in a good location; close to the business district, but also near the river and good night spots.The hotel is brand new.  The rooms are small, but modern and stylish (though a bit cheap).  There are a few things about the rooms that I found a bit annoying.  For example, the shower door opens out into the rest of the bathroom, flush along the floor -- making use of a bath mat impossible (pushed away when the door is opened), so you're going to get a wet floor.  And (I don't know how many of you are bothered by this),  the soap dish in the shower is a flat piece of metal (with no grooves or holes), so the soap sticks to it and you need a screw-driver to pry it off the dish to use it.  It's not a huge flaw, but these two things suggest that whoever designed the rooms did not actually try using them or put much thought into the experience for guests.  That lack of effort bothers me.The small pool and gym are satisfactory, and the lobby and lounge are alright.My big problem with this hotel is the lack of service culture and the attitude of the front desk staff.  I arrived directly from the airport after an international flight.  Upon check-in, the receptionist had a problem with the credit card machine.  For a 5-night stay at just under S$300 per night, they required blocking S$2600 on my credit card (apparently they were worried that I was going to steal the furniture -- though I'm not sure the furniture would even be worth that much).  After a few tries (there was a problem with their connection, not with my card), she instructed me to wait.  I was kept at the front desk for nearly 25 minutes (they wouldn't give me the room key until they had my credit card blocked), rather than the staff just asking me to come back later to try -- even though I asked to go to my room and suggested we try later.Upon sign-in, they also inform guests that there is a S$300 penalty for smoking in the room.  And they made me initial that clause on the form, separate from my signature at the bottom (despite the fact that I requested a non-smoking room, anyway).  I have not experienced this one at any other hotel.I stay in business hotels more than 100 nights per year -- many of those in Singapore.  Some hotels know how to make their guests feel welcome.  Others are obviously much more concerned about making sure they get your money and making sure that you can't cheat them.  This hotel does not make me feel welcome.  It makes me feel like they are doing me a favor by letting me stay there, while they make sure they get their money.It's put me off...I shall not be staying here again...There are far too many alternatives in Singapore, and there are some hotels that really understand customer service (this is not one of them).",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Singapore, Singapore",22 ,39 ,2.0,

Breakfast was buffet style and served in a very spacious and light room at the ground level. Lots of choice of Westerna and Asian foods.
This is a well located and for Singapore reasonabley priced 4 star hotel. It's fairly new. from the hotel it's a short walk to Clarke and Robertson Quays where the nightlife and restaurants are, though I'd suggest the hawker stands for the bargain food, head towards Chinatown and you'll spot them.
OK - the bathrooms! Due to the small space in the grandly named ""suites"" (about 20sq mts) the toilet and shower have been designed to fit along one of the walls with a vanity/sink opposite which sort of acts like a room divider...despite the opague glass there is very little privacy afforded. Likewise the shower which has 2 shower heads ( a nice touch) is cramped and I managed to flood the whole area by knocking on of the shower heads, so be careful when turning around.

This hotel has a boutique look , with trendy interiors. Rooms are a bit cramped ,if you are on double accomodation .Very weird arrangement of bathrooms which is seperated from beds by a mirror partition. No complaints from me, as I was on single accomodation. Room had a good view overlooking ,infinity pool ,facing the Clark quay.

Better to opt for breakfast option ,which may cost 20SGP,else its around 32SGP.Breakfast buffet was very simple & basic ,would not highly recco ,if you had other options. Being a veggie ,the options were even more cut down.

I was totally let down by the gym ,which had just 1 threadmill (with time limit of 20mins) & few other basic amenties.Gym opens at 6am & can be quite a crowd in the morning. The gym instructor was very helpful though.

With rate of 200SGD ,expectations were slightly higher in terms of room dimensions,facilities like gym & breakfast buffet options.

5. i requested for complimentary parking tix so during check in, the lady asked for the car number BUT we realised that a parking tix is required upon exit (they do not read your car number) so we have to take the effort to take 1

Date of stay: April 2011,kewpielovesyou,"convenient location, new hotel, small-ish rooms though","firstly, i think it’s a pretty new hotel. So the taxi driver took a couple of seconds longer to register the hotel in his mind. Arriving was ok. The reception was conveniently located... the receptionist knew to expect me cos it was a super late flight into Singapore... and check in was brisk. Was expecting more of a run down of where’s where...in terms of “breakfast is on level blah... business facilities are.... and the pool and gym are....” – that wouldn’t have hurt.

The room itself is small. But adequate. The funky open plan bathroom is nice... no complaints about that. comfort (bed) is also good... the aircon however, is abit odd. It’s an old fashioned lever system... had to control the specific temperature...very minute adjustments for every degree. But i am just being picky here. It does blow right onto the wall where the bed is... and kinda onto the people sleeping... got really dry. Had to boil water several times to humidify the room

Staff knowledge about the local area... abit 50/50... one guy didn’t know where a certain road was (just round the corner).... but again, minor detail.

But for the price and proximity to Clarke quay and Chinatown and the MRT, it’s very competitive alternative to my usual stays in orchard road itself.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,kewpielovesyou,99 ,42 ,3.0,

1. You can't beat the location - right in the middle of Clark Quay near it all (also the MRT stop is close)
2. Rooms are very clean, well appointed, modern & sleek
3. The bathroom has ZERO privacey. This is only good for someone traveling solo or if you are extremely close (maybe a little too close) with your friend or spouse. The toilet and shower are sectioned off but there is no door to the bathroom area. I wish I had taken a photo.
4. We stayed for the weekend and it was fine but the room was so tiny that towards the end we were getting on one anothers nerves. Two people in the room cannot move around at all. I cannot stress how small the rooms are. But, if you are only going to sleep there than this might be the right place for you.
5. Hotel staff were fine. Nothing above and beyond.
6. Internet costs $30/day or $10/hour.

For the price there are definitely better hotels with more space but this hotel does offer a great perk which is its location. I probably would not stay here again if I were traveling with another perosn.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",13 ,6 ,3.0,

There are 4 room categories. The 1st 3 are of the same size and dimension, just different views. Park Room - facing the Ministry of Manpower. Merchant Room - facing Merchant Rd. If you are on a higher floor, you could see the river. Quay Room - have direct access to the pool from your balcony.
Facilities:
As in previous comments, the toilet and bathroom layout are open concept, fine for couples or people who are close to each other; there is really no privacy.
That said, everything in my room was clean, fresh and looking very new.
Huge plasma TV, limited channels, only Aust Network, CNA, CNN, Cartoon Network, Nat Geo, CNBC Singapore, CCTV, NHK, plus the local channels. No movie channels, although, they have movies no demand. Each movie costs S$18++, unlimited viewing for 24 hours.
Swimming pool is 25m, 1.2m deep, with a waterfall at one end. Sundeck chair right out in the water. Love the idea and layout. Pool is clean and water cold and refreshing.
Food & Beverage:
This is the part where I feel, a lot of work needs to be done. The biggest snag is probably the wait staff who are inexperienced in using English as a means of communication. Or inexperienced kitchen hand. E.g. unable to cook a good soft boiled egg without a timer, bad timing in serving food (long delay between one food and another), no lime in mojito, things like that. Everyone has a making mistakes phase, but, just so you know, they are still in that phase.
Staff are generally warm and friendly - compliments to them.

Date of stay: March 2011,John C,Will be a very good hotel,"We stayed there this month. My wife and I for 2 nights and my adult son and my daughter and husband for 1 night - 3 rooms. The hotel is in a great loction. 1 minute from Clarke Quay and walking distance to most other places. I am aware the hotel only opened in December and as such will have some initial problems that I am sure they are addressing. We arrived about 1pm to be told our rooms were not ready which was fine by us as we knew it was a 2pm checkin. We did our checkin procedures at that point and the lovely young lady advised us that we would be receiving a complimentary upgrade but we would have to wait. That was all fine. We all found a little disturbing that each room required a $200 bond, something I have never encountered in all my world travels. Anyway we all agreed to that. We then went over to Clarke Quay whilst we awaited our rooms. We returned about 2.30pm - 3pm to be told that the hotel was running at 100% capacity (good for them) and that our rooms would be some time yet. I complained to the same young lady that it was not right to have to wait another hour or two for a room. She spoke to her supervisor who came and spoke to us. This lady was also lovely and apologised for the delay and offered the 5 of us a complimentary buffet breakfast for the following morning along with a complimentary drink at the bar whilst we waited. We all thought this was a good gesture and well handled by staff. We finally got into our room about 5pm. The rooms were lovely although I am sure none of us received an upgrade as initially advised. They were a standard room, new and very well appointed with very comfortable beds, great plasma and anything else you could wish for. In one of our rooms the builders had forgotten to seal between the shower and bathroom which did causing a very wet floor in the toilet but that was a minor thing. The breakfast although complimentary was a disaster. Apart from the egg station,breads etc. the buffet was mostly cold. Bacon was cold, sausages were cold as well as a number of other offerings. It amazes me that they didn't light the flames under the serveries to keep offerings at least warm. The staff at this hotel are great and very friendly and helpful. It is obvious through this forum that the manager is ""on the ball"" as far as complaints are concerned and is addressing those issues.

Date of stay: February 2011,billybrown,"Best bed, worst Hotel","Where do I start.....the good stuff, great location only a short walk to China Town and across the road from Clarke Quay, gets a very big tick. The bed, for some reason the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on In 6 countries in Asia.

The not so good.......first room had an overwhelming feeling of claustrophobia, room is definately smaller than anything I have encountered anywhere, ever and there was no way I was staying here. To the Hotels credit when I told the Duty Manager (at 11pm at night) that we couldnt honour the booking and stay in the room, he bent over backwards to understand our concerns and assist with another room. We received a higher grade room that was slightly larger and had less of a feeling of being locked in a shoebox as it was ona building corner with lots of windows to the outside. It was still very small by average hotel standards and even though it was an upgrade I doubt it would even make 30 m2. The design is just plain strange, there is nothing chic or trendy about a toilet and shower in the middle of the room constructed out of frosted glass.

Whilst our confirmation of booking showed free internet access in room, the Hotel literature said it was a purchased package. We never connected to it because of this and no staff member told us any different when asked.

The awful.........it was dirty, unkempt and things didnt work. This combined with constantly having to push past a cleaners trolley in the hall, poor breakfasts and disinterested staff became the real reasons for a poor review

To justify my comments

1) The hallways and surrounds of doors constantly were dusty on the timber area's, clearly no one was cleaning these area's
2) The ""bathroom"" had dirt and marks left from construction, it was plainly obvious the glass had never been cleaned and tiles polished of excess grout since occupation
3) The toilet pan and cistern were not secured to the wall or floor and rocked from side to side when you sat on it. If felt this was unsafe and used a public toilet up the road.
4) The fit and finish of walls showed excess fillers and area's of sanding/repair that had never been finished, the wardrobe door rubbed against the ceiling impeding its operation.
5) Light switches were positioned in strange places, for example, to turn the reading lamp off on the right of the bed, you used the switch on the right hand side. To turn on the toilet or shower lights you turned on the switch next to the front door

All this was reported to Hotel staff during occupation with no response, on our final day I refused to pay the bill and ended speaking to a Senior Manager who I think genuinely accepted my comment and criticism, provided me with a discount and complimentary transfer to the Airport.

The end result of the Managers efforts were positive, but even if everything else worked or was of an acceptable standard, its room size and weird design would preclude me from visiting again.

Normally I stay in Swisshotel Merchant court, right across the street, but there was no availability here or in my other preferred hotels. I read the reviews here before I booked and knew what to expect.

Check in: I did my check in after midnight, it was quiet and check was friendly and fast. When I asked about participation in any frequent flyer program they said they were working on it and I could give them my singapore airlines KrisFlyer nr, which they would work towards crediting when their connection would be up and running... Will see.

The room:
It was room 509, seemed like a standard room as described by many others on this forum. Not to big, but very complete. The shower was great!
What I also liked very much is, that the Aircon and TV are switched off, no waste of energy.. The only fault here is, there is no guide on how the A/C works,,,so it took me some time to figure out.

Service:
This is where you notice it is a new hotel. At breakfast I gave my roomnumber and sat down. In most hotels you get asked for coffee/tea, here you have to ask everytime you have breakfast. In most hotels you will be given the breakfast receipt to sign, here you always had to ask for it.
When I checked out, I got the invoice to check and there was a breakfast missing. I told them and regretted shirtly after that I was so honest, because it took them 5min to add another breakfast to my bill. Also when I signed for the final bill, I was waiting for the receipt, but it didnt came, I had to ask for it, for which the receptionist needed my credit card again to pull up the bill...

All in all, a recomendable hotel,, just bear with being part of the staffs training program. I didnt mind to much, because it was compensated by the relative low cost of the accommodatin in its start up phase.

New hotel opened in Nov 2010 and just a couple of very minor glitches, (ie no bath mat left day 2 and we chose our 2 rooms to be on different floors so we could check in straight away at 3pm).
Positive side: extremely attentive staff at reception!!! well appointed room whilst small by Australian standards, it was good size for asia. open vanity area not unlike the new Crown Metropole in Melbourne expect no ability to screen this on off as you can there, but this was no issue for us. Very good breakfast selection and we ate at the hotel as it was included whereas we wouldn't usually. Lovely pool and bar area with a water fall and the rooms opening to the pool looks nice.
The staff went out of their way to open up the business centre at 11pm so I could do our flight check in and once I email the board passes to reception they printed them without charge due for me which was a great service late at night.
The foyer and bar area is exceptionally good with plenty of semi secluded areas to sit..

No reason was given and when we asked how long we had to wait, they could not give an answer. Many other people were also waiting for their rooms and the lobby was getting crowded. I noticed that drinks were not served.

After waiting for an hour, we were told that our room was ready and were brought up to our room. Upon opening the door, the staff had a look of embarrassment, and told us that the room was not ready. We did not know what was wrong with the room as we had not even stepped in. We were escorted back to the lobby to wait again. This time, the staff took his initiative and told us we can order complimentary drinks from the hotel restaurant.

The staff from the restaurant refused to provided us with a menu even though I requested for one. He just informed us that they are a full bar. I asked what they serve and his reply was juices and soft drinks. I had to ask what juices and what soft drinks before he is will to recite a list. He had to be prompted and not offer information like any good service staff should. And I don't understand why he could not just pass us the menu because right after we took our order, he gave the menu to another guest at another table. SO they have a menu after all. Amazing.

After some time we were told our room was really and finally we get to enjoy the room. I think they upgraded us as our room has pool access. I like the compact and well designed room. It was clean and new. However, when I dialled for room service, they did not appear.

Maybe it was New Year's Eve, maybe because they were running full house and maybe because they are new. No matter what it is, it reflected badly on the Regis brand. I would think being a Regis, they would have expected and know how to handle these situations. Despite all, I am still willing to give them time to fix these glitches and might check into this hotel again.

The room is contemporary furnished. The open concept bathroom was nice, adds more space to the entire room. Beds are just right, not too hard, not too soft. Awesome goosedown pillows! Upto six in a room, thats a looooot!. Toiletries are from the White Company in London. Pool is gorgeous! You can actually have 3 people inside comfortably with the bay window's day bed. Location is tops in Clark Quay.

Only gripe is, taxi is a bit a work to call since its entrance is from the sidestreet, not totally in Merchant road entrance/exit. Not many taxi knows it yet, but eventually.
I say go for it if you got a good price! its well worth the money and effort.",Trip type: Travelled with family,Singapore,17 ,26 ,,5.0
Date of stay: December 2010,stevani,clean but small and weird design,"Booked 3 nights Park Queen room from Agoda - prepaid payment usd 530 exclude breakfast.  Check-in was quite fast.  We were given room at 3rd floor exactly  in front of housekeeping room, so everytime we open our room door the view is clean/dirty towels, soap, etc  also we found housekeeping trollies and dirty towel baskets  ""parked"" in front of our room....we didnt expect this ""view"" for paying over usd 500Room is clean - of course it's a new hotel - but small and design is weird.  The bathroom is only frosted glass panels, unpleasant if you share the room even with your spouse.  TV chanel selection is very limited,  film is available with additional cost. Location is OK, clarke quay mrt is across the street and china town is only 7 minutes walking.  Didnt try the pool, gym and food so cannot comment.   Concierge is quite helpful, but found other staff are too ""cool"" not too friendly including housekeeping. Receptionist swiped my card (about $ 580) when check-in for deposit; I think the amount is too big consider I had paid my room in advance.  When check out I ask the receptionist to tear the deposit receipt since no minibar, laundry etc used; she refused to tear the receipt she said the amount will be returned back to my credit card a week after check out....weird.....i've travelled around I am familiar about deposit but this first time I experience receptionist refuse to tear the deposit receipt when no additional service/minibar used.  If they want to make sure I didnt steal anything from the room they can just check the room while process my check out",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,jakarta,84 ,4 ,,1.0
Date of stay: December 2010,tesyasblog,Too bad the wifi is not free,"When I visited this place, the hotel was still very new, so everything was so clean. Even some of the provided equipments inside the room have never been used I guess.

The rooms was really nice, not too big and also not too small. Just perfect for couple travellers. But when you are travelling with kids, the open concept bathroom will be a disaster. Guess the kids will make the whole room wet.

I booked the hotel through agoda, and had no problem at all when I check in. The lady asked to pay deposit for my two nights stay which I can use my credit card. The check in and check out process was really fast and efficient.

The hotel located between clarke quay and chinatown MRT. I seldom use the MRT, as so many busses pass the clarke quay station bus stop. The location of the hotel was perfect. Just across the hotel you can find a shopping mall called Central having so many resto.

The negative part beside the bathroom is also the wifi. Even a budget hostel provide a free wifi, but in this hotel we have to pay. I think the hotel management should provide a free wifi if they are really serious to make this hotel a travel and leisure hotel.

Date of stay: December 2010,Danny Chan,A hidden gem right in the City Center,"Stayed at the Park Regis Singapore 3 times within the last one month.  We found this hotel chic, cozy and comfortable.The rooms are compact with the bathroom and toilet hidden behind a cleverly layout mirror.  A good selection of toiletories amenities are provided.  Even though the hotel is very new, but the shower and toilet would need a bit of maintenance already.  The view from the rooms we'd had was beautiful, and we loved the pool with the lovely water feature.   We never had breakfast in the hotel, but the spread we'd seen wasn't great enough to keep us,  as It is just mins away from China Town so we were never far from food. Service is friendly and efficient, but we would expect some recognition after 3 stays in the hotel.  We loved the blinking light effects the hotel does with its outside lights at night.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",18 ,28 ,4.0,
Date of stay: December 2010,Rellik666,Fastastic Service & Facilities let down by cold breakfast...,"Stayed at the park regis for 2 nights and had a great time. The taxi driver wasn't sure where it was so take the address with you as it is so new. The rooms are small but fine for a solo traveller or cosy couple. Wireless Internet is available, but they didn't tell me this until the day I left....but I didn't ask till then either. There isn't any hotel information booklet, and the information on the TV is limited although up to date with flight arrivals and incidental costs. I got a good deal as an opening special so I felt the hotel was very good value for money, not sure how much it would be at rack rate. Swimming pool is great and nice for a lazy afternoon. Location is good, but can be a bit of walk if you don't want to the use the train. But the MRT is right outside. It is very modern and new and the staff are genuine and helpful. Breakfast was varied and had a good selection of western and asian food. But the cooked food was all cold on my second day, the food isn't turned in the urns or the heaters are not powerful enough.....generally though it was great and I would recommend especially for solo travellers.",Trip type: Travelled solo,Melbourne,15 ,13 ,5.0,
Date of stay: December 2010,Diving-Addiction00,Great Location...Brand new Hotel right by the Central Business District and Food Haven,"I was struggling to find a decent hotel in Singapore in December as I had an urgent business trip to make and ran into a good rate (SGD$200 per night) at this hotel that only had 1 review (the first review of this page) in a excellent part of the city, right opposite an MRT station which makes life so convenient.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. This is a 5 star hotel that is brand, spanking new (opened 5 days prior to my arrival) that is in a quiet but convenient location right by the Singapore river, tons and tons of food outlets, restaurants, bars and the Clark Quay MRT (underground train) station.

Breakfast: wasn't told if I had buffet breakfast upon check in so assumed I didn't have any as part of the room

Service: Very pleasant. Staff went out of their way and were warm and friendly as you would expect. This is sadly lacking in many hotels today in Singapore where its too business like and cold.

Cleanliness: Brand new hotel, brand new rooms and very nice and comfy rooms. No dust, airconditioning was cold (which is excellent) and the hotel was quiet which made for excellent sleep as I was down with a bout of flu.

Rooms: A little small for the average european traveller but perfect if you are flying solo or down for short trips into Singapore. It isn't catered I think for family's so much but more so for business circles. Shower and toilet are a modern concept and both open up and face the bed. Some people may need a little bit of adjusting to this but I was fine with it.. Small for the average traveller but I was prepared to put aside that for the comforts of the room because it's one of those hotel rooms you look forward to going back to after a long day of meetings.

If you are looking for a quality hotel at a reasonable price and are prepared to pay a little extra for location, convenience and comfort, I would highly recommend this hotel.

It has a good future. And I would, if the room rates were about the same in the future, make this a regular hotel.

One downside is the internet rates; very steep and catered for the businessman or corporate traveller who is going to put the bill on company expense. SGD$150 for 5 or 7 days. SDG$6 for 10 minutes. SGD$60 for 24 hours. That is, in my opinion, absurd rates to be charging in this day and age when WIFI/FREE INTERNET should be made available to guests.",Trip type: Travelled on business,Malaysia,392 ,275 ,5.0,

Date of stay: November 2010,MarieK2.,Hard to see value in this new hotel,"We stayed at the Park Regis a few days after opening. OK, so it takes a while for new hotels to iron out the kinks but there are certainly a lot of kinks.

Rates are currently low no doubt to build up clientelle and we paid much less than other hotels within such close proximity to Clarke Quay. The location for this is superb, less than 3 minutes walk from Clarke Quay MRT and right behind fabulous Brewerks. That's the end of the good news.

Check in was fine until the receptionist swiped my credit card fro $100 without permission. We paid extra for a room with a view, the view was of the rear of Brewerks with a glimpse of the river between buildings. The rooms are minute - we saw several. They only have a double bed and no walking space around it. There is a nice window seat, but if you sit there the person in the next room can see you.

The bathrooms are of the uber-trendy style - meaning in the room, with no walls or doors between. Just frosted glass panels. We've been married 20 years but find the lack of toilet privacy a little unpleasant. One person can't use the loo in the middle of the night without disturbing the other. The room wasn't clean either, we had to call housekeeping to empty bins. The cleaning staff were still vacuuming the halls at 9pm at night so it really should have been sparkling but wasn't.

Finally, on check out, we had to argue to get the $100 back.

This hotel might get better, but unless you get a great deal, there are far better run places with bigger rooms nearby.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",41 ,51 ,3.0,
