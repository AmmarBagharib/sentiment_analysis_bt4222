Date of stay: August 2023,Love_Life_Sydney,Clean and comfortable,"Hotel rooms in Singapore are so expensive so to find a decent hotel, with easy transport access and food locations, at less than S$200 was a good deal. The compact room meets your basic needs, no fancy mood lightning or lovely artworks to grace the wall. It has clean sheets and towels, a small bathroom and pump pack amenities. There is a kettle, glass bottle for refills, small selection of tea and coffees, a small fridge and a room safe. Closet space is quite limited but it has an ironing board which I used as a luggage rack. No bathrobes but there were 2 pairs of complimentary slippers.  It has usb ports and sufficient electrical points.   The location is the best. Bugis St, Bencoolen and Rochor  St MRTs are within walking distance.

Clean comfortable rooms. Nothing flash, but you know what you are getting when you book Ibis. Lots of eating and shopping options nearby. Transport links are excellent.  Staff are friendly. Our only disappointment this stay was the lack of help with a jammed lock on our suitcase. I asked on checkin if someone could wrench it off. Initially they said they would have to wait for engineering personnel the next morning to help us. I said we needed to get into our suitcase that evening and if they had a screwdriver or something we could just wrench it and break it off. No big deal!

Date of stay: June 2023,Keith L,Friendly and Customer Focused Hotel,"Though the car park is rather small, I doubt non Ibis customers will park their cars due to the high carpark fees. If you are a guest staying in the hotel, don't worry as the carpark fees are waived.

Check-in was without any hassle and both my boys and I were in the room in no time. The room was clean and tidy. We had our lunch in Taste restaurant and ordered Fish & Chips, Nasi Lemak and the Ravioli. All were delicious and both my boys love the food. As I am an Accor member, i redeemed my welcome drinks.

This hotel is well located in the Singapore city. It is walking distance to many shopping malls(Bugis Junction, Bugis+, Guan Yin Temple, Sim Lim Square etc). There are also at least 2 metro stations within 10 mins walk from the hotel.

It was amazing, it changed each morning but had the staples for people who need fruit salad, toast and english breakfast.  We dined at the restaurant and it was lovely.

Just a little less comfortable is about the seats organization, a bit dark, low ceiling, those give less enjoyment of my breakfast.
Tips: I always take seat closer to the outer glass wall for brighter and higher ceiling.

As some of reviewers had written about door insulation, I do hope the management will improve it by doing something on the door instead of increasing the monitoring of drunk people at midnight.

Date of stay: May 2023,Lisa-Marie,Affordable hotel in a great location!,"This iBis hotel is well-located, just a few steps away from hawker stands, markets, Bugis Junction and Bugis Plus (filled to the brim with restaurants, shops and entertainment). There is a convenient shop (7-11) nearby for any late-night snacks. The hotel is near public transport but when requesting a taxi, we didn’t wait long at all.

The front-desk staff are efficient, professional and polite. I found my interactions with them to be pleasant.

The room itself was comfortable: simple yes but to be expected for an affordable hotel. The bed was very comfortable, linen clean. Tea and coffee making facilities in-room. Plenty of storage and shelving space for your clothing. The housekeeping staff are very efficient and responded quickly to our request for extra towels. The gentleman in housekeeping was very respectful and polite. You can tell he took customer service seriously. The view from the room was pretty cool, I love the mix of urban vs traditional architecture of Bugis.

Advantages:
*Affordable
*Good location
*Fun area to stay in
*Laundry
*Clean, comfortable room

Area for improvement: A deposit was taking during my stay which is not typical for ACCOR members of Gold and above status. Not a major issue but would good for the hotel to keep in mind for future guests. I would also recommend reviewing the doors for noise-insulation as I found voices in the hallway echoed through the room a bit loudly.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",88 ,4 ,4.0,

But….. no pool, rooms don’t have opening windows and the aircon made me ill straight away, I’ve not had a cold or illness in 3 years and within a nights sleep I was hanging out.

The staff are nice but the check procedure is unbearably long, if there’s a few in front of you, then you’re just stood there for ages. Check out time is manic, they could easily stagger it. Laundry is 12 bucks self service. The rooms are comfy but just horribly stuffy without proper airflow.

You don't see this even in 5 star hotels that.charge a bomb.  They looked into every detail like 15 mins promise to fix any issue you have.

There was a connection door from the bathroom to another room and I could hear everything. Luckily there was a glass extra door in order to isolate the bedroom. This was also useful to isolate from noise in corridor.  My room was on the temple side which was very quite. The other side is on a main road.

Date of stay: February 2019,ktchye (Kee Thuan Chye),My home whenever I'm in Singapore (by Kee Thuan Chye),"I very frequently return to Ibis Bencoolen when I visit Singapore because it is strategically located.

It is close to lots of eateries covering a wide range of cuisines from Singaporean to Chinese to French to Mediterranean.

The shopping malls Bugis+ and Bugis Junctions are within walking distance.

So is Little India where I go for my favourite briyani rice and other culinary delights.

The best thing of all is that Ibis Bencoolen has quick access to several MRT stations. The nearest is Bencoolen station for the Downtown Line. Also nearby are Rochor and Bugis stations for Downtown and other lines. A fourth station is Bras Basah which is only a 5-minutes walk from the hotel. Just a little farther away is Dhoby Ghaut station. How convenient to get places, isn't it?

On top of that, right in front of the hotel are also two bus stops. I can't think of any other hotel in SIngapore that is so conveniently served by public transport.

As for the hotel itself, it is clean, the service is prompt, the staff are always friendly. I can find hardly any complaints to make against it.

That's why I invariably make it my home when I'm in Singapore.

Date of stay: January 2019,Devdatta T,Great hotel at an Amazing Location,"I stayed here with my wife during the last week of Jan, for 3 days. It's a great hotel, and I had selected it for it's central location.

First the pros:
•It's centrally located with 3 different MRT stations in walking distance.
•There is an 7-11 right next door for all your basic requirements.
•We had taken the Stay+Breakfast plan, and the Breakfast has a large spread, with something from every kind of cuisine, so no one ever feels unsatisfied.
• Our room came with an 'Handy': a mobile phone with internet, and unlimited calling. We didn't use it much since we had local sim cards, but it can be quite useful for those who need it.
• Our plan also came with late checkout, which was extremely useful, since we had a late night flight.
• The housekeeping was prompt and thoughtful, and they even brought bottles of water for us, when they realized that we were out of water.

Now the cons. There are 2 things which prevent me from giving it 5 stars:
•The rooms are tiny. Many other people have mentioned this in their reviews, and I was skeptical of how bad it would be, and once I got to the room, I realized it was bad. The management might say that the sizes are standard across ibis, but practically speaking they are too small for 2 people. You have hardly enough space to open one bag, forget two. Even while getting ready in the morning, my wife and I were often in each others way.
•You should know that the toilets do not have a bidet/health faucet/jet spray. Yes this might be usual in most Singaporean hotels, but can be difficult for Asian Guest",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Pune, India",9 ,10 ,4.0,

Booked this hotel based on reviews posted on trip advisor. the hotel is located on the central Bencoolen street. There are three MRT stations close by, Bugis, Bras Basah and Bencoolen within walking distance. there is a 7-11 convenience store located within 25 m of the hotel entrance. The Pros: Extremely smooth and convenient check in. Extended my check out by 2 hours without payment. Very polite and friendly staff, especially Mr Edwin at the check in counter, Mr Ned, the chef, Rumesh and Fathima at the restaurant. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. The linen was changed daily and room cleaning staff were very polite and more important, very very honest. On one day we left a lot of money on the table by mistake, nothing was  touched. Cons: The rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny. But I believe, that is how it is in singapore. The breakfast menu is boring, its the same everyday. If you are indian, there is only idli, iddiappam and vada for breakfast. the sambhar is in two parts, the veggies and the dal, you need to mix them to make the sambhar. Not a very good part, no chutneys. You could do well by making better better sambhar and adding coconut chutney to the breakfast. For lunch and dinner, there are NO indian options. So bottom line, great place to stay, good services, very friendly staff, super smooth check in and check out. If Indian, unless you are comfy with continental food, food will not be upto your liking.

Date of stay: November 2018,lost soul,Good hotel in a very good areas,"We booked the Ibis on Bencoolen street after reading the review. Good hotel this is review is from a liesure travelers point of view

Room size as per Singapore Standards, those used to big hotel may find this cramped, but from what I've heard the room sizes in Singapore is pretty limited.

Amenities - You get most of standard amenities, I'm sure for the extras you can contact the hotel they should be able to provide. The only flip side is they don't offer bottled water. But, then again the tap water is fit for consumption so carry a bottle around. Alternatively, they have on option to either purchase/loan a bottle in which case you get free refills. We never opted for those. They have a kettle in the room for hot water but for Indian i recommend you get your supply of coffee tea and milk powder. The one's provided in the room may not suite your requirement, the creamer provided (read milk powder ) has a vanilla flavour ot it, which doesn't quite go well with coffee and tea. The coffee powder may not suite a seasoned coffee drinker and the tea sachet is not for us Indians who drink milk tea. But, i'm guessing this is the scene in most hotels here. We however, brought our supplies as we foresaw a possible problem here, so no issues. .

Food - The menu seems to cater a diverse population which is ok for vegetarians, but one has a lot of options close by. We never had the food there. If you are a vegetarian, and an Indian, Serangoon road is not far off, its a 10 min walk you have tons of food options there.

People - Polite and pleasant, they will do what is within their power to help you.

Flexibility - They did offer us an extension of 2 hours during check out, from what I under stand this discretionary and subjective. Although, in our case, the first day of arrival while we had a check in from 2 PM, we did only arrive at 4 AM the next morning, did this to get a confirmed early check-in

Connectivity - Its connected by three MRTs - The Rochor, Bencoolen street, Bugis are all within manageable distance.

Who should stay - I'd recommend this place for Indians, as the hotel is neat and clean, rather new, close to Indian food options especially Vegetarians. I personally, having visited Little India wouldn't pick a hotel there. This place is close to it but not in it. So would recommend this place.

What they can improve - The creamer options should preferably be neutral in taste to accommodate tea and coffee drinker (My personal opinion though!)",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Bengaluru, India",34 ,10 ,4.0,

This was not the case which I could prove by the confirmations from hotels.com. In any case, they could offer us another room instead. The day after check in I noticed that a reservation of some 162 SGD was made on my credit card in the name of Ibis Hotel. This was in addition to the reservations for the room charges of 998 SGD as well as a deposit of 200 SGD. I contacted the reception and told them that the intended charge was wrong. They could not give me any reason for the error and did not do anything about it. The day of our departure from the hotel the reservation was converted into a charge. I  contacted the reception, this time a Mr. Simon. He said that they had nothing to do with it and did not do anything about it. I have later received compensation from hotels.com, which I appreciate very much. I sincerely hope that there is a good explanation of the mistake made by the hotel.

Location - perfect!

Room - I don’t remember staying in such a small, poorly outfitted room but it was sufficient for a couple of nights. No safe. No water. No mini bar. Bed seemed warped in the middle but it was okay. The room made me want to get out of the room :)

Breakfast - nice range of offerings but miss the peak times. Like feeding time at the zoo. 6:30 am is the time to be there!

Bar - very nice and superb service.

Front desk requests - The IBIS advertises 24 hour bar service, but I think this incorrect. I tried to get some water early in the morning and they told me quite bluntly to come back at 7:00 am.

Gym - it’s across the road at the YMCA and it’s amazing value for money. Great free weights, good machines (treadmill was very good) and very nice staff.

Would I stay at IBIS old town again? I’m really not sure. Certainly not in the room type I was in, but maybe there is an upgrade option. I’d stay for they gym and the very good bar service if the bed was a bit better!",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Seoul, South Korea",11 ,7 ,3.0,

The breakfast offers a huge buffet range and you will not go hungry. Rooms are a little small, but we were hardly there so it didnt really matter. Rooms come air conditioned - which you will need, as it is hot in Singapore. The rooms were also very quiet, we didnt hear a peep from outside or in the hallways. The area was safe too, never felt intimidated. Our shower didnt work when we turned it on, on arrival and they swiftly moved us to a new room with a working shower, so very quick to ratify the situation. Staff were very helpful and informative. They explained everything we needed to know and more, we were very impressed with their service. Make sure you rent an ""EZ Link"" card from reception ($10.00 refundable deposit). It was the best way to get around (and cheap! we spend $17.00 each on transport for 6 days and we covered a lot of ground) and any money you put on the card that you don't use you can spend at the seven eleven next door to the hotel.

Best location near Bugis & Bencoolen MRT stations (walk 5mins) & a few bus stops right at the hotel. Connects you to the airport & everywhere else easily!

Though rooms are small (maybe 16-18sqm) and basic queen bed, ibis compensates with their genuine TLC and thoughtfulness. Even without asking, they strive to offer their best! Everyone was professional, courteous & pleasant to deal with. Well done Ibis! Special thanks to Mohan at the priority check in counter!

If we had to nitpick, here are some pointers that ibis can consider to improve:

1) King sized bed :)
2) Better sound proofing. Every morning we could hear guests & housekeeping talking at the corridors as early as 6am!
3) Better air-conditioning system. The first night we had trouble adjusting the air-cond & room was freezing
4) Gym & pool :)

The location is good for day trips but the room is so tiny, we were unable to open 2 suitcases at the same time.

The breakfast (which we paid extra for) was horrible! Western and Asian mixed but everything was stale and tasteless.
Items include rock hard croissants, bread, rice, beans, noodles, dhall, curries, steam buns deli meat and sausages.

My husband found a long black hair in the noodles and showed it to a member of the kitchen staff who took it and walked away without saying a word! A photo of this is included below.

We were turned off at breakfast....but wait, it gets worst.
On our 2nd night, I took a shower without checking to see if bath towels were provided and lo and behold, there were none!
We called house keeping who took 10 minutes to bring bath towels) by this time, I had already used my tea shirt and tissues as a bath towel. In my opinion, this is unacceptable!

We had to put our cases on the table but this wasn't a problem as we only slept in the room.  The room was very clean and the towels were changed at your request.  The beds were extremely comfortable. Breakfast was more than adequate with everything that you could require and was good value.

Maybe my expectation was not right but I can only base it on previous experience from other hotels from other countries all over the world. The quality of food at the hotel was alright but at times it was impossible to get a table during breakfast. I initially thought the restaurant was quite expensive but after a few days in Singapore my view is that they were fairly priced. There were a couple of Mamak restaurants across the road and other restaurants and bars next street up.

I stayed during lunar new year so not sure if that had bearings on the level of service. It is located in Bugis but the nearest MTR station to the hotel is actually Rochar.

On arrival though it had not been taken into account and I was about to be allocated a room near the elevator. After searching I was given a room mid height, but still not in my desired location.

Our daughter was in Singapore 4 months earlier and stayed on Middle Road, where she told us to stay. I reluctantly booked here, but found this to be an excellent location, after actually experiencing it for myself.

The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.
The room was comfortable, clean and without any issues, and you could get plain or sparkling water refills at the Bar area counter.
There is a self-help laundry on the 3rd floor, which is convenient, as we came from Bali where we stayed a few days and after a week ran out of clean clothing. Only found this out on the last day of our stay.

Bugis Shopping area is a minute away, where there are quite a variety of eating venues. Also Little India is in short walking distance.

Bugis & Bencoolen MRT stations are about evenly spaced, and depending which part of the City we explored, we could use either. Would definitely stay here again when in Singapore due to convenient location, for our needs, which is the shopping thing.

We did the ParkRun at East Coast Park on the last Saturday of 2017, and Grab fees either way was about SGD8 from hotel.

Numerous times, the access cards to the rooms did not work so we had to go to reception to reprogram the cards.

The twin bed is only 3 ft unlike the 3.5 ft at most hotels. Pillows are too high; low pillows should be made available, too. Soundproofing at the rooms could be improved upon. Shower water pressure is strong. Because of the slight gap between the shower door and the wall, bathroom floor could be wet.

Availability of EZcard is excellent. However, 2 of the 8 EZcard we borrowed did not work.

One thing I noted on this occasion, which I had not experienced before, was the room level noise factor. Indeed in my booking request I had noted a wish for a high room and end of corridor. On arrival though it had not been taken into account and I was about to be allocated a room near the elevator. After searching I was given a room mid height, but still not in my desired location.
The inevitable occurred whereby groups of people would arrive at their rooms late at night. This was amid noisy and continuous conversations as people seemed to go from room to room. The next morning around 0600 the same issue occurred yet again as guests seemed to move back and forth between rooms . On my second night similar noises occurred yet again.
It would seem Ibis has this as an ongoing problem as I then noticed large posters on the accommodation floor requesting people be quiet. Clearly that may be useful only if the guest language is English.
For my next return visit I will insist on a room at the end of the corridor",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Hobart, Australia",205 ,156 ,5.0,

The other noticeable trend is the diminishing freebies which is part of their cost cutting . No more soap , just gel. Washing gel might okay for kids but not the middle aged.

Date of stay: September 2017,Djakawinata S,"Nice location, good service, enjoyable stay","Chose to spend 4 nights at Ibis Bencoolen for a conference in Singapore last September because of its proximity to the MRT station and its location near the city center, convenientto get almost anywhere.

The check in was quick and flawless because thankfully they have a dedicated counter for Accor member, otherwise it’s 3-4 peoples queue on the regular line. They already prepared an envelope with my room card and all the vouchers so it only took less than 5 minutes before I got into the room.

The room is quite small but good enough for the price (for Singapore standard). There’s standard amenities in the room, servicable working desk, nice wifi connection, and most importantly comfortable bed. They provide a usb plug beside the bed so you can charge your phone bedside without worrying about the type of electrical plug (they use type G plug by the way).
There’s a safety box, tea making facility, iron with ironing board, mini fridge (very small capacity though)
The shower box is small but the hot water running nicely.

Around the hotel, there’s a covenience store next door, I don’t know if it’s 24 hours, but it was still open at 11pm. They also provide microwave foods should you need food to grab in a hurry.

There’s a a large food court within 3 minutes walk, mostly provide local food. Bugis junction only 5 minutes walk where you can find many restaurants and toast, egg, & coffee in the morning.

Taxi is not hard to find at the hotel lobby while MRT stations and bus stops are nearby.
I requested for a room at the far end of the corridor and they provide just that, so I didn’t encounter problem with the sound of foot steps on the corridor.

Overall it’s a very nice hotel considering the price range and the location, good service and good accomodation for good nights of sleep.
Just don’t expect facilities such as swimming pool, large breakfast selection, it’s not that kind of hotel.

Oh, one small thing that impressed me a lot. I had a late night flight so I left my baggage at the hotel after checking out. When I collected it later, I spent few minutes at the corner near the reception desk to re-pack. After I finished, I had a handfull of paper waste on my hand. Just as I looked up to search for a trash can, one of the receptionist reach down under her desk and walked up to me with a trash can. I didn’t even need to ask. Excellent awareness!

Good breakfast, but you have to pay for it.","This is my first time staying in an Ibis hotel and I very much liked (1) Their concept of medium price but good rooms; (2) The convenient and inexpensive neighbourhood for large varieties of food and shopping - Orchard Road is expensive and is targeted at tourists who haven't done their homework, (3) The rooms are modern, new, clean and only a BIT smaller than the standard size rooms you would expect in another country - in Singapore, rooms are usually shrunk down a bit, (4) The very friendly staff, and (5) The breakfast is good, but it's a separate charge, which you should pay for when booking your room to get it at half price.

My four gripes are (1) There needs to be two more hooks to hang your towels, (2) The mattress seems to have been crushed a bit due to heavy use, (3) There are no hotel slippers, and (4) The cleaners do not seem to follow the hotel's mission of cutting down on laundry - all towels are changed every day despite them being hanged properly to indicate I would re-use them.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",2 ,1 ,5.0,

Easy to find taxi on the back side area. Those guys who work there, know how to so their job fast. I wouldn't say the same fast for the counters.
Negative for me is the removal of an almost unnoticeable outdoor small garden on the back side,where you could seat on chairs and tables and enjoy in the night a soft drink and your cigarette (for the terrible ugly disgusting smokers like me).

When I booked the rom back in January this year I did inform them that we would be arriving early as our flight landed at 07.30.
Got a reply to say they hoped to have a room ready for us but when we checked in at 8am we were told to go back to reception at 10 am to see if it was ready!!!
After a 13 hour flight all we wanted to do was sleep for a couple of hours not sit in reception waiting for a room.
To cut a long story short they gave us a temporary room s we could get some sleep till our room was ready. 4 hours later we got into our room.
Room was small but basic with a bathroom with a shower cubicle which was not too bad although did complain that one day it was running cold water and not hot.
Bathroom door ad a loose handle which was sorted after we reported it.
Bed was quite comfy with decent pillows. There was a small fridge which was used a lot to store drinks in.
Restaurant had a very limited menu which was disappointing but we did eat in a couple of nights.
There is a Seven Eleven store next door which we did use a bit as soft drinks were cheaper from there plus other snacks we got as well.

the best thing that steals the show is.. they provide a mobile phone to all their guests which makes life so easy specially if u do not have an international no. and this phone usage is complimentary! they have hit the necessity. a great step.
breakfast buffet is quite elaborate. as they were full house with many Indians.. they were actually serving Idli and Dal as well!
cleanliness is good. rooms are small so good if u r staying alone. I stayed alone so faced no problem.location is perfect .. 5 mins walk to bugis Street.
the only disappointment is no basic room service. even if there is no room service at least there should be a provision for help occasionally. they do not even serve water to the room. every time you need water you have to go to the bar. as I was here for work purpose got very busy and did not get time to return bottles everyday rather at night after coming back from office took two bottles. so the bottles got piled up in 3 days. I asked them to clean up the bottles from my room but they said I have to do it on my own. housekeeping won't do it and they are short of staff so no one will help. they infact asked me to bring bottles down in 2 rounds if there are many. I was in 12th floor. this was not possible. next day I figured out a plastic bag and brought bottles down. being a hotel they should have at least few staff to help or housekeeping staff can help as well. this annoyed me a bit. rest was all good",Trip type: Travelled on business,"New Delhi, India",28 ,2 ,4.0,

Date of stay: March 2017,FinPinkkid,"Good Place, I'd stay there again","I stayed here at the recommendation of a friend/parent for my kid's school sports competition. For me, the strength of the Ibis on Bencoolen was its convenient location. It was about an 8 minute walk from the Bugis stop on the Singapore MRT. I really liked taking the MRT rather than a taxi, and I used the MRT to get from Changi Airport to the Bencoolen, then to my kid's sports competition on the other side of the island. It also turns out that it was convenient because when i had to travel to the western side of Singapore, I was going against rush hour traffic, so getting on the MRT was easy and fast and not too crowded.

Another strength was that it was downtown and there was plenty of shopping or restaurants if I wanted that.

I think I also liked that I could walk/run to Marina Bay in about 20 minutes, then run the 5K loop on around Marina Bay. the Ibis is in a relatively congested area, so i mainly walked toward Marina Bay, but after about 10 minutes walking, you're in an area where you can run without crossing an intersection or running through crowds. Marina Bay itself is a pretty decent place to run. Lots of runners, so you don't feel lonely. They mostly run counter-clockwise, by the way.

I paid for the breakfast, and i'm glad I did. The breakfast buffet was good.Fruits, traditional/typical Asian cuisine, so I was pretty comfortable with that. Breads and pastries as well. I tended to skip dinner, even though i could have eaten at plenty of local places. But when i'm by myself, I tend to eat only breakfast (don't really like sttting down to eat alone) and then just snack the rest of the day.

My room itself was cool. The guy at the Front Desk mentioned that it was specially designed and painted by some artist. I like the overall painting, but let's just say that the ""monkey"" on the wall didn't work for me.

But like i said, I'd stay here again, with no problem.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Beijing, China",51 ,22 ,4.0,

Date of stay: May 2017,BrisvegasDingo,"Great staff, the rest very average","We visited Singapore in May 2017. Be warned, while Singapore is usually warm, May brings very high humidity.
We booked the Ibis on Bencoolen online because it looked okay and had a good rate compared to other Singapore hotels. The standard room we booked was tiny. If there are two of you, be sure you are very friendly or turf wars over space allocation may break out. Hanging space (without a door) is only available for about six items.
But the WiFi is excellent as is the air conditioning.
The bathroom is small and the shower is adequate. Our toilet seat was loose causing a little toilet shimmy, however that was fixed on the same day I mentioned it to reception.
If you stay here, keep an eye on your air conditioning settings. On several days the cleaners turned ours down to about 16 degrees Celsius and the fan up to full. If you don't readjust it you are going to freeze. In fairness, this did not happen every day so was probably just one cleaner who liked to be cool when they worked.
If you arrive late-ish for breakfast, say around 10am as we did several mornings you won't find much food left.
One other small grumble, when we arrived, one lift out of four was not working. By the time we left two lifts were out of service causing long waits and very crowded lifts.
All this sounds like we did not have a good time, but the attitude of the staff went a long way towards making this an enjoyable holiday.
The Ibis on Bencoolen is centrally located with many, many cheap eating and shopping places nearby. Probably the best within a 10 minute walk is Bugis Junction. Not only good shopping and food, but there is also access to a train station downstairs.
On a final note, it's easy to get around Singapore. Taxis are very cheap and plentiful. One can normally be found in the arrival area near reception. There are also thousands of Uber taxis around.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",107 ,53 ,3.0,

The curtails effectively block out any light coming from outside which makes it very conducive for sleeping. However, the only down sides were that the bed was not exactly comfortable and the TV is too small.

Our room at the Ibis was a little on the small side, however this is being over critical as we can only commend the Ibis on service, cleanliness, comfort, friendliness and the willing help of staff when asked for advice or a request. The hotel supplies lovely glass bottles of sparkling water which can be topped up at any time during our/your stay - lovely bonus.

Date of stay: May 2017,Observ_R,Sleepless in Singapore,"We spent 1 night here on our overnight stop-over to Penang. On a positive note, we found the reception staff were very polite, welcoming and responsive to our requests. The hotel is also located within a 10 min walk from the train station and is surrounded by lots of places to eat near-by.

However, the bed in our room was extremely uncomfortable …it was not only lumpy, but the bed-end of the mattress appeared to be about 50mm higher than the bed-head resulting in ones feet being higher than their head when lying down. The air-conditioner thermostat also appeared to be disconnected as we could not make the room any warmer….it was either freezing cold, or you had to turn the thing off making the room very hot….we did this about 6 times during the night and got very little sleep as a result.

Unfortunately, we simply cannot recommend this hotel.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Brisbane - Australia,13 ,6 ,2.0,

We stayed on the 10th floor with a view of neighbouring buildings and we could see one of the temples and some of the nearby market place too.  It was a pleasant view and always something to look at.Our room was small but adequate for us.  We had a queen sized bed and plenty of room to move around.  Not much space for clothing and as we were staying 7 nights we would have appreciated a bit more room but it was ok & was not a big problem.The bathroom was lovely and clean with a large shower and room for our toiletries to be unpacked and placed where we needed them.  The room was always cleaned perfectly every day by our lovely room attendant.  Plenty of coffee was left for us and we had a fridge where we kept milk and some snacks from the next door 7/11 store.There was a laundry with a dryer on the 3rd floor which was very handy for us.  We had been on a cruise for 14 nights so needed to do some washing.  We put on the load of washing while we went out for a walk, then dried it while we had dinner in the restaurant.  Perfect! Our room included late checkout (4pm) and a mobile phone with overseas calls & texts and unlimited data so we were able to take that with us every day and hot spot our mobile phone off it.  Super handy for us to google things and also use google maps & other apps.The restaurant served a good breakfast - buffet or continental.  We opted for the continental on the mornings when we had breakfast at the hotel.  We had the buffet once and it was very nice.  Having an Accor Hotel card allows us to have 50% off our food bill except on public holidays.  Very good value.  Vicki looked after us very well in the restaurant and we enjoyed our meals or drinks when we spent time there.  A few of the staff remembered our names when we went to the restaurant and that was really nice.The front of house staff were very helpful and efficient on the front desk at check in and whenever we had a question for them.  Taxis are easy to get at the front door of the hotel and there is also a bus stop right outside the hotel where the hop on hop off bus stops plus regular Singapore buses.  There are two train stations in close proximity too.   Bugis Street is within short walking distance so that is very handy for shopping and food.We loved the Ibis Bencoolen for the price of the room, the great customer service & the location.

Date of stay: April 2017,Ambassador139705,Comfortable n Tension free Stay,"I stayed at IBIS Bencoolen Singapore from 26.04.17 to 02.05.2017 with my family ( 4 Adult & 2 kids). Booked 2 rooms with a request for interconnected rooms. Initially they gave side by side rooms and after 2 days they shifted to interconnected room. THANKS for this. I enjoyed my stay at 9th floor and 16 floor. Top floor is 16 floor..hv much better views in nights.

Positive:
1 Rooms are very clean , new and with adequate equipments / accessories
2 Beds were very comfortable
3 Other reviews show rooms & toilet are small but I felt ok for a place like Singapore
4 Close to MRT Bugis ...Bus stop n taxi stand.

Negative:
Really no negative.
But Early Check in (like 5...7 am) is a issue if you have family n kids. Hospitality room was also not avl on my arrival. However in my case I got rooms at 10 am ( check in as per hotel is 1400 hrs).Thanks to hotel for this.
Drinking water taking from restaurant is not a problem but the bottle given by hotel is very small. Hotel Mngt can issue big water bottles or increase the qty.. Currently 2 per room , not sufficient for a family. Alternatively they can allow filling guests water bottles..1 or 2 per day..Just a suggestion.

Tips:

For Family / Kids : If your flight arrives early...before leaving to airport confirm your room availability/ Hospitality room. Otherwise stay at airport that is more comfortable.

To enjoy IBIS breakfast more...Go to restaurant early☺

Definitely Stay again.Special THANKS to Mr Sanjay....and all reception staff..Other staff pl do not feel bad ...I could not remember your names....

The service is good and all our requests are attended promptly. As the hotel handles so many guests you may have to wait a while in reception to make the request/enquiry.

The hotel offers compliment luggage keeping facility if you want to arrive early or leave late.

Date of stay: April 2017,Khairul I,A Very Sound Sleep at Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen,"The cruel exchange rate in 2017 had made me think twice before deciding to stay in Singapore for a two-day one night trip to the island city-state with my mother, my wife and my sister. Being an AccorHotels member, I decided to stay at any Ibis hotel in Singapore and after browsing through their website, I settled with Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen near Bugis.

There are several reasons why I chose Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen Hotel. Apart from gaining points for my membership (the very obvious reason), another reason is because of its superb location - it is situated within walking distance from Bugis MRT station. In addition, other hotels in Singapore are expensive but for this hotel, it is worth its price.

CHECKING IN

I booked the hotel via AccorHotels.com website and I fully paid the two rooms that I booked prior to my arrival. The advantage of being a member is the ability to do online check-in, which was what I did for this stay.

A day before my arrival, I checked-in online and when I arrived at the hotel, I went straight to the dedicated counter for customers who had checked-in online. A receptionist attended to me and after checking the record, gave the keys to my rooms and all that was settled in under 5 minutes.

CONCEPT

Just like other Ibis hotels worldwide, the concept at Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is modern and minimalist with large window thus giving more light to the ambiance of the room. The hotel has a restaurant and a bar, a launderette and an ice dispensing machine. If you pay more for the extra benefits, it also includes an off-site gymnasium since this hotel, despite its huge size, does not have its own gymnasium.

ROOM

I was given two rooms on Level 12 - specifically room nos. 1220 and 1221. Both rooms are of same size and same design. The room is spacious enough for two people and comfortable enough to put our stuff and to walk around.

There is an iron and an iron board, a safety box, tea making facility, a minibar, a TV and since I paid for extra benefit, a mobile phone called as handy. I will elaborate more on handy below.

The room's lighting is bright and during daytime, even without switching on the lamps, the room is bright enough thanks to the natural lighting from sunny Singapore. The TV has many local channels plus a few satellite channels.

As for the bathroom, it is comfortable and clean. Shower area is separated from the toilet by a sliding glass door and amenities is provided - if not, just call housekeeping and they will be more than happy to bring the amenities to you.

Body wash and shampoo are also provided by squeezing the dispenses. They smell good and when I showered after a long day of walking in Singapore, I felt refreshed. The only setback for me is the fact that the toilet has no water hose. Since Asians normally use water to wash after using the toilet, not having a water hose could be a hassle for some.

BREAKFAST

Let me tell you, I was skeptical when I booked the rooms. I was thinking, should I add-on the buffet breakfast or should I not? I decided to add-on buffet breakfast and I would say, that was the best decision that I have ever made.

There are a lot of choices, from Japanese food, locals delights, Western choices. The croissants were soft and delicious. There are Nescafe machines, coffee machines, 3 types of juices, a wide array of tea choices and ahh.. you will be spoiled for choices! Trust me, the breakfast is amazing.

OTHERS

For my stay, I booked my room with extra benefits which include free usage of bicycles, handy mobile device, early check-in, late check-out and access to off-site gymnasium.

Of all the extra benefits, I found the handy mobile device to be the most useful of all. It allows me to use the device with 4G unlimited data and make free calls to any number in 24 selected countries. Apart from that, I used it as a hotspot for mobile data and it helped me to get connected when I was out of the hotel.

I also found the late check-out option to be a bless. My flight back to Malaysia was at 7.30 pm, so I opted for the late check-out and I was allowed to check-out at 4 pm. Just imagine, coming back from Downtown Core, drenched in sweat but since I could check-out late, I could sleep for a few minutes, took a shower and went to the airport fresh.

As for the WiFi, it is fast and reliable. There is also a 24-hours 7-Eleven just beside the hotel if you are craving for late-night snacks.

In short, I really recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a good affordable hotel in Singapore. The walk-in rate during my visit (April 2017) was SGD 185 per night.

+++++

Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is located at 170 Bencoolen St, Singapore 189657. It is an 8-minute walk from the Bugis MRT station to the hotel. From the station, cross the road and walk through Bugis Junction and walk pass Albert Centre and turn left. The hotel is a minute walk from here.

It is what people, who have experienced Ibis Hotels, would expect. A decent, economical 3 to 3.5-star hotel which is clean, contemporary and not ostentatious or pretentious. Right in our comfort zone.  The Ibis on Bencoolen has become our 'go to' hotel for short and medium length stays in Singapore. This is based upon our decades-long knowledge of Singapore - ie knowing its proximity to local food; access to nearby attractions and convenient transport to others; and choice of MRT stations and routes that will take you to all corners of the island.   Admittedly there are other hotels nearby with similar location attributes. If price is an issue, these others may be worth considering.

It was nice to meet the staff again it was even nicer that they remembered my favorite drinks. There were a couple of new faces, of course, but I failed to get all their names. Henry was really enthousiastic and very (overly?) polite. Kamalyia was no less friendly and made sure that I did not have to look at an empty glass for too long. There was one more staff member that really made my stay in the bar much more pleasant, but I'm afraid that I did not get her name. All I can say is that she usually wore a black uniform. I did not think it would be appropriate for me, an old white fart, to stare for a long time at her name label ... given the location of said label.

Overall, the hotel services were very satisfactory. The only, subjective, negative trend that I found is that the menu in the restaurant seems to offer more and more western (European) foodstuffs and less and less typical Asian dishes.

This Ibis is a tad above the regular Ibis level, and it makes you feel really good to have such good facilities. Rooms are standard Ibis size, but the housekeeping is superbly good and it is all very comfortable and relaxed.

Breakfast has an enormous selection, with terrific fruit and juice selections. After brekky (which goes until 10), the area reverts to 24/7 food and drink - so there is no dinner as such. Just food all day long. Heaps of eating places within 5 minutes slow walk, so you are never hungry or thirsty.

We had a noon arrival at the airport and arrived soon after 1 PM and our room was ready>
We were given an upgrade to the 14th floor which gave us a good view.

The room was clean and provided us everything we needed for 3 nights here.
The downside was the Handy Phone was NOT in the room as it was suppose to be. A visit to the Front Desk was done and we found out because of the upgrade the phone was in our previous room.
The phone was soon provided but when turned on it was apparent that the previous user information was still on the phone.
I did a full re-set of the phone so I could use it. I also did the same thing when I returned the phone as it was apparent to me that this was not being done by the hotel. I would suggest be very careful how you use and what you store on these phones. This was the only downside.

Hotel staff all speak English and can be extremely helpful with instant advice - one query? why don't they have a map of the local area? Some will query smallness of room and 'non availability of water, toileteries etc., WRONG they are available and freely, just ask at reception or if you see the maintenance cleaners, ask them; they are very pleasant and whilst their English is basic it is fun communicating with them.
Singapore water is safe to drink and has no taste, that we could detect.
Small rooms? probably to space wasters, but for experienced travellers, they are large enough to sleep in and rest, after all if you're on holidays why are you sitting in a hotel room? there is a restaurant (24 hours) at the hotel but we didn't try it .. We were not in Singapore to eat hotel food, we go for what the locals eat.
Eating around the area is truly adventurous, try the Albert Centre, 1-2 minutes walk from the taxi entrance of the hotel .. it doesn't look salubrious, but use the stalls that the food servers, preparers are wearing gloves, otherwise take the chance (we did and suffered no ill effects). Be aware that Singapore is a 'nanny state' (thank goodness) so you're safe almost everywhere at any time of the day, just make sure to read their by-laws, some are draconian to other people. Don't change money at the hotel, staff were honest enough to advise against it .. there are plenty of money changers local; make sure they are licensed. Why didn't I give the Ibis on Bencoolen five stars, well if I did it would set a standard others wouldn't try to reach; believe me having travelled the world (over 104 countries at last count, this is the second best hotel we have ever stayed at (The best was the Guobin at Yichang - year ago).

This is probably just the second or third time.....I had so many options when choosing a hotel for my Singapore trip with my wife and 7 year old son. Most of them were in a similar range in different parts of Singapore.....Bencoolen Street, Bugis, Little India.......@ ~ 150-180 SGD (typical 3 star ones with breakfast).

I am glad that I chose Ibis as I wanted to play safe by choosing a good brand like Accor. (I've stayed with them in Europe and India too). The location is so Central - you can walk to Little India, Bugis, Suntec City. Or for areas that are not walkable - there are 3 MRT stations nearby Rochor (7 min), Bugis (10 min) and Little India (15 min).

There are bus stops just outside that take you to most places if MRT is not the preferred option. There are taxis right behind the hotel and a 24x7 convenience store (7-11) right besides the hotel. There are many eateries near the hotel, some of them open 24x7.

The rooms are compact but very clean with all basic amenities. Bed is comfortable, but just about okay for 2 Adults and a 7 year old. The staff is always willing to help. Thanks to the kind lady at the reception desk, we were allowed to checkin at noon - 2 hours earlier. The staff also helped me get print outs of my boarding passes.The breakfast is great - with Indian, Continental, local, Malay and Japanese items available.

Admittedly, I'm a Accor Platinum member so i do get certain privileges. But, I've never had a welcome letter, fruit or two welcome drinks at any other Accor hotel. The staff are very nice and the rooms similar to any other Ibis in the world. But the Ibis Bencoolen is special. Here you get an iron and ironing board, a safe and a free mobile that you can use to make free local and international calls, and that with internet connectivity. And if thats not enough, you can use their bamboo bike to go sightseeing or use the facilities at a super gym near the hotel!

What really makes the Ibis Bencoolen special are the beds. OMG! What a bed! It's the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on at any hotel, bar none.

Has a couple of drinks at the bar after returning in the evening, not much atmosphere but the prices reasonable for a hotel bar.

Date of stay: January 2017,PANTHER029,What a pleasure,"This is a wonderful hotel - It has so much going for it.

As most people note, the rooms are small(ish) but adequate for two people - and very clean. It's reasonably priced for Singapore and the beds are wonderfully comfortable.

It's a 5 minute walk to Bugis MRT, which gets you onto one of the best rail networks in the world. There are 2 bus stops right out front which will take you anywhere in the city including Harbourfront and hence, Sentosa. The hotel is surrounded by shops, street markets and cafes a'plenty. Little India is 5 minutes away in one direction and Bugis Junction shopping centre is 5 minutes in the other.

The bar offers inexpensive western and Asian meals and the in-house breakfast is first-rate. I note that some people think the breakfast doesn't change often enough. I don't think it needs to, given the variety on offer. We were here for 6 nights and enjoyed all 6 breakfasts.

The included Wi-Fi delivers a strong signal with no drop-out. The staff are among the most friendly and helpful I've encountered in many years of travel. If you book a room with 'extra benefits' you will get a free mobile phone for use during your stay and a late (4pm) check-out. Reception will provide you with an EZ transport card for a deposit of $10 and you can load this with credit at the 7/11 next door, which is open 24 hours by the way. And just in case they do close, there's 2 others within minutes.

In summary, the IBIS on Bencoolen is a great hotel, whether you travel for holiday or business.

Just one or two comments on potential improvements...
1. There is very limited storage space in the rooms - although suitcases do fit under the bed fortunately. The Bedside 'table' could easily have an extra shelf added which would make a big difference.
2. The shower is fantastic but I hate those squeezey wall mounted soap & shampoo dispensers.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Gold Coast, Australia",1392 ,548 ,,5.0

I spent few days during my business trip in Singapore in this hotel in January 2017. This hotel is located not too far from the marina bay sands. The hotel offers rooms not too small with a friendly (I can say every staff from the reception, housekeeping and also from the restaurant are so friendly), helpful, and smiling staff along with the must have iron and iron board in room. This hotel is an ideal for the business people who don't want to break the budget!

Thing I like very much.....
I and my colleague had dinner in the hotel restaurant every day. Food and drink were great. But the staffs there were even greater than the food especially the lady named 'HAPPY' who always gave services with her cute smile that made us feel so welcomed.

Things I don't like....
The breakfast area is a little bit small when compare with number of guests they have during days. The breakfast restaurant was so crowded every morning and seems like you need to wain in queue if you get up late!

The WiFi signal is not quite stable in my room located on 8th floor. It was disconnected many times during using it and it's so annoying!",Trip type: Travelled on business,,22 ,3 ,5.0,
Date of stay: December 2016,mchengau,Wallet Friendly Hotel with 5 Star Service,"I stayed here in December 2016 on a stopover in Singapore with family.  We were flying out of Brisbane on a midnight flight to Singapore, I received an email the day before to check into the hotel online which I did.  Surprisingly when we touched down in Singapore I received a text message saying our rooms were ready, considering usual check in time in 2pm for most hotels I was dreading trying to fill 5am-2pm with activities with no sleep.  Arriving at the hotel the check in process started immediately, I was assisted by Ima and Eugene, they displayed fantastic customer service.  Checking in at 6am was a major relief and we were able to get a few hours sleep before heading out.  The hotel seems to have a major green/eco friendly focus, the usual offerings in the bathroom are available but upon request only.  The complimentary bottled water is available at the bar in glass refillable bottles to reduce plastic waste.  There is also bamboo bicycles available for use, EZ-Link (MRT) cards are available to borrow with a $10 deposit.  Not sure on how to receive the balance back after your stay as we forgot to return ours.The room itself was cozy but had enough space to accommodate two people and their luggage.  The water pressure in the shower is a bit weak but this could be part of a green initiative.  Noise isolation is good, I was not bothered by any disturbances or other guests.  The turn-down service staff are very attentive and respect your privacy when needed.The location is great, a short walk away is Bugis Street Market, Bugis+ and Bugis Junction, for the tech lovers Sim Lim is very close.  There was no problem sourcing food and drink close by to the hotel, a food court is just a minute walk from the hotel.  7Eleven is conveniently located next door from the main road entrance with plenty of fast food outlets scattered around the area.  There are also numerous money changers in the area for those in need, we found the best rates in Bugis Street markets.Overall I had a great stay at Ibis Bencoolen, the value for money was great and the customer service was just as good as other 5 Star hotels I have stayed at.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Brisbane, Australia",86 ,109 ,5.0,

Date of stay: December 2016,Anup S,Everything is so right here,"A lot of good things about this place.

Getting to the hotel from the airport:
It was during the peak hours and I was in the hotel in around 20 odd minutes. Cost 24 SGD.

There is taxi park right in front of the hotel.

Checking in
Check-in was a breeze. They also allow online check-in too. If you are an Accor member there is a priority check-in. I got an upgrade for one of the two rooms and I now had both rooms with extra benefits.(late check-out.. Smartphone with unlimited calls and data). The elevator to the rooms are large enough to accomodate large luggages

The rooms:
The rooms are not too big, but I wasn't complaining. Everything was neat and spick-span.

The staff: The staff all round the place...The bar.. restaurant..Counter are all very friendly. Their staff had some YouTube videos on places to eat and shop, in and around bugis which was good info for me. The staff will help you out of you are venturing around the city on your own and are looking for tips and help

The location:
Very convenient to access all the places of public transport.

Bus stop is right outside of the other entrance, taxi stand is just outside too. MRT is couple of minutes of walk. There is a 7-11 store just next doors. ATMs are on the next block.

Places like little India, Albert's hawker center, bugis shopping lane are close by.

The food:
The breakfast spread is amazing, although a bit repetitive. The service is prompt. There are vegetarian options too. The food at the restaurant is great too, unless one would want to indulge in the street flavours of Singapore with a couple of steps of walk to the hawker center.
The drinks at the bar at good, although they were out of stock on couple of ones.

The Christmas decorations made the lobby a beautiful sight.

Useful stuff:
They provide unlimited refills of water bottle which you can take away until checkout.

Kiosks for self help to get across the city

Free WiFi and Internet access via computers in the lobby with printout facility

Free bicycles.

If you opt for rooms with benefits, then you get a smartphone per room which you can carry around with you until checkout and it has unlimited calls and data free. So you won't need to buy a new SIM card or activate roaming.

Would definitely be my first choice for a budget hotel.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Paris, France",83 ,6 ,,5.0

I selected the hotel as it had a great rate but also was in an area I was keen to explore.  My short stay was very pleasant, check was highly professional and friendly and my room although small and basic was everything I actually needed.  Most of my days and evenings were out with friends, so I came back to my room to refresh, shower, relax and sleep.  Top marks to IBIS for their selection of beds and bedding, I don't think I have slept better in years!  I was also very impressed on the complimentary smart phones that come with your room, which is virtually a mobile handset with free international calling and internet from anywhere in Singapore.  Wow amazing what a great service!  The hotel was extremely well located close to Bugis Street, Bras Basah, Raffles City, Little India and tonnes of shopping left right and centre.  There is a bus stop at the front door and a mere 5 minute stroll through Sim Lim Square to the nearest MRT Station.

It also has very fast wifi connection.

There will be no plastic bottled water provided in your room so make sure you go to the bar on G floor and ask staff to give you glass bottled water for free. Yes, it IS heavy but they really do care about environment :)

Date of stay: October 2016,Love_Life_Sydney,Water views at the Ibis!!!,"You would not believe it but I had water views, although the smog made it difficult to see the horizon. I had a room on the 16th floor, facing Waterloo St. It took me the 2nd day to realise as I knew I was far from the coast by but sheer coincidence, I had a direct line of sight between tall buildings of a shipping lane. I could see cargo ships.

What an excellent hotel .Surrounded by hundreds of small shops, eating places and a few modern shopping malls.

I arrived at 8:00 am, not expecting a room. Abi took my details with no fuss, keys handed to me and I was semi-conscious within a few mins. A courtesy call advised me the name of the nearest doctor. Two mins later the Sales Director, Glenn Matthew, brought a tea with honey for my coughing spasm which probably horrified everyone in the lobby. This act of service was unexpected and I give the staff 5 stars.

The rooms are small as was my room rate. I loved the eco-friendly theme and am happy to use pump packs. You could request for extra bathroom amenities.

Incredibly wifi is strong with unlimited devices. Fastest I ever experienced in any hotel. Bathroom water is drinkable and you can top up with still or sparkling water from the bar. Eco friendly bicycles and umbrellas are available.

Extra shelving space in the bathroom would have been ideal. Recycling bins for papers and bottles would also help.

There were plenty of taxis and there is a bus top right in front of the hotel that goes to Orchard Road. I understand there is a bus pass you could borrow and top up yourself.

There is a Chinese and Indian temple right behind the hotel. Bugis St is about 5-7 mins walk and Bugis Junction has a lot of western style shopping. There is a 7-11 next door and just a few doors away, there a shop that sells fresh bread sandwich with kaya/butter/peanut butter topping for $1. We had a great Singapore toast set (2 soft boiled eggs, 2 kaya/butter toast and 1 tea/coffee) for about $2.20 at the Albert Centre.

There is a dedicated desk for Elite Club Accor members which made checking in very easy. We had already been upgraded, which at this hotel means the same room but with added features, including slippers, a fruit basket and other amenities. The most useful was the use of a smartphone during the stay, allowing you to make free international calls as well as using 4G while out and about. (Tip: I used the phone as a mobile hotspot. It stayed in my pocket and I tethered my own phone to it.)

Other than that, the room was basic Ibis with a fridge.

We got a promotional rate that included the breakfast buffet. It was vast, with offerings from around the world to cater to most cultures (eggs and bacon of course, but also dim sum, sushi, curries, noodles, pastries and even a salad bar among many other offerings),

The hotel is very centrally located and you can easily walk to many places like Clarkes Quay and Fort Canning Park at the other end of Bencoolen. The Hop on Hop Off nus tour has a stop right in front of the hotel.

As advised on the Singapore forum, we mainly used taxis to get to further flung places, like the Night Safari and from and to the airport, and this worked well.

The hotel has a self-service laundromat which we used.

Date of stay: September 2016,Paul O,GREAT STAY,"I stayed at the Ibis about 3 weeks ago and found everything to be as described in previous reviews. No it does not have all the frills which bigger (and more expensive) hotels may have. But you get a good sleep and its clean and tidy. The outstanding feature is the service - by people who are always smiling. The rooms are not very big but quite ok for me (I was on my own). Two people with a large suitcase each may find it a bit small. Breakfast is quite adequate and the steak I had at night for about SGD$20 was also ok. I ate in the room but had to get it myself after ringing to order it. In Singapore it is highly likely there will be a downpour and the hotel lends free umbrellas which are very large when opened - it came in handy. The hotel fronts onto busy Bencoolen street and a local bus stops at the front door. Across the road and down bit to the right is a Burger King. Just next door to the right is a 7/11 with a variety of goods including beer albeit run by a grumpy woman. If you walk just another few metres past her shop just around the corner is another much smaller 7/11 where the beer is cheaper. At the back of the hotel is another entrance where cars and taxis arrive. A very short distance away is a street market and two temples. A bit further is a hawkers market followed by the very interesting and cheap Bugis Street market where I bought a couple of SGD $ 10 watches. When I left to catch a taxi to the airport I was given priority over other people because I was going to catch a flight, and they werent. An example of their service. The taxi took around 25 minutes at 9.00 am and cost about  SGD$20.

Date of stay: October 2016,CMThai,Excellent Value - Great for Vegetarians,"I see another review saying 'there's nothing special about this hotel'. I wonder what they expect at this price point in Singapore?!? What you will get are small, clean, and comfortable rooms with good wifi, friendly staff, and a decent breakfast. You won't get a gym or a pool or a bathtub or amazing views, but if you want that and you want a 'special' hotel, then you can spend 4 or 5 times as much and move to a 5 star hotel.

The location is very easy as far as getting around by taxi, but it's about 10 minute's walk from Bugis MRT. There is a 7-11 downstairs and if you're a vegetarian, you're in luck. About 30 seconds away at Fortune Centre there are 4 or 5 EXCELLENT vegetarian restaurants. Choose from Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. I would probably stay there again for this reason alone.

The only fault I can really find is that when my neighbor turned on the water in his bathroom, I could hear the sound in the pipes. That's enough to wake me up. For most people, they won't notice. Also, it would be great if certain parents of certain nationalities would prevent their kids from running up and down the hallways yelling at 10pm, but I can't really fault the hotel.

All in all great value and will stay again.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Bangkok, Thailand",63 ,90 ,5.0,

It is well connected to public transport and the metro stations are also a short walk away. Location is good and I would recommend it for that.

The rooms are very very small. I guess that is how it is if you stay in the city centre. My room was small with basic amenities. The bed was comfortable. Toiletries are attached to the bathroom wall and are okay. The bathroom had a weird odour throughout my stay, which was very unpleasant. However, I did not complain about it so do not have feedback on that aspect.

There is free wi-fi and it works well across the hotel. There is a large breakfast buffet spread. Food was strictly OK. The non-Asian cuisines needed a lot of improvement.

They have the option of loaning you a metro travel card at no extra cost except the cost you pay to top-up the card. That was very convenient and much appreciated. The staff across the hotel was very pleasant, friendly and helpful.

Overall, it is a decent hotel to stay in the city centre due to its location but at the price paid it should be possible to find alternatives. Though I think the room size would remain the same everywhere.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Mumbai, India",250 ,157 ,4.0,

The rooms are standard as any other Ibis hotel - compact with little space to move around, but equipped with all the amenities you need and a super comfy bed. The bathroom is spotless and the shower has sufficient space. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast should you opt for it - the spread is great and a mix of continental and local cuisine. There's also a vegetarian corner with 3-4 different items, plus there's fruits, breads and beverages so Vegetarian/ vegan folks can fuel up well. There are also 3 vegetarian restaurants right outside offering local & Japanese cuisine, bubble teas, smoothies, etc. which was great! The location is super convenient. There's a bus stop right outside the hotel which will take you to most places you need to go and you can reach most tourist attractions & shopping centers like Orchard Street, Chinatown, Marina Bay, etc. within 10-15 mins. Bugis Street is 300m away. Sentosa is about 20 mins away by cab depending on the time of day. There are a ton of restaurants within a 500m radius and atleast half a dozen 7/11s for anything else you need.

What I really appreciated was the staff - they were very friendly and helpful. The hotel offers a handy phone in the room that has 4G and can be used during the stay for no additional charge. The handy was almost a mini guidebook with interesting write ups on different neighbourhoods & attractions and even offered discounts on tickets if booked through the phone. We did that and took it everywhere with us. It negated the need to have a local SIM with data. I've never had anyone else offer this before, and I really appreciated the gesture.

If you're in Singapore sightseeing and only need somewhere to place your head for a few hours of kip then this might cut it, but if you need to spend any length of time at the place, avoid. On top of that, the shower didn't work which wasn't a good way to start an early workday.

Sometimes in a large busy city hotel you feel a bit out of place when you are in vacation mode, being casually dressed and more relaxed than other guests. Here the staff made us feel really welcome and were happy to spend time chatting, giving directions etc ...... while still meeting the needs of the fast paced business guests.
The hotel is well appointed and had everything we needed for a short stopover stay - a bar and restaurant, a guest laundry, an iron in your room, umbrellas available for loan, and even a local smartphone with internet that you can take out with you.
The location suited us as Singapore was our stop over on the way to and from Europe. In this part of town we could shop, eat out, and easily access transport to sight seeing opportunities further afield.
Rooms are not large but very well designed to maximise the use of space and not feel cramped. And we slept well due to the comfortable bed, great curtains and lack of external noise.
We returned to the hotel after 3 weeks in Europe and received a warm welcome from familiar staff, so it really was like coming home and most welcome after a long flight.

However, we were ok with Chinese dishes and Mcdonalds. As we had visits to hot spots everyday, so we had our lunch and dinner in convenient food courts on those locations.

Short strolls are very pleasant in the evening and I'd highly recommend eating at Fatty's nearby (one of Trip Advisor's top 50)

Wi-Fi was bad the first day and then improved significantly after that, rooms are tiny, beds comfortable, but the whole atmosphere of the hotel seemed to be rather dreary. Perhaps it was the colours in the room and the decor, or the lack of a view but it felt depressing and I disliked coming home at night to it. This oppressive feel in the room also made it difficult to sleep at night as it just left you with an unsettled feeling that for some reason, you weren't alone in your room.

The hotel was otherwise clean, spotless and I kept wanting to like it. The service, as is the case with Singapore, was also impeccable. I do like that this hotel is sustainable and loved the pens, and free soda water that they dish out. The on-demand toiletries didn't bother me or shampoo's in fixed dispensers.

Breakfast wasn't included in my package which didn't justify staying at this hotel compared to the others I was looking at for the price.

There is a good-sized downstairs bar, which we used for informal meetings and also an on-site restaurant.  Next door is a 7-11 convenience store, useful for snacks and toiletries.

The set up of the lobby is sparse but nice, with seating and the restaurant off to the side.

The bed was comfortable, the shower took some time to heat up but was ok once the hot water got there. Service of the towels and bathmats were a bit hit and miss, some days one, some days two, and a hand towel would have been appreciated. Nice guest laundry on the lower level.
Food at the restaurant was ok, not spectacular but filled the need, it was a little expensive compared to other restaurants in the area. The hotel has environmentally friendly glass bottles which you can get a free water refill at the bar anytime, a nice green initiative, but a little heavy to carry in your backpack if you are out for the day.

Upon coming back to my room in the evening, I have just noticed that there are no drinking water bottles and amenities kit available in the room. I thought the house keeping have forgotten to replace them upon the last guest checked out from the room. I rang the front desk just to learnt that they do not provide drinking waters bottles for house guest and guest can loan a bottle at the ground floor restaurant. The bottles can be refilled unlimited at the restaurant and are required to be returned upon checking out of the hotel. Also the amenities kit can be provided upon request. As a guest of the hotel, I feel that this is the basic needs for all travellers and guest at any hotel. I feel the service provided is not up to the standard for the room charges as the room charges are not that reasonable for a 3 star hotels. However, the hotel is located 5 minutes walking distance from the Bugis Streets whereby all the local delicacy and mall are located. Taking taxi from the hotel is not a problem as they have a back entrance whereby taxi drivers can wait for their passengers. During peak time, it is difficult to get a taxi at the hotel.

The cabs come from a back small alley which might feel weird but the hotel is great. The other entrance opens towards the main road with no parking probably that is the reason for the other entrance.
We checked for an early check-in via email and they were quick to respond. They told us they will help and provide one if available on that day. Unfortunately there were a lot of people checking out that day (some group) so early checkin was not available. They kept our bags in the luggage room and we roamed around and did some street shopping. There is a 7-eleven right next to the entrance if you need to buy anything.
Bugis is the closest train station which is a 5-10 min walk from the hotel which was convenient as we were travelling on our own. If you are ready to walk a bit, you can go to Little India for food/shopping.
The hotel room was a bit small but believe me had everything you needed! The staff was helpful and courteous throughout the stay. One thing that we found strange was we asked for some plates to the room around 9pm but were told to come down to the restaurant to take them! This was probably the only strange thing.
There is a restaurant at the ground floor which servers a good breakfast in the morning. We had our dinner on one of the days in the restaurant and found the food to be good.

Date of stay: April 2016,IvanCP91,Not very impressed,"When my partner and I booked this hotel we knew it would be a bit basic, and basic it was. There were a few things that happened during the stay that took away from the experience, and we probably wouldn't bother staying here again.
- Opted for online check-in, that touts that the key will be ready for pick up on arrival. Arriving at around 7:30PM, there was no key waiting and check-in took at least ten minutes. On the check-in form, it said check-out time was midday when we had paid for an Extra Benefits room that gives 4PM check-out. We were assured that it would be no problem and would have late check-out, but the staff decided not to change the paperwork (more on this later).
- As expected, the room was quite basic. A small but reasonable choice of tv stations available and the handy phone was very useful. One of the first things noticed was the bed-side tables are spaced very far from the bed and can't be moved (it seems like the tables are designed for a king-size bed, but these rooms only feature a queen). The room looks really awkward as a result. Power outlets are awkwardly placed as well. There was a double USB outlet and a single power outlet next to the bed (which was taken up with the charger for the handy phone). The only other outlets were on the other side of the room.
- The hotel talks a lot about sustainability and the environment and being 'no frills'. They offer water bottles from the bar, which you can either purchase or borrow and get free refills. The catch is, if you borrow them you are agreeing to not receive fresh towels or linen for your stay.
- Noise from other rooms is quite bad, I could hear alarms going off in other rooms and in the middle of the night anyone entering their room would result in a huge ""boom"" that rattled down the corridor.
- We already knew free breakfast wasn't included with the room we booked, and that it would cost approximately $20 per person. On our final morning we decided to try the breakfast, and did the right thing by standing at the entrance to wait for an attendant. His response was ""sorry, you don't get free breakfast"" and then stared at us, as if implying we couldn't enter, and took some time to mention we could pay, as we knew. Meanwhile, we saw many people (dozens) walk straight past into the restaurant with no one checking to see if they were entitled for free or not. Maybe we should have walked straight in then? After entering, it was incredibly busy and it took 10 minutes for a table to free up for us. This was unacceptable because it got to the point where we were ready to walk out and demand a refund and go elsewhere - payment should not be taken until a table is guaranteed. By the time we left, there was not a single staff member manning the entrance which meant a lot of guests probably got to a free breakfast they weren't entitled to. The buffet itself wasn't anything special, most of the items were cold and soggy.
- Remember the check-out times I mentioned earlier? On the day we departed, we arrived back at the room to pack up at around 2PM. Our key cards wouldn't work in the elevator. Cue us having to go to check-in to get our cards updated because, of course, they were programmed for a standard check-out. If only the staff had done their job the first night.

Overall a pretty average stay. The best things the hotel has going for it is the handy phone offered (which isn't even exclusive to this hotel, we've used one elsewhere) and the location.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",3 ,9 ,2.0,
Date of stay: April 2016,Rusky1,Cannot fault this hotel,"I must admit I've not really used the Ibis brand before this trip. I'm normally looking for
Something a bit more upmarket. However this hotel has made me really-think whether higher prices hotels are really worth the extra.

The rooms were clean and compact- enough space.
The check in and staff were courteous efficient, helpful and knowledgeable about local things to do.
The location is great - street shopping and restaurants + Rochor and Bugis stations are within 5 mins walk. This means you can access any of the sights. We visited Gardens by the bay(20 mins) and Singapore Zoo (60 mins) and we plan to go to the airport by train too. Super efficient and very reasonably priced.
The best bit was for check out. We had a late flight out 10.40 the front desk let is check out a couple hours late at 2 pm and then still allowed is access to lobby wifi and facilities till we left. This included a hospitality room to have a shower before the flight.
I will be using /recommending this hotel again

But check in is running smoothly only I can't get single bed room, the front office said that all single bed rooms are fully occupied so I must stay in two bed room...*sigh* because the bed is really a single bed one. But no choice. I asked for band aid they gave me and I did not bring the slipper, realized there is no hotel's one in a room, I called the front office to ask for it, they said they have it and deliver it very quickly. So it means that hotel' slipper will be available upon request. The room is small but for me that is okay, I won't be in a room for the whole day except for sleeping time, so not a problem at all. Two people are fit in a room. The in-room facilities are okay, they provide the iron, iron board, hanger, working desk facing the window, safety deposit, minibar. I used the iron for ironing my office attire, so it is useful. Toiletries are not fully equipped, no tooth brush but there is a hand liquid soap, bathsoap, shampoo. I do not know whether the tooth brush is upon request too but maybe you can try to ask, luckily at the time I bring my own so that is not an issue at all.
I had a very good sleep here, no problem at all. The breakfast is good, decent food and the restaurant is fit to accommodate the guests, no need to queue to get the table.
I saw there are a lot of business travelers staying here, yes because the hotel location is really very convenient, I have a meeting to Asia Square Tower, Marina View, can take the taxi in 10 mins I arrived there already.

Contacting the back office is just as useless because they use the same system. The property has a minimalist chic with efficient sensibility.

My group originally booked on a sister property (ibis Styles on MacPherson Rd). Through a series of snafus that are out of their control, the ibis Styles could not get their certificate of occupancy in time for their anticipated opening day and our stay could not be fulfilled. Instead, they honored our discounted booking rates and placed us at the ibis Bencoolen. The staff really went out of their way to accomodate my group (it also helped to be an elite member of their frequent guest program).

Date of stay: March 2016,WinnieFamDorde,Hassle-free stay with a good location,"I initially chose to stay in Ibis hotel bencoolen because it is near a train station and the train station (Bugis) is on the airport line and also just a couple of stops away from Marina Bay Sands where I was attending a short conference.

Check in was quick and efficient, and the lobby is very relaxed. I checked in around 4 pm, so it was very quiet. Staff at the check-in counter were quite nice.

One thing to note though, is that they don't provide distilled water in your room. To get them for free, you're supposed to get the bottles from the downstairs bar, where they'll fill the bottles with sparkling water/water for free, and if you would need refills, you can just get them downstairs again. You would need to return the bottle at the end of your stay. I had mixed feelings for this. I don't like the inconvenience, I loved that i can get as much water/sparkling water as I want. It seems this is part of their environmental mission. Also, I didn't find the usual toiletries you can find in hotels, the only thing in the toilet are big squeeze bottles of shampoo, shower gel, and liquid soap.

I have to say, the service was great though! Props to the people manning the lobby in the middle of the night, they were really nice and helpful when I needed help with something.

I also loved the location of the hotel. If you will take the train from the airport, Bugis is nearby. For going around Singapore, the Rochor MRT station is much nearer and a more pleasant walk, which I used numerous times when I was there. We also never had problems with getting taxis from the lobby.

Since I stayed here for business I appreciated the fact that there is an iron and ironing board in the room where I stayed on, perfect for making sure your clothes look good and doesn't have those traveler's creases.

All in all a good stay and i would even consider staying here for pleasure, because of the price and the convenience of the location.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Sydney, Australia",16 ,23 ,4.0,

After weeks of the rest of Southeast Asia we were pretty happy to see the mirror sticker, ""You can drink this tap water"" and it was even kinder of Ibis to offer a refillable water bottle for our day wanderings. Appreciated the mini-fridge, kettle and tea/coffee makings in the room and thick towels. Not a bad amount of room space for Singapore, a bit pricey for the size but, well, that's Singapore.The location exceeded expectations, one of the more pedestrian-friendly areas of downtown, near the Design Centre, Bras Basah mall with quirky bookstores, Raffles, a toy museum, good hawker centres... not far at all from both Arab Street and Little India. Very helpful front desk staff. Fairly priced and tasty snacks in the restaurant, but we decided $21 was a bit much for breakfast so can't tell you about that.

They have laundry and drying machines which we can pay and self-use.4 SGD for washing and 4 SGD for drying. Coming to the drawbacks, the room size was too small.

The hotel itself is very business-like, with efficient staff but lacking in decoration or character.Location-wise this hotel is about 7-minutes walk to the Bugis MRT station (there's a nearer MRT station but on less popular line), passing the touristy Bugis Street market on the way.  If you need a taxi, the hotel has a dedicated taxi stand and it is generally not difficult to get one.Another plus is the gym pass that is included in the room price.

I stayed a night at Ibis for a business trip and the following are the items I hated about it.

1. No bottled water - You are required to go to the lobby and get your own bottle of water. Apparently its to save the environment by not using plastic bottles. They use glass bottles instead however you are required to go downstairs and take it yourself

2. No toothbrush - Since its only a night's stay, you had to call room service for them to bring you the toothbrush and slippers. Terrible.

3. Smallest toilet in the world. - I feel like I am using the toilet of a airplane when I was in there.

4. Worst breakfast ever - Chicken and beef sausage was terrible and the fried noodles felt like I was chewing on strands of straw.

5. Thinnest slipper ever - It felt like the top part of the slipper was made out of toilet paper... terrible....

Rooms:-
The room size is very small. It gave me an impression it was more of a business hotel. The room comes with a fridge, iron box/board and safe. The hotel do not provide room service.

Location:-
The hotel has a great location. it is not very far from anything you would want to visit. Little India, bugis street were all nearby for local shopping and eatouts. Moreover there were multiple hakka center nearby for local cuisines, broadway being the nearest diagonally opposite to the road. Public Transport was very accessible from hotel. NOTE:- Hotel provides ez-link card to all their guest for a 10$ refundable amount with zero value. You can top it up at 7-11 right next to the hotel. This card can be used in MRT, Bus and river cruise. Top it up for 10$/person for a 5-6day trip. I would recommend getting this as soon as you check in. If you wish to visit Universal Studio or Sentosa Island, take a public bus from bus stop right outside the hotel gates. Also while coming back from Zoo/Night safari/River safari, take a public bus back to hotel instead of MRT as the public bus drops you right in front of the hotel gates. All restaurants in singapore mostly closes by 9-930pm including the restaurant in hotel. So plan your dinner accordingly. Around the hotel for late dinners i found a pakistani restaurant right opposites to hotel which is open till 4am. The other option i had was mc donalds open 24*7 near Bugis MRT(~600m from Ibis). We were travelling with our 2 year old and took our baby's pram everywhere. I can't even imagine our trip without that pram now.

Restaurant:-
The breakfast was good with menu rotated alternate days. The weekend menu were different. Restaurant even have a small menu which is served through out night after 9pm or 10pm.

Hotel also provide limited bicycles on first come first serve basis. Try a early morning or a late night stroll to singapore flyer, marina bay sands. Yes it is walkable if you can walk 30-40min. It takes 10-15 min on cycle. Overall my experience in Ibis was good and would recommend it to others.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Irving, Texas",36 ,1 ,4.0,

The twin-bedded room was clean and the daily housekeeping was super; swift to change towels and refill any toiletries on demand.  Safe in the room was easy to use and large enough for passports and valuables.  Bed was firm, good for my back although the two pillows provided were a bit too high for my comfort.  Daily buffet breakfast was delicious, with a good spread of local and Western fare.  The staff was polite and most helpful.  We used the laundrette on the 3rd floor, paying just SGD4 each per load and tumble dry.  However as the room wasn't locked, any public person could simply walk in and use the facilities, as the car park was conveniently on the same level.  So perhaps the Management could put a card lock on the laundrette door such that it's only accessible to hotel guests.Wifi is good and strong throughout the hotel and in the lobby, there is free use of the PC and printer (useful for printing out boarding passes).The location is spot-on - close to the wet market and hawker centre, lots of eateries, a 7-11 convenience store located next door, as well as a short walk to Bugis MRT station.

Location is very central with plenty of shopping (there's a convenience store right next  door) and eating options nearby and Singapore Metro (MRT) is a five-minute walk away. Ideal for tourists or a business visit. Ibis rooms and bathrooms are always 'compact' but unless you need to spend time in the room, other than to sleep, I can't see the point in paying for facilities you won't use or don't really need. This Ibis bed was super comfortable and breakfast was very good indeed with plenty of choice.

Did not use the restaurant (in Singapore you can eat cheaply for the fraction of hotel's prices).

We arrived at hotel from an early morning flight at about 10am. We got into our room at 12pm which was fine. I was offered a lower floor room if we wanted to check in earlier but I opted to wait for the top floor room. Staff very pleasant.
Rooms are not spacious but fine for 2 people. Very comfy beds. Bathroom descent size but only shampoo and body wash provided.. no conditioner.
Refillable glass water bottles are great.You just take them to the bar and they refill with still or sparkling water. only gripe is they could be larger or provide a jug also so you can refill bottles yourself to take during your day out.
The MRT that is advised as the closest to the hotel is Bugis MRT but in actual fact Rochor MRT is much closer. Just turn right out of front of hotel, cross over at first set of lights and walk through Sim Lim square to the Rochor MRT on Rochor canal rd. Bugis is about 3 times the distance once you factor in the distance you walk once down in the subway tunnels to get to the actual station.We only worked this out the last day we were there.. also Rochor station a lot less busy and congested than Bugis.
Good hawker food in basement of Sim lim sqaure. Japanese stall food was good and at $5-6 per meal, great value for a bento. A cleaner dining experience than Albert Court.

I was also disturbed twice in the morning by housekeeping entering the room whilst I was sleeping. It seems the hotel do not have any idea who is checked in and out of the rooms. The room should be cleaned later in the morning or afternoon for rooms which are not checking out on that day.

The hotel room is relatively small but still enough room for the two of us and our luggage. Complimentary water (still or sparkling) is provided with infinite refills. However the bottle was made of glass and was heavier to carry than usual plastic bottles. Nevertheless I appreciate their move towards sustainability!

My room was as expected from the ibis (Accor Group) very clean and tidy, adequate for me, and the housekeeper was on the my floor when I arrived out of the lift, and she had a smile and said welcome to the hotel hope you have a nice stay, thought that was nice of her.

Date of stay: October 2015,Saikat C,"An excellent choice, highly recommended","The best part of this hotel - the location. Its just a five to seven minutes walk from the Bugis Metro station, which is connected to Changi International Airport and only a few stops from popular places like the Bayfront, Raffles, China Town, Clarke Quay, etc. Little India (and the ever busy Mustafa Shopping Mall) is a brisk 10 minutes walk from the hotel. It might be a little difficult to find the hotel for a first timer coming via Metro, so just ask for directions to Bugis Street (which is a cheap souvenir hunting destination). The hotel is nearby.

As for the hotel itself, it is clean and the service is fast, professional and accommodative - as expected from Ibis. A big plus is the excellent buffet breakfast menu, which includes a variety of dishes to cater to different tastes. The Indian spread is quite substantial and even vegetarians will be quite happy. The free wifi is fast and can accommodate video calls without much lag. The free computers at the lobby are useful.

A few downers: the room may feel a bit cramped and the bed is queen sized; the wardrobe is open and quite small (probably planned for people who stay only a day or two), but then the ironing stand is a useful touch. There are very few channels on TV, but I guess when you are in Singapore, who would want to watch TV? :)

Based on the reviews, noted that it was going to be a small room, so expectation managed. The room and sheets was clean. The bathroom is clean and brightly lit.  Feel that the price is slightly overprice for the size of the room.  The hotel was an alternative as my first choice of hotel (few tens of dollar more, but about 30% bigger, and also at a another good location) ran out of room by the time I was given the green light to book.

Both my requests (high floor and away from lift) were granted and pointed out to me at check-in. Though somewhat utilitarian in appearance, the room was a very cool and comfortable base to stay.

1. The Housekeeping staff/supervisor was not attentive enough as I had smell strong herbal oil odor when I accessed the room. In addition, some bed odor was come from the drainage on the floor as well as urine odor in the bath room.
2. The café staffs were also not professional enough. My room package was included the first day breakfast; however, they couldn’t found it and insisted that the breakfast charges should be paid by us. They just emphasized that their report indicated that our package should without breakfast, even though I explained to them several times. Eventually, they got the accurate information after I request them to reconfirm with front desk for details.

The bugis street market is across the street and you can get good shopping options much cheaper as compared to other parts in Singapore.

Next important thing to consider is food. We took the breakfast package. You get vegetarian options too.. 5-6 types of fruits.. Variety of breads and cereal butter jam etc milk, tea ,coffee juices...salads... In indian variety we got dal, idli, paratha,chutney,one mix vegetable,curd, croissants, hash browns, potatao wedges muffin etc. however most of the stuff is repetitive... Each day similar menu by third day we got bored. But still i wud recommend breakfast as it's fast n easy to catch and day can be started early for sightseeing.

Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Our late check out resquest was considered. Rooms are small but clean and quiet, bed is very comfortable.

From the moment we checked in we were made to feel welcome and expected. We like the location and value for money and it is clear that the service is constantly improving.  This time we took advantage of the extras like the 'Handy' phone which gave us unlimited phone calls and Internet while away from the room. This proved to be a game-changer for our stay.  The restaurant is very good without breaking the bank. The rooms are small but well-appointed and clean with useful features like USB ports for charging devices.

Date of stay: May 2015,minskydoo,Overall A Pleasant Experience,"Found the room size to be a bit small (though I think is the standard in Singapore) and with just the very basic of amenities, excluding bottled water probably due to the hotel management's claim that the room's tap is safe for drinking--- we didn't take our chances though.  With that said, the positives still outweigh the negatives, making up for a pleasant stay overall.  The staff were genuinely helpful, especially Dass and Eugene who patiently walked us through with the Accor club membership application and assisted us as well with other queries during our brief stay.  There was another hotel staff (didn't get his name though) who even accompanied us all the way to the money changer nearby.  Another staff worthy of emulation was Christine from housekeeping who had so graciously assisted us when we were having problems with our key cards.  Other pluses: conveniently near most shops (Bugis and Orchard road just minutes away by walk--- or if you prefer not to, one may take the bus which stops right in front of the hotel), convenience stores, attractions and restos; room was spotless throughout our 3 nights stay; security did not seem to be an issue with the presence of a guard on duty; the bed was really super comfy, providing for a restful sleep after a hectic day out in the city.  Another huge plus is the hotel's hospitality room accorded to guests who have already checked out but may still want to roam around the city one last time and may want to take a shower/freshen up before heading to the airport.  Add to all these positives, the fact that the cost per night was surprisingly way cheaper than most other hotels around the area.  Indeed, the Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is value for our money.

Date of stay: May 2015,Ravi Kiran G,Good over all,"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children) were here for 5 nights in May 2015.

The positives of this place?
1) Good location - access to Bugis MRT is 5-10 mins by walk, there is a bus stop right at the door step of the hotel, a 7-Eleven store at the exit of the hotel too (very helpful if you have a little one and need to run in the middle of the night for any thing like diapers, biscuits, etc. at cheap rates.

2) Close to Little India - if you are Indian and are travelling with little kids, then you will definitely appreciate this. My 2 year old boy needs his fix of idly/dosa/rice - and no better place than the innumerable South Indian Vegetarian places in Little India (my personal favorites being Laksmi Naarasimham as well as the MTR - near the Farer Park MRT and next to the City Square Mall).

3) Smooth Check-in and check-out - if you have paid your bills in advance (which you would have if you have booked online), then you just drop your keys in the box and walk out!!! Again very handy if you have a wailing 2 year old and standing in the check-out queue!!!

4) WiFi at excellent speeds for free

5) I would recommend booking the room with extra benefits - they give you a handy smart phone with unlimited calls to India/US and many other countries. Very useful - as I had to call back my office for some urgent issues though on vacation.

6) Pretty good value for money - book directly on their website and you get a pretty good deal. Also, book the room with twin beds and join them - you will get a little extra space for your little ones (rather than the one with the single queen bed).

Negatives - not many

1) Would have liked some more vegetarian options on their menu
2) They could have some Indian options in their menu as well
3) Do note that this is strictly a functional room - with just the right amenities for tourists. If you are looking for a fancy room with a jacuzzi or a pool access, etc. this is not for you.

Overall - I heartily recommend this place to families.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Chennai (Madras), India",102 ,55 ,4.0,
Date of stay: May 2015,An_Believable,"Convenient location, great staff","Stayed here recently and I believe it was a great choice to explore the city. Bus stop at the doorstep, Bugis MRT station about 10 min walk away, also seemed to be well known as a reference point for taxi drivers. The MRT is a great travel option as it is easy to navigate and cheap to use; about SG$1.70 for single trips to say Chinatown or Bayfront and you just reload the ticket for subsequent trips.

I found all members of staff to be very helpful and friendly, from the doorman to the front desk. As we landed at 8:30am, we had the free option of checking in early to first available room but it had two single beds instead of a king so we declined, but we did leave our luggage in their storage room to explore the city until checking in in the evening.

Our room was a small, standard room, though clean and bright and suited us as we just needed a place to sleep really. It's quiet and allowed us to get some much needed rest when out and about in the Singapore heat. The TV had a video on loop that had great suggestions for places to eat or visit if you hadn't checked TA for that kind of info already.

In Singapore someone is serving you steamy hot Idli ... and there is no sambar or chutney to go down with this ... not acceptable ....more to follow is that when I spoke to the service and kitchen staff they showed ignorance and offered me mango chutney which is like a jam or spread to have with this idly at the breakfast table ..... how do you take that

Secondly the shower holder was broken upon check in and the same was not noticed by any of the housekeeping staff so obviously not replaced .. is this a sign of well maintained hotel ... certainly not ...

On previous occasion when I stayed last August I had some issuse reported as well in my review and I think I will never stay here again or recommend this place simply because you get better service and place to stay in similar or less bucks nearby .. why waste money here.. unless I am offered some kind of incentive to stay here ....",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Pune, India",127 ,84 ,3.0,

The hotel is located nearby Bugis Junction and Bugis market. Do try local delicacy at Albert Centre. Do not need to worry about food if you stay here as they will be aplenty. 7/11 is right beside the hotel, a convenient one if your rate does not include breakfast.

We came around 11 AM and was greeted really warmly by Eric, the reception. Eric was really helpful and thorough with his explanation. We were traveling in a group of four people with one infant and booked two non smoking rooms, a twin room (for our family) and a queen room (for us). He allocated the twin room first for us to rest and put our luggage and asked us to wait until 2PM for the other room. Unfortunately, we found that the twin room smelled smoke but our family did not mind so we did not complain. But we still believed that guests should be charged a penalty at check out if you are smoking in non smoking rooms.

We then came back to the hotel after dinner to find that the hotel had given us a baby cot for our little one in our queen room, without us asking or requesting for it. We felt that the hotel was really attentive to their guests' need and was really wowed by their personal touch. We were truly impressed.

The room unfortunately, was a little cramped especially with the addition of the cot. The amenities of the room was standard, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was also a little cramped.

2. breakfast $$$ is big money! i.e. 25$. Get out of their and walk out to get some local food for a quarter of the price.
3. Close to MRT and if you can take the MRT from the airport and save yourself loads of money! its cost like 3$ to get to the airport from hotel! A taxi ride is 25$ and beware they do not take visa for some reason:-(
4. The tour bus stops right in front of the hotel which is fantastic if you want to see the city with the hop on hop off option

This being an Ibis hotel, you can reasonably expect standard rooms as experienced at Ibis worldwide (same size/layout with integrated bathroom area). The hotel provided a baby cot free of charge in room (which slightly decreased usable size). Travellers with lots of baggage should consider storing suitcases somewhere else than the room (e.g. central luggage storage), as storage space inside the room is slightly limited.
One more tip for noise-averse travellers - the fan in the bathroom is hard-wired to central power and can't be switched off. Apart from that though, absolutely reasonable hotel with good service & clean rooms.",Trip type: Travelled with family,,33 ,11 ,4.0,

Our extra benefits room also contained a ""HANDY"" mobile phone, with complementary unlimited local and international calls and 3G data. Very very handy for travelers to call home. The phone can also be used as a WiFi hot spot to couple to your own smart phone.

The hotel has FAST complementary WiFi which requires a user name and password. This is input once for the duration of your stay.

If you obtain a MRT Metro card from the hotel a $10 deposit per card is payable (which is refundable upon return). You need to ""topped up"" the cards for any travel. This card makes Metro travel very very convenient.
Refunds for unused travel top ups are NOT available from MRT ticket booths nor from the hotel. In order to obtain the unused value, you must spend the unused balance at any 7/11 stores.
Travel Cards are able to be purchased at any MRT station for $12.00. Unused travel value can be refunded and the card cancelled, however a $5 admin fee is charged by the MRT office.
Tops ups of metro cards can be made at any MRT Station, with a $10 minimum. The top up machines only take notes to the value of $5 or less and coins. 7/11 stores do allow top ups for $5 however charge a $0.50 surcharge for all top ups.

When arriving into Changi Airport Terminal 2 and 3, follow the MRT signs to the metro station. Trains to Bugis Junction station take approx 30 minutes and cost $2.30. The airport metro line terminates at Tanah Merah metro station, meaning you need to change trains to travel to Bugis.

Ez Transport cards were available at the check in desk with a 10 dollar deposit that you get back after giving the cards back. This is different to buying them from the MRT stations as you don't get the 5 dollars back. This is really worth doing if you want to travel instead of using the day trip system.

You may also order from the Tapas menu with a choice of 3 items out of 11 local dishes usually found at the hawker centres for $17++. This way, you can sample Singapore's hawker food in the comfort of a hotel restaurant.

Alternatively, items from the a la carte menu is also available from $6 onward. So for a meal in a hotel, this is really value for money.

Besides, the hotel is conveniently located in the city within walking distance to Bugis area and just a short bus or train ride to Orchard road or downtown Marina area.

Date of stay: January 2015,JimTrap,Great Service and Location,"We stayed at this hotel in late January/early February 2015 for a total of 5 days before and after a cruise out of Singapore and on both occasions, we could not have been given better service for what advertises itself as a budget hotel - it beats some of the 4 and 5 star places we have stayed in around the world.

We are travelling with my wife's disabled sister and the assistance we have received to make the stay comfortable and to reduce the care issues have been great. From the booking service at Le Club Accor through to the front desk at the Ibis on Bencoolen, staff could not have been more helpful. In particular, we would commend one of the Duty Managers at the Ibis on Bencoolen, Indra, who went out of his way to assist us.

The location in Bugis Junction is ideal for those wanting to experience day to day life in Singapore just outside the doors of the hotel. You can stay in the larger and more expensive hotels in Orchard Road and around Clarke Quay and the like but this area in Bugis is great for restaurants, markets and transport - and the sights, smells and experiences of Asia.

The hotel rooms are on the small side, but they have been well maintained and are functional. Everything works - and the hotel advertises a 15 minute guarantee to fix/address any problem - how good and responsive is that !!??

The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean. A good breakfast buffet with a reasonable variety of western and asian food is available. A great innovation is the offer of bottled still or sparkling water for free - with as many free refills as you want for the duration of the stay - and they supply the bottle. The unlimited free wifi works well throughout the hotel. For the price of a room here, it is very good value.

The hotel staff changed our room immediately when we complained (no apologies). We lugged back up to Level 15, then to realise the fluorescent light was flickering and there was no top bed sheet on the bed. The next morning we asked for these to be fixed. The light was fixed and a sheet folded and put on our bed, a little disappointing and lazy.

For my entire 5 days in Singapore I have suffered from a very sore back due to the bed. My partner also feels the bed is uncomfortable. If you enjoy a quality night sleep over a budget hotel, stay elsewhere. By the fifth night I couldn't sleep or get in a comfortable position in my bed.

Breakfast is good, although not much western variety. Taste, the restaurant is excellent for dinner.

However, if you plan to spend more time indoor the hotel might not be your best bet as the rooms are small. However, the space has been managed perfectly. The buffet spread is good.

I was able to Skype with my sister back in the U.S. easily, once we got the timing right. A couple of blocks from an MRT station (Bugis) which we used extensively, and buses right out the front door. There is no breakfast included and the buffet breakfast was quite expensive so we didn't bother with it.

Location is excellent---- Near Boogies MRT ( 10 min Walk ), Boogies street ( 5 Min W ), Little India ( 10 Min Walk ) - a seven-Eleven store just next to it --
Very near the route of the city sight seeing tour Bus route - SAEX bus stop is also nearby - ( Jurong Bird Park bus stops ( B-005) right next to the hotel ) - for other locations - one needs to check as Bencoolen street is a one way street

Rooms are a little small - with a child we felt cramped at times but but may be it a case with most Value-for-Money hotels in Singapore...and rooms have everything one needs -- a Sitting place, A chair, a vertical storage, a small Fridge and TV cabinet, Tea-coffee maker... Even an Ironing board and Iron....
TIP - arrange your things in storage compartments and put extras under the Bed.....
and TAP WATER IS SAFE TO DRINK - ( I have consumed that for 6 Days - Nothing has happened to me!!!! Do not waste money buying water)

Lobby and services --- Very clean place. Occupant has to carry his/her luggage.....Self services ... Two Rooms Keys are given---- Lift and even common wash facilities can be accessed only by room keys -- Good for many......

Restaurant -- Ample Vegetarian choices for breakfast -- lavish spread and some Indian Dishes like Patty, Rolls, Dal-Paratha, Rice-Curry..served Hot.. Also we were served some specially made rice preparations at our table... Very nice gesture.....

Within a 5 min radius there were a plethora of eating places from the cheap to the expensive. This was great as we had opted for a room without breakfast.
Checking was easy as I was sent an email a couple of days ealier to fill in my details to speed up check in once we reached the hotel.
We were on the 15th floor, there are 4 lifts where you need to use your room keycard to acsess your floor (always good for security). We did find the lifts a little slow to reach us at the 15th floor, but we have stayed in places where it has been a lot worse.
Room was a reasonable size with desk area small hanging space a flat screen tv and a small compact safe. We could just fit a macbook air computer into the safe. Adequate shower room with a glass screen shower.
Comfortable bed, so got a good nights sleep. Room and hotel public areas alway clean.
All in all agreat place to stay with a great location (for us).

Date of stay: November 2014,thegorbs,my favourite hotel in SG,"This is now the third time I have stayed at ibis Bencoolen, I refuse to stay anywhere else in Singapore city!
The staff are always friendly, and go above and beyond to assist, even if the request is a little strange (this time, writing the hotel address in Mandarin for my southern-drawled American friend who was scared she'd struggle to be understood from the airport).
In a standard room, there is enough space for two. It's basic, but there is too much to do in Singapore to be sitting around in your room!!
PROS:
- close to Bugis St markets for fresh juice and a bit of a browse (but go up to level 2, away from the tourists)
- very easy stroll to Albert Hawker Centre for cheap eats
- walking distance to 3 MRT stations (Bugis is closest, then Bras Basah, then Dhoby Ghaut)
- 7/11 next door, Ya Kun Kaya toast on the end of the street
- good happy hour specials
- free, strong wifi!!
- effortless taxis

CONS:
- the bed is a little hard (but I guess that's personal preference)
- no pool, this would take it to a 5! (but again, unreasonable to expect from a 3* hotel)

One major point to improve, since it's the first contact point with the customer: the queue. There is a Club priority counter and a center queue to split customer to the various counters. One would think that a Club card member could go directly to the priority counter and queue behind, as it is the case with Avis car rental for instance. But it doesn't seem so and we were expected to queue in the common lane. Since the priority lane was also even slower than any other lane, I would suggest the hotel to: - organize better the queue lane - make the priority lane a fast lane       ",,"Toulon, France",44 ,17 ,4.0,

On the plus side the location is good, price was okay (for Singapore) and rooms with good furnishings and clean. Not so good - the beds were extremely hard (like sleeping on bricks!) and I was disappointed at times with the staff at the service desk. An example - the hotel actively promotes the fact that they offer a service where you can borrow an EZ link card (you add value as required) for public transportation. After our first two days there we stopped asking about the card as we kept getting told that they didn't have any. Don't advertise/promote something like this if you can't deliver or else add a rider ""subject to availability.""

We are an older couple and were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go including Raffles Hotel, Marina Bay Sands, Bugis Street, Little India.  In fact, walking was preferable to driving anywhere since so many streets were closed due to the Formula 1 race which took place while we were there.  We were able to check in early upon arrival (10:30 a.m.) and check out late (2 p.m.) the day we left.  Staff went out of their way to help with my inability to access my e-mail in the U.S.  The young lady who helped me, tried on the lobby computer where I had moved since neither their smartphone nor mine could access my e-mail and even moved to her computer at the counter to see if it would work there.  Turns out an internet cable tying the U.S. to Asia had broken and prevented access.

Gladly Accor had 40% promotion for their world wide hotel chain. This is why I reviewed plenty of Accor Hotel since I could find their website is quite useful and economics. I hope it will follow by other hotel chain like starwood etc. So far I found Accor is the best.

Back to Ibis Bencoleen, located close to Bugis MRT where I could find easier to have transportation for places that I want to visit. Also there are nice things to be explored in Hotel neighborhood.

The room is typical like other Ibis Hotel that I have ever stayed like Ibis TSM Bandung and Ibis Surabaya City hall. Therefore I didn't have problem to sleep very well., clean and shower is great. One thing for small touch that I really like is the soap ... it smells so good :-)

I found staff also polite and friendly. Too bad in first time when staff gave me card keys. They failed to open hotel room. I tried several times and asked cleaning ladies, it didn't succeed. With some luggage I went back to receptionist to reset the keys. They said due the high occupancy, sometimes the system had lag time from previous guest that stayed in same room and the new guest. I hope it will fix soon.

It is also helpful if the hotel could provide sometimes like first aid. I got headache. Perhaps since in my knowledge I could find something like paracetamol in first aid kit. I asked the receptionist if they have. Too bad they don't have it. I wonder in case of something like fell down, could I have alcohol to clean my wound or cut? or similar like my headache they will refer me to next drugstore?

Date of stay: August 2014,BusyGirl1614,Great hotel only if their card reader is working :-(,"It was my first time in SG and because of the good reviews I stayed in this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights. First the good points:
1. Location - for those who love to shop for cheap goods and good finds, this hotel is highly recommended. Just a 5min walk to the Bugis Street and lots of restaurants & hawkers area (Albert Market Food Center). There's a bus stop in front of the hotel so getting to places is not an issue.There's also a money changer nearby so no issues if you are a tourist.
2. Room is small but spacious enough for 2-3 people as long as you have small luggage. Bathroom is well kept and clean.
3. Wifi is fast and can be used from your room to the lobby.
4. 7-11 at the GF serves one of the best butter croissant I've tasted.You can buy here raincoats for 2 sgd if you are planning to go to USS for the Jurassic park ride instead of spending 4sgd at Sentosa.
Overall, I would have loved to recommend this hotel but there's one thing that I really didn't like because it was an inconvenience for me and my daughter.We were given a room at the 14th flr with a dysfunctional card reader.At first we thought the access cards were the issue so we had them replaced but only to find out the 3rd time that the card reader was the problem.It was not nice to shop all day with your feet hurting and go to your room expecting to rest and can't get in.This happened 3 times and it was not at all funny.Each time we had to go down the frontdesk so they can use the master key where the card reader only seem to work.So again, would be nice to recommend this hotel but because of d card reader, I don't think so.",,"Muntinlupa, Philippines",54 ,55 ,3.0,

Hotel is centrally located on Bencoolen street, 5 min walk from Bugis MRT and well connected to Chinatown, Marina bay, Orchard road, Little India etc.  Good service, they let us do a very early check in. Rooms are clean and offers a good connectivity wireless service.  The only disadvantage is that rooms are really small(!!!) if you intend to stay here as a family and spend time in the hotel. Would recommend this place if you want a good priced hotel for a quick stopover,or you don't intend to spend much time in the room.

In my case I requested for smoking room, which they reserved for me. They also ask what time you will be arriving at the hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11 am and they had a room ready for me at no extra cost. The room has all the basic requirements, TV, Wi-Fi, Ironing board, complimentary coffee and tea.

When i realized it, i contacted the hotel staffs, they are very helpful, especially the manager, he helped me checked the trash chute, i thought maybe the plastic bag was accidently got thrown away with trash, but we got nothing, the manager said, because maybe it happened 2 days before (the last time i saw that plastic bag was two days ago ) he can't do anything, i also asked the maid, she said she won't dare to touch things in the room beside the trash bin and the mattress.

Nice lobby
Tasty breakfast

Bad points:

They allow too many guests in 1 room which again adds to the noise level.
Room given on 2nd stay..had a smelly bathroom and mould in it. We asked to change rooms..which we did.
Not given enough towels. Literally 1 towel each.

The prices skyrocket year by year. Even I'm an Accor Advantage Plus member, the price of USD 125 per night won't satisfy me for the same iBis standard which I can find it in Thailand for just USD 30 per night.

Location is good. Few minutes walk to the back of the hotel will bring you to a famous Chinese temple. Along the small road will lead you to Bugis shopping center. Few steps away from the hotel, you will find two big 7-11 mini mart. And food center is just few minutes from there too.

To catch the MRT, you can walk to Bugis station which may take around 8-10 minutes from the hotel.

The room is okay, as comfortable as other iBis hotels (but not those in China which have lower standard).

I didn't try any breakfast or dinner buffet here. The night staff at front desk said 'I don't know, you should better ask restaurant' ... when I asked her about any discount for A+ member.

Shouldn't she ask for me? Or shouldn't she know this simple information? So I chose to enjoy my lovely view at Equinox @ Swissotel instead.

By the way, Wi-fi in room is good and acceptable. Check in and check out is quite fast. But the price is too high, and that didn't make this iBis hotel as budgeted hotel anymore.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Bangkok, Thailand",138 ,148 ,3.0,

But, I am sorry for the team of Hotel Ibis who works very hard to make the guests happy and the marketing team is there to spoil all the efforts by cheating the customers during booking the hotel.
I booked the rooms from Accor's own website and found a package named ""EXPLORE SINGAPORE"" which stated...
Explore Singapore package inclusive daily Buffet Breakfast, unlimited in-room WiFi, Singapore attraction ticket. Le Club Accorhotels members earn x3 Bonus Points & WIN a drive in a Supercar Ferrari! *terms & conditions apply

One would not assume but will be sure that this package will provide you with the Singapore attraction ticket, no wonder what the type be, but atleast one time ticket for the room occupants to any (not expensive, then a cheaper) attraction. Guess what, I was offered a chance to select a paper from a basket to ""win"" any Singapore Attraction, and the worst part was that I ""won"" a desert for ONE at the Ibis hotel restaurant.
I wrote the email about the whole thing to Ibis Hotel but todate there has been no reply. Even the terms and conditions don't state that you are suppose to win a Singapore Attraction ticket, and you might end up in winning a desert at the restaurant.
When I asked the management at the last night about the ignorance of my email, the junior guy understood all of the scenario and apologized to me, but at that time nothing could have been done to he offered me a free taxi to the Airport, that was nice of him which I think he did at his own expense. But again, a taxi to airport? Can that be the adjustment for the offered MARKETING TRAP?
The marketing team should be replaced because they are spoiling the physical efforts of this good hotel who has a good and hard working staff. This marketing cheating spoiled every optimism in the end which this hotel gave me. I find it very hard to write any negative review against any hotel. I wanted to give 5 ratings but due to this marketing trap, I had to reduce it to Average.

The free wi-fi was also easy to connect to and fast. They have a program that offers free refills of either still or sparking water into reusable glass containers in exchange for not requiring fresh linen every day - good move as you really don't need to have all the linen washed every day consuming water and detergent.   The buffet breakfast was okay although with the same offering daily it was a little repetitive by day 4.  The proximity to local food outlets is great - try the local hawker centers for great Singaporean  dishes.

I was upgraded to their limited New rooms that includes an android phone with FREE unlimited calls to 27 countries !! & free access to nearby fitness center and late checkout too. What more can any business traveller ask? The room was typical Ibis style- very functional and neat with clean sheets and one of the best towels. They have a wide variety at breakfast- unlike the Ibis generally in Europe.
I had the opportunity to meet their General Manager- Pierre Etienne de Montgrand, a father of 4 whose looks belie his age. And is the driving force here. I could see a perceptible enhancement in the response and communication by staff with guests. They are cheerful and welcome warmly. This is one of the reasons why a hotel draws back customers. Pierre and his team have also undertaken a corporate social responsibility that recycles waste while providing livelihood to poor in Indonesia !!
I can not fault this property on even a single count and will strongly recommend it to travelers. Stop exploring TA further- just go to Ibis on Bencoolen.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Mumbai, India",78 ,30 ,5.0,
Date of stay: June 2014,Christina L,Best Hotel in town,"You can't avoid the fact that these days, everything runs with a good WIFI. Hotel IBIS Bencoolen covers you head to toe in making your stay in Singapore a blast. We stayed 10 nights there, had an upgraded room in the Executive Floor and pampered myself silly with the abundance of using the in room WIFI for 5 devices, a supplementary Smartphone to take along during your stay in Singapore, local calls and abroad (limited countries) included, USB sockets in the wall. This was a dream for every Blogger that travels.
The room was clean, beds were comfy (double pillow, fresh sheets) - although the beds were a little high, so I felt like the ""Princess and the Pea"" at times but gradually got used to it. There's a Flatscreen TV in the room, Waterboiler to make coffee, tea, complimentary tea bags, 2 bottles of water that can be refilled at the bar (free) and the usual mini bar fridge. An iron board helps you keep your clothings pressed during a long stay. But as a frequent traveller, I have stopped using /bringing any kind of clothings that needs to be ironed.
The service is prompt and superb at the reception. They help you in everything. We made use of the early check in and late check out which was great to get settled. There's a 7/11 shop and a Pharmecy next door that helps you get everything you want should you be missing something. The MRT (trains) were just a 10 mins walk away to the Bugis Station, or Taxis are always available at all differant times of the day. You can use their bicycles for free (although I wouldn't really recommend that in a bustling city) or even acquire the EZ-Link Card from the reception. About 100m away, the markets and local food stalls offers everything you'd want to see in an asian country. I found many interesting vintage corners during my stay there. A bakery with cakes, bread (european standards) are found just around the corner. I discovered a tiny shop selling my favourite sandwiches with the local pandan kaya spread! Yummz!
With such a huge choice of foods around the corner, we did not book the breakfast from the hotel (which was rather expensive for my taste)
The only thing that was missing in the hotel was a pool. But even there, the next public swimming pool was just 3.5 km away. I used once the laundry rooms (self service) The washing maschines and dryer should be aired more frequently, to prevent any fungus from spreading. The laundry rooms are even equipt with tablets for your surfing pleasure.

The hotel is a great place to stay in during your stay in Singapore. They give you everything a traveller would wish for, without making it a fuss. I would definately go there again the next visit.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Bayreuth, Germany",45 ,16 ,5.0,

Being silver card holder, the reception gave us a voucher entitling us to have a complimentary drinks from the bar, however, while approaching the bar the staff refused to offer alcohol (brandy), saying it is not included, later after complaining the reception and after 15mts of drama the staff gave a glass with hardly 10ml spirit, not sure which one, due to their attitude I did not touch the drink.

The complimentary welcome drink is been offered by the hotel, but by the actions of the staff I felt as if they are doing some great favor by offering 10ml of liquor to a member

Other than this, the rates are higher, that is with almost all hotels in Singapore. Our rates were not included with B/F, but there are plenty of food places near by.

Tap water is drinkable, as per the hotel, hence, no free water was offered.

Free wifi, coffee/tea maker, iron board were available in the room.

Location was good, except the staff attitude, no other disappointment.

For sure will not return to this property as there are plenty of good hotels near by with better rates and customer service. Being a accor silver member, if the staff behave such rude manner, what more we can say..",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Doha, Qatar",1196 ,268 ,,3.0

A little history on the area, when Raffles came to the island in 1819, a number of Bencoolen Malays came as well and settled in the area where the street was named.

I booked here as I wanted to experience the Accor hospitality in Singapore. This hotel is good for business & budget travelers. The lobby was great, simple but functional. Staff at check-in was efficient, friendly & check-in was fast....all done within 6mins.

I was impressed by the simple exterior & especially the modern bright interior design of the hotel upon my arrival.

The small room was a nicely coordinated bright palate of colors, albeit small, but certainly very functional and clean:

- comfortable bed with a selection of soft and firm pillows but more importantly clean;
- a good work desk, a flat screen inset led tv;
- great designed toilet with shower, toilet, sink & clean;
- nice clean towels;
- free wi-fi access throughout the hotel for multiple devices (but sometimes it get cuts off
intermittently at times);
- laundry (SGD$4 each for wash & drying) and ironing available on Level 2....very useful;
- location is easy access to many places be it for shopping, tourist spots or to the CBD for
business;
- staff very friendly, helpful and always smiling.

Date of stay: June 2014,ThinController,Another great stay,"I stayed again for 3 nights at the Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen; this time twin sharing a room with a work colleague on the 16th floor. Compared with my previous 2010 stay at this hotel, I noted that there was an ironing board and iron in our room and the small fridge also worked well. Our booking included breakfast. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the airconditioning efficient (after a few hours), so both my colleague and myself slept well. The room included USB ports on the bedhead for charging, which helps when there are two people in the room. The shower included a single shampoo/shower gel dispenser, although one cake of soap was also provided each day.

The room was on the opposite (i.e. south east facing) side of the hotel to my previous stay and, being on the 16th floor, we had a good view from our room.

First, some great positives:
* As many reviewers have noted the location of this Ibis is fabulous. It is a very short, level walk to Bugis Junction and there are two hawkers food markets within 100 metres of the hotel for travellers who wish to experience inexpensive lunches and dinners,
* The selection of hot breakfast items was again excellent,
* The free wi-fi in the rooms seemed to be relatively fast, and
* Check in and check out was fast and efficient.

A few minor quibbles for travellers to note:
* No hand towels were provided in the bathroom,
* The luggage storage is quite limited for two suitcases - fortunately the beds have clear space under them and I ended putting my travel pack under my bed so we could more around the room without tripping over our luggage,
* The housekeeping staff put (and kept returning) the room bin to a very narrow slot between the clothes hanging doorless ""closet"" and the ""bookcase"" where the kettle is. We moved the bin to the other side of ""closet"" so our shirts would not be splashed by tea bags being put in the bin, but housekeeping kept putting it back,
* While free tea and coffee is provided the supplies were somewhat miserly - only two coffee sachets and two tea bags each day. Luckily one of us drank tea and the other coffee,
* The four lifts still serve every floor so sometimes there can be quite a wait for a lift. This could be easily be addressed by making at least one lift an ""express"" lift to service floors 10 and above, and
* The hotel had run out of the EZ link cards which are advertised on the website as being included in the room, so we had to purchase these at Bugis MRT station.

At about $200AUD (including breakfast for 2 people) we thought the Ibis Bencoolen is excellent value and I would be very happy to stay here again.

Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen benefits from its location. Less than 10 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station, less than 5 minutes walk to Bugis Street and the shopping malls Bugis Junction/Bugis Plus, 10 minutes walk to Haji Lane, 7-11 literally next door, Albert Centre Market and Food Centre just 5 minutes walk for a fulfilling hawker-style meal for less than USD 5.

The room is economical in space and amenities, just as expected from an Ibis hotel. The standard room has just enough space for 2 luggage (we brought 1 size-32 luggage and 1 size-24 luggage). The double bed is spacious enough for regular-sized Asians, but will be too short for anyone over 180cm. Mattress, pillow and duvet are comfortable. We slept just fine.

LCD TV available in room with quite a lot of local and international channel. More than enough if you spend most of your time outside. We barely watched the television while we were there.

AC is cool and temperature can be adjusted just fine. Small bathroom with shower box, toilet and sink. Towels (bath towels and hand towels) and soap (multi-function liquid soap/shampoo) replaced daily. No toothbrush or toothpaste, but no matter, I always bring my own shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste anyway. No room slippers, but since I've read about this in some Tripadvisor reviews, I came prepared with my own room slippers. Hair-dryer available in the bathroom. Plenty of toilet paper.

Iron and ironing board provided in room. Electric kettle with tea bags, instant coffee packs and sugar packs available for free. No bottle water provided but tap water is drinkable.

No cupboard to store clothes but there is a small, open cupboard with several hangers to hang some of our clothes.

Check in and check out was quick. There are PCs and iPads (free) at the lobby. Wifi is available for free anywhere in the hotel including in rooms. The connection was fast and we happily used the wifi in our room.

Front desk and cleaning service staff were friendly and capable.

When we stayed the published rate was SGD 201, but we got a deal from Ibis website for approx. SGD 150 per night. No breakfast for our package but we'd rather find food outside at hawker centers, cheaper and tastier.

Price-wise is value for money, considering the facilities we get and the fact that it's Singapore. Our standard room had windows overlooking Bencoolen St., AC works fine, bed and bedding comfortable, hot water available and water for shower was strong, room is clean and the parquet flooring gives the room a warm ambience. A lot of hotels with the same price do not provide the same level of quality and some are located further away from the MRT station or the city center.

We got to the hotel by MRT from the airport, and it took us 50 minutes on a Thursday afternoon (around 1.30 pm) from the airport MRT station to the hotel. Taxis are easy to get at the hotel lobby and on a Sunday noon it took us about 20 minutes (at about SGD 20-25, forgot the exact fare) to the airport.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Tangerang, Indonesia",66 ,24 ,,4.0

Arrival was very smooth, room was available around noon already. Swift transfer to room on 16th Floor, very quiet setting. The room is quite small but was OK for the two of us.

Clean feel through the wooden floor. AC OK. Don't bring too much stuff, storage space is extremely limited.

Loved the little bench in the corner, ideal to surf the net (free of charge, good speed) or watch TV (OK choice of channels; more movies would have been great).

Very nice bathroom, not big by any standards. Excellent shower with good and consistent water temperature and pressure. Wish some ***** Hotels had such showers.

What amazed me was the breakfast; very good choice and the hours are incredible (4am to 6am coffee and breads, 6am to 10am full show, 10am to noon coffee and breads). Truly a role model!

Also had lunch and dinner at Taste a couple of times and though the menu is not that extensive, the quality and taste of the food is great. One of the best ""coffee shops"" I have seen at any hotel.

Location, a great plus too.

Really not much I can find to improve. One little thing, I do understand that it is difficult to find the right talent to clean rooms but in a place like Singapore and a hotel with international travelers it would be good if the room attendant would understand the most basic of English expressions.

The hotel is within walking distance to a lot of attractions and allows you to hit up most of the places you would want to see in Singapore-- Bugis junction for shopping and food, Hawker center, and little india.
The room was a good size for 2 people and the staff was very helpful and kept the facilities clean. I would definitely stay here again!

The room is on the smallish size... but sizable compare to some of the hotel I stayed in Paris or Tokyo.

The facilities though is minimum, no gym, no swimming pool. There is a restaurant/bar on premise that offers Breakfast/Set Dinner and Happy Hour.

Breakfast was self-serve and was quite fine with a very good selection. It was just what we needed after having traveled for 22 hours. The hotel location seemed to be in a nice area of Singapore from what I saw. I was told that there was an ATM not far from the hotel. We had a private guide pick us up at the airport and on the next morning so didn't have a chance to explore the area around the hotel. It seemed to be about a 20 minute drive from the airport.

Yes, the rooms are small but they are cleverly designed, making the most of the space. We didn't feel at all claustrophobic (& I am really susceptible to this even in a number of 5 star hotels I've stayed in) because each room has a large window with a reasonable view (ie, not looking at the wall of a building next door for example). As has been mentioned in other reviews, rooms on one side of the hotel overlook a temple. As also mentioned in other reviews, the beds are firm but very good quality. We found them very comfortable (no partner disturbance!). The concierge staff are extremely friendly & helpful & the wifi is fast & free. There are also computer & ipad terminals in the hotel foyer. There is a taxi rank at the hotel, very important & handy in Singapore. Buses & MRT stations are very close. The Ibis seems to have regular deals including breakfast. We paid $150 (Australian) for our room which included breakfast. We were meeting up with our adult son & asked for 2 inter-connecting rooms which was fantastic, a great option for families. You can request interconnecting rooms, but not guarantee them. So we basically got 2 rooms with breakfast for us all (which is excellent by the way) for $300 (Aus) per night.

Btw, a new mrt line just opened when we got there last Dec. 22 called Downtown line, color blue. Were able to tried this free ride going straight to Chinatown (5 stations away from Bugis around 15 mins) and Bayfront is just 2 stations away. A Chinese Buddhist temple, an Indian Hindu temple, a Jewish synagogue and a Catholic church all near the hotel. The place must be very well blessed.

The bus station directly in front of the lobby had buses direct to Orchard Road or City Hall making it very convenient for me to travel around. Unlike previous reviewer, I found that the staffs were very helpful and friendly.  The hotel might be a bit busy at times but I was attended to fairly quickly when I first checked in. The room was middle sized, and was thoughtfully equipped with sockets on the bedside table as well as an USB port for charging your mobile device. WiFi was provided free of charge and was fast.

Date of stay: December 2013,FitDude,Close to perfect for Budget Hotel,"With only one minor problem which was eventually resolved satisfactorily, this hotel is strongly recommended.  First, with respect to location and transport, this hotel is located just outside of the main tourist area of Orchard Rd., which is only a short subway train or bus ride away. The MRT Bugis train/subway station is only a 5 minute walk away, and the bus stop is directly outside the hotel’s front door.  Next, the area surrounding the hotel is packed with lots of eating places and shopping.  Albert Centre is a large fast food court located behind the hotel, and the Bugis Junction Shopping Center is a short walk, which has plenty of mid to high end mall shops and food of all types and price ranges. The Bugis Street Market has a good variety of bargain shopping directly across Victoria Street from Bugis Junction.  A 7-11 is also located immediately adjacent to the hotel which is open 24 hours, as is the hotel’s restaurant. Although I reserved a double bed room, I was given a twin single bed at check-in and this problem was not resolved (by Front Desk Employee Melvin) until my third night.  The room itself was adequately sized for no more than 2 persons, with a decent sized work desk, mini-fridge, tea and coffee service and a safe.  The air-conditioning was cold and quiet, and the bathroom had a very modern design walk-in shower with good pressure, although hot water takes a while to arrive.  The bed was quite comfortable as were the pillows.  The television is very small with only a limited channel selection. The room was well lighted with lots of multi-country electrical outlets and a bedside USB mobile phone charging outlet. The maid service was exceptional as my room was cleaned promptly upon my departure each morning.  Free in room Wi-fi internet worked well, and there are also computer and tablet terminals for guest use in the lobby, but like all other Ibis hotels, there is no gym.

It was a last min booking from our awful experience in the previous hotel. Anyway we call them up in the first place to ask about the room, they told us there were rooms available for our request and told us to book online as this was cheaper! Very honest of them!

The location is super.... you couldn't ask for any better. It is about 5 mins walk to Bugis MRT. But there is sooo much around the hotel....from local food stalls, to shopping malls. Did I mentions LOTS of shopping?!? Bugis have one of the most shopping outlets in Singapore.

Another good thing about the hotel is the staff - they provided excellent service. They were super friendly and really helpful.

The buffet breakfast was really nice. There were so many options from western to asian cuisine that you won't be bored.

For those vegetarian out there, you don't need to worry. The buffet breakfast have lots of option for you. If not there are so many vegetarian restaurant out there!! (Fortune centre have lots of vegetarian food outlets!! which is just beside the hotel)

My only downside to the hotel was:
They were planning to give us a connecting room, but the previous person have requested for longer stay. So we couldn't have the connecting room at the time we check in. They ask if we would like to wait longer, but we thought since the other room was only 2 rooms down the corridor, we thought it was fine. Other than that nothing bad about the hotel.

The cleanliness was impressive. A lot of other, better ranked, hotels should take a lesson here. The room was basic but well appointed. I had a splendid view on Mount Emily from one of the top floors. The breakfast was consiberably well and ranged from sushi to Chinese dumplings to Continental BF. There could have been a bit more of fresh fruit though. The location is excellent to get around by taxi, MRT, bus, or even by foot. Little India is not that far and you can even reach Plaza Singapura and Orchard easily by foot. Some smaller things I would like to add which could be improved though:
Although I am aware of the fact that IBIS is a ""no thrills"" hotel, you really should improve the quality of your TV-sets. Also, the water pressure on the top floor was not that impressive. Last but not least I was a bit irritated about the smallish size of the room safe. I could not even lock my 13'' notebook away due to the limited space.

The rooms were clean and pleasant though a little on the small side. The hotel doesnt have a pool. There is no room service, at one point I wanted a fork and had to go down the restaurant to get one, they said there was no one to deliver to the room.

Take the shuttle to get to the hotel from the airport at the Ground Transport Desk for $9. Getting back to the airport cab costs $16-17.

Date of stay: October 2013,Marcus Lim,Great staff and location,"This is a good comfortable hotel with friendly staff who will go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. My family and I arrived early at the hotel about 11.30am to be greeted by a Mr. Wai. We wanted a room on the 16th floor but since there were no rooms available yet on that floor, he offered to allocate a room on the 14th floor instead. Reluctantly we agreed. As we waited for the room to be cleaned, he came and informed us that a guest had just vacated a room on the 16th and offered the room to us. It was simple gestures such as this that we appreciated and which makes us return to this hotel whenever we are in Singapore.

The room was clean and bright with all the basic amenities you would expect to find in a hotel of this standard. What we have to truly highlight is the bed and the pillows which were so comfortable and inviting. This really helped us to get a good night's sleep after a whole day of running around. We truly missed the bed, seriously!

The breakfast was very good with local and western food available. My wife really looked forward to the bacon slices every morning as well as the porridge which was just heavenly. I would like to suggest however that the hotel consider extending the breakfast time to 10.30am everyday instead of 10am for the benefit of guests who may sleep in a little late sometimes, given the comfortable bed and all!

Location is great with the Bugis MRT and Little India MRT stations just a short walk away. There is also a bus stop right in front of the hotel which is very convenient if you do not wish to walk to the MRT stations. Free WiFi is provided in the lobby and the guest rooms so staying connected to your loved ones is a breeze. For those who drive, there is a multi storey car park within the hotel with complimentary parking for guests.

We really enjoyed our stay in Ibis Bencoolen and this is down to the friendly staff from the front desk all the way to the housekeeping personnel. All the staff that we met had a ready smile and greeted us warmly. We look forward to our next visit.",Trip type: Travelled with family,Malaysia,49 ,87 ,4.0,

Date of stay: October 2013,Peter G,"Ibis on Bencoolen, Singapore","The Ibis is very well situaued in Bugis, which has modern malls, a street market and plenty of eating places from all corners of the globe, not to mention the six floors of gadgets in Sim Lim Square just 200m away! The city area and bay are within walking distance (1/2 hour) or a short taxi ride away.

The hotel is always clean and tidy and is good value for money. The rooms are all to a common standard and, whilst quite basic and a bit small, they have everything you need for a good night's sleep, i.e. comfortable bed, en-suite, air-con, tea & coffee and a fridge. There is a maid service every day including change of towels and, best of all, all the showers work really well (I've stayed here many times)!

The staff are always helpful and friendly and the bar & restaurant are convenient if you're too tired to go futher afield (also a very comprehensive breakfast).

I would definitely recommend the Ibis on Bencoolen for business travellers or holiday makers wanting a solid base to set out from each day. If you want to stay in all day and use more facilities like swimming pool, gym or sauna then you need to look elsewhere (and probably spend much more!).

Quick tips on comms:
There is free WiFi in the rooms but I found it a bit slow and couldn't be bothered with the continual signing on so I bought a Mobile Broadband unit (MiFi) at Sim Lim Square and a prepaid mobile broadband SIM card at the Singtel shop in Bugis Junction (need your passport for this) and now have internet coverage wherever I go, works really well!
For cheap calls home, buy a prepaid Singtel phone SIM at the 7-11 next door (passport again) put it in your phone and dial 019 before your country code (missing out the two leading zeros, e.g. 01944 for UK) and the call costs next to nothing, deep joy!!",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Durham, United Kingdom",1 ,3 ,5.0,

Date of stay: October 2013,Bernadette_Ruiz,One of the decent hotels in SG with good value.,"We had to check in early at our hotel then leave right away to catch up our WTS coach going to Legoland by 11am. WE arrived at Changi around 930am. We took a taxi going to Ibis Bencoolen. We decided to stay there (over V Hotel Lavender) since it’s near Bugis (a tourist spot for cheap souvenirs and Korean fashion). Though Lavender Station is just right across V Hotel Lavender, MRT is also a few walks away from Ibis via Bugis Station. Tripadvisor’s recommendation was also a factor in booking this hotel. It’s an approximately 20-minute travel from Changi Airport, which costs us around 20SGD.

I would give Ibis Bencoolen plus points. Prior to our arrival, I sent several requests via email for our room, i.e., should be located on a higher floor (they have 16 floors), non-smoking, away from the elevator, and facing the street with temples. Our room was arranged according to my requests except for the view, which, I didn’t actually mind as we just opened the curtains once in the morning to see the weather and that was it.

Check in was a breeze. We arrived at around 1030am and were told that our room was already available. Processing time for check in only took a maximum of 5 minutes. Ibis also has a SOP of addressing any of your concerns at a maximum time of 15 minutes.

Aesthetic wise, Ibis is smaller than V Hotel but more modern and cleaner. It’s similar to Marrison Hotel except for the quality of service. The hotel has no pool (but who’s staying there to swim?). Inside, there’s a flat screen TV, safety box, a refrigerator and closet with hangers. The room has side tables and a mini sofa integrated on the wall. There is also a table and chair facing the window. The bathroom is also small but complete with amenities: hot and cold shower, toiletries, towels, mirror, etc.

The included breakfast was also way better than V Hotel Lavender. It’s a buffet style with wide variety of dishes like cereals, bread, dimsum, rice, viands, and waffles, etc.

Most importantly, upon checking out, Ibis would ask feedback from its guests via email. It only shows how much it values guests’ comments to improve the quality of the hotel and services.

The not so good things I noticed about Ibis though: First. It has the same menu for breakfast for the 2 days we stayed there. The probability of repeated left overs is high, right? Second. No bell boy to assist us with our bags going up our room. Though they have staff to assist you in the lobby, they would only assist you up to the elevator.

Date of stay: October 2013,RoyTA,Fulfill your basic needs,"Stayed there for three nights and there's nothing really to make my stay pleasant or disappointing. We all know what to expect at these room rates from this city. In between hostels and better hotels, I think it's fair to say that Ibis Bencoolen is a safe bet, an all-rounder.

Check-in on a Sunday afternoon was reasonably fast. I expected there would be queues given the sheer number of rooms but there were only one to two persons waiting in each line. The elevators (a total of four) could get congested at times but only at times, and waiting time was acceptable.

A lot has been said about their rooms and there is not much more I could add to, though unlike many others I found the softness of the bed just right for me. And the shower stall was truly tiny, but I'm waiting to be told there are tinier elsewhere.

The only brightspot I found about the hotel was actually the coins operated laundry machines on the third floor. There was a row of machines in the room and four of them (nearer to the door) were for washing and the other four for drying. It took 4 one-dollar coins to operate either the washing or drying machine, and (at least up the time of my stay) the coins had to be the ""older"" ones which are entirely bronze. The dollar coins in the latest issue which are in bi-metallic composition and slightly larger size wouldn't fit into the slot. So it would take 8 one-dollar coins for washing and drying. Each procedure took 40 minutes. You could just time the process, leave the machine running and return at a later time. For 8 local dollars you could wash and dry a machine of clothes and that's super value in Singapore in my opinion.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Hong Kong, China",36 ,7 ,3.0,

Date of stay: October 2013,PoliPerth,Great stay in a Single Accessible Room,"When I booked the hotel online months ago, directly on the hotel website, the best option for a single person was a Single Accessible Room, including breakfast, and I am so glad I did.  I arrived at the hotel at 4.30am, and was able to check-in straight away, which was good, and very much appreciated. The room is really for a person with a disability, although I didn't realise that at the time I booked it, but it is a much better option for the simple reason there is SPACE, LOTS OF SPACE!!!  Especially in the bathroom, no feeling of being shut in a small glass box as there aren't any sliding shower doors, just a wide curtain (not that I needed it for privacy, but still used it just to stop water going everywhere).  Fantastic water pressure in the shower, and it was very nice being able to sit down in the shower on the little fold-down bench seat after a day's walking. The entry door is wide, for wheelchair access, and opens straight into the bathroom.  The bedroom is in another room, and I can call it another room because there is a sliding door to separate the bathroom from the bedroom.  The single bed is actually the size of a single and a half bed.  Snow white bedding, with lovely fluffy pillows, 2 to choose from, 1 softer than the other, but neither hard.  The bed is the comfiest I have ever slept on!  Firm mattress, with 2 softeners under the sheet.  Great air conditioning, which can be turned down at night if it's too noisy.The hotel is in a brilliant location, only a 10 minute walk to the MRT, through the Bugis market, and plenty of buses directly outside the front of the hotel on Bencoolen Street, going to most places of interest to tourists.  Plenty of taxis available at any time, and all cheap.  A 7-11 is next door, also a pharmacy (but not for prescriptions).  Plenty of food options everywhere! Little India is only a 10 minute walk away too, via a shortcut.The nicest thing about the hotel is the staff.  Without exception, they are incredibly helpful, and always smiling :-)  Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them, and they are all very knowledgeable.  I had a little problem, in that some medication went missing, and the Duty Manager Simon and his assistant personally undertook to accompany me to the pharmacy, and the hotel actually paid for the replacement for me, which was such an amazing gesture.

The hotel is within walking distance of bugis metro station which links directly to the airport and is within walking distance of orchard road, Clarke quay and the Grand Prix circuit itself.

I was really impressed by this as some places are very strict with check in times. Our room was nice, it was small but you don't really come to Singapore to stay in your room, you want to explore! My only complaint is that the bed was very hard and uncomfortable but luckily I was so exhausted from exploring that I was able to sleep although I was left with a very sore back each morning! Our room was opposite the lift which meant we were often woken by people waiting for the lift. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we were given a lovely bottle of wine as a gift. Housekeeping did a fantastic job with cleaning the room, and the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. We wanted to go to Sentosa and they explained where to get the free bus and ensured we had the appropriate paperwork, this was handy as we saw people who were staying at a different hotel not allowed on the bus back from Sentosa because they didn't have the right paperwork.

We got a room on floor 16 and although it took a while sometimes for the lift to come, we were happy that we got no street noise (if this happens on lower floors). The twin room was small with not much space for our bags and only one tiny closet with no door. There was a safe and small fridge which was adequate for our needs - two adults. As we didn't spend much time in the room, only to sleep, this wasn't an issue.  The breakfast was fine with the normal western hot breakfast and of course asian fare. The tiny muffins are really yummy and fresh fruit was great.  The Taste restaurant had a special type of meal where you good literally taste a number of dishes for a price. The duck was especially good.  The hotel is close to Bugis Junction and Market, not far from the MRT and buses outside for Chinatown, Clarke Quay etc. Fantastic base for shopping and sightseeing.

This place is so central, with easy access to Bugis MRT, taxi, Sim Lim Sq, Burlington, Orchard Rd is an easy walk away.

Rooms are small, (very clean, simple layout). This factor pushes back on the value score,

Date of stay: July 2013,NX622,Good hotel in a good location.,"I had two nights at the Ibis Bencoolen in late June. The hotel is approximately 20 mins from Changi airport by taxi and will cost around $27 SGD. Don’t be alarmed if the taxi starts heading down backstreets as the access to the hotel is not off the main road out front of the hotel (Bencoolen St).

Check in was fairly quick and I won a spot prize which turned out to be a small ipad looking thing for 24 hours. It took longer to sort out signing up for it than the actual check in process and to be honest it wasn’t that great when I got it going. There are a couple of computers in the foyer with free internet access which were very good.

The room was typical of the Ibis chain being clean, simple, functional and medium in size. I was on one of the higher floors and never heard a thing all night. Breakfast was very good with a selection of about four different cereals, cooked food including scrambled eggs, sausages, baked beans etc and pastries.

Although not sitting on top of one of the MRT (subway) lines, it is located close to nearby attractions including Buis St for cheap t-shirts and souvenirs (located one block behind the hotel), Sim Lim Square for reasonably priced electronics or Little India for Mustafas 24 hour department store and local (indian) restaurants. The nearest MRT station would be Bugis St. There is a bus stop outside the hotel which will connect you to all the main attractions including Orchard Rd (less than 10 minutes), the waterfront with the Merlion or Chinatown (10 mins). There are 7-Eleven convenience stores located out the front door to the left and right less than a minute away.

The easiest way to get around Singapore is via a swipe card system which can be used on any bus or train very cheaply. They can be purchased at the station and topped up at a number of other places including convenience stores etc.

Singapore is not a cheap place to stay. The Ibis Bencoolen is a relatively inexpensive place to stay in a good area with access to just about anywhere you want to get to. Definitely recommended.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Sydney, Australia",92 ,146 ,4.0,

We were familiar with the Accor brand, having stayed in All Seasons in Bangkok a few times, so we knew what we were in for. The rate was for room only, but breakfast is affordable so one can simply charge it to the room. The room, although small compared to some business hotels I have stayed in before; was comfortable and clean. Kudos to the Housekeeping team for taking such efforts maintaining its cleaning standards. Amenties are basic and minimal, e.g. where other hotels may have face, hand and bath towels, Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen only has bath towels. To me, that was all I need. The great news is that in-room internet is complimentary. A rarity indeed. Again, do not be too quick to judge. Once again, look at the price you are paying. There is only one food and beverage outlet, Taste Restaurant. It is cosy and serves wonderful tapas-style local dishes, excellent for tourists wanting a taste of our local cuisine in small bites. Breakfast was the usual spread of local and international dishes. Highly recommended. It is a pity it was lacking a full dinner crowd.
In summary, do not expect too much, but if you are looking for affordable accomodation and an alternative to hotels that charge way too high a price for its services and facilities, Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen is the

On the plus side: - we got a great price for two nights over a weekend - although it's not really centrally located to anything much, it is only about a 5-minute walk to Bugis MRT and the Bugis shopping centre. - the room was spotlessly clean - we were fortunate to be able to check-in early - the car park is good and free to guests - we weren't troubled by noise from other rooms even though the hotel was very busy. - the staff members we came into contact with were polite and very efficient.

It is centrally located on good bus routes and an easy stroll to Bugis MRT station.While not a luxury hotel it has all that a traveller to Singapore might need, with possible exception of a pool.  The rooms are clean and functional, not huge in size but after all you only need somewhere to sleep. The staff are friendly and willing to help.  We were going to change some money on one morning and the man at the desk suggested we use a money changer in Bugis Markets as the rates would be better than those at the hotel, not often you get that!There is a 7-11 downstairs selling drinks etc, the rooms have a small fridge but thankfully it's empty so you can stock it yourself.  A much cheaper idea than mini-bar options in most hotels.  The Tastes Restaurant is open 24/7 with reasonable pricing on a wide range of foods, although you have so many options on the doorstep that we didn't bother with it.  There's a cheap noodle place over the road where we managed on one occasion to grab a meal and drinks for about $12SGD, and that is only one option.So the Ibis is worth a look if you are after a reasonably priced central place to call home while in Singapore.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",179 ,76 ,4.0,

The hotel is positioned well. As soon as you get out from the building from behind you immediately get your first culture shock (on the positive way) going into a Chinese market. If you leave the hotel via the front door several bus lines are just there moreover Orchard road is only a few blocks away.
Althought the room is small (comparing to european standards), it is clean and comfortable for a couple, and its cost is really competitive in Singapore. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Our double bedroom contained a huge, comfortable bed but friends next door complained that their twin beds were very narrow.
We realised on the second morning that we had already paid for breakfast when we booked. When we asked for a refund a very acceptable compromise was offered. We could stay in our rooms till 7 pm for a late check out, which suited us perfectly. The hotel puts on transport to the airport but this comes at a cost. We paid $25 from the airport to the hotel but the return journey came to $55 so I advise book your own.

There were no mention of what guests should do, so after waiting for about 5 minutes I popped out of my room to see a few people looking confused about what is going on. Some of us walked to the lift lobby and could see people exiting from the hotel onto the street. We could not see or hear any fire trucks.

Their Taste restaurant on the ground floor will give you an example of street food at twice the price but you know it will be fresh and right.  The service will be good and friendly too.The rooms are what you should expect from an Ibis.   Clean and functional.  They have limited space but the space is used perfectly.  You have a desk, a small but functional TV, an area for hanging clothes and a room safe.  You also have a room minibar with nothing in it.  The cooler, though, works and if you wish to put provisions in there you have access to a 9/11 store right nextdoor.The only glitch during my stay was that once you entered the elevator you had to use your room card to swipe it to take you to your level.  I got in and swiped to no avail.   The door closed.  Then the light went off and I was left in total pitch blackness.Luckily for me I am an avid smoker (though not in elevators) and I immediately accessed my lighter to discover that I was still on the ground floor and had to only depress my doors open key to regain visbility.Their pillows, though I know this is a personal choice, were as good as anywhere I have experienced.

Date of stay: April 2013,Andrea B,Value for Money Hotel Singapore,"Over my visit to Singapore for the past 2 times, I have the opportunity to stay in this hotel.
First of all location. My comment, this is one of the best location to stay in Singapore. Bus and taxi stops in front of the hotel. 20 minutes walk to nearest MRT system. In front of it, you got Burger King for choices. Take 20 meters to the right, there is Sim Lim Square with its own good food court. Beside ibis hotel, Bugis street. And of course the famous Bugis street shops. Where you could find anything for your gift. About 20 minutes to Orchard Road by taxi. Hotel taxi lobby in the back of the hotel, but don't worry, Ibiis Bencoolen is well known in this city.
Second, the hotel itself. The room is very clean. Although small, but it is worth it. After all it is 3 star hotel worldwide chain. It has minimalist style. Wifi is very fast and free for room guest. All seems in order and well managed. I would say this is over my expectation in 3 star hotel. In fact with additional facilities, it should become 4* hotel.
Third, the food. The food is just delicious. I'll say the taste is good. The variants also okay. I wouldn't complain about it.
Fourth, Hospitality. I find the hotel hospitality is good. One time, I did early check in, I am supposed to check in after 12 PM, but since my flight is in the morning, I arrived at around 9 AM. With humble, the receptionist granted me to do early check in. So, I could refresh my self in my room.
Fifth, the price. The reason i choose its because the price is fairly cheap, though not the cheapest, but it is worth to pay with what you get. With these prices, you don't have to worry about your stay in this city. In short, with what you pay, you get more in this hotel.

There was a cafe downstairs in the hotel which had good choice range & nice to eat there after our flight arrived in the evening. Taxi cost $25. Several 7-11 stores in either direction to get water & snacks. Breakast we didn't partake in as it was only a set buffet for $38 with no individual ordering of say toast, eggs & coffee etc which I think they could do well with if they catered for that market but saying that it is hard to find places doing our style brakfast as most places just serve Chineses style breakfast?

A lovely traditional Chinese temple was located directly behind the hotel and the Bugis St markets were here too though the street stalls didn't open as late as they used to? Bugis St MRT a few streets back as were buses to Marina Bay Sands & around town plus numerous new large shopping centres joined by walkovers, restaurants & cinemas (S$9 a movie). We walked to Orchard Rd as we like exercise but it is a cheap taxi ride to or from there & at end of street they are building a new MRT station down the road to be called Bencoolen St - opening 2015 I think?
3 of us caught a taxi to the zoo on Sat morning (less traffic than during the week) - it was S$22 & s$30 for zoo entry. Coming back around 4pm it look an hour in a huge queue to get a taxi & apparently this is a very common wait time.
A taxi to the cruise terminal for Superstar ships was S$12. We like to stay in nice hotels but also like good prices for what we get & this Ibis Hotel was absolutely fine! We did miss having a swimming pool to cool off in after a day of shopping & this hasn't got one but is reflected in the price - no option to use another hotel nearby either even for a fee so if you absolutely need a pool this wouldn't work.This Hotel was in a good location for us & it was an excellent price compared to staying on Orchard Rd & we saved about $500 over the 4 nts stay which we spent shopping instead!",Trip type: Travelled with friends,Gold Coast,15 ,27 ,4.0,

The Good
========
- Service
- Location (Bugis)
- Breakfast Buffet
- Clean

Limiting factors
============
- No frills room (very compact)
- No fitness center
- No pool

Needs Improvement
================
- Elevators (slow to respond - several broken key pads and call buttons)
- Internet - between very slow and no response at all - Must ""log in"" multiple times per day

Date of stay: March 2013,kewlmeister,Highly Recommend It,"Back in Singapore and stayed at the Ibis Bencoolen Singapore (IBS) once again. Stay period 22/03/13 to 24/03/13 and 31/03/13 to 05/04/13

Lost count on the number of times I had stayed with the IBS since my first.
For me the experience is consistent, both the pros and alas the cons.

Location:
Fantastically conveniently located. Bus stop immediately outside its entrance facing Bencoolen Street. Close by to malls, shops, train station, foods. All within 5-10minutes walking distance.
5star

Room:
Though quite small in size (about 28sqm) it’s surprisingly very comfortable and non-claustrophobic. IMPRESSIVELY BRIGHT & CLEAN. Kettle, coffee satchel/tea bags, bar fridge and combination box safe in room. Bed mattress is hard.
4star

Facilities and general
- Free Wi-Fi in room (acceptable speed) and access terminals in lobby
- 24hr lobby restaurant serves breakfast and ala cart menu of local dishes.
Advice: Don’t have breakfast there for more than 2 days during your stay. The spread doesn’t vary much and gets boring. And the presentation/taste is ordinary to poor (eg pastries are dry and unsavory)
- Laundromat and ironing equipments on 3rd floor (do your own laundry and save)
- Signs at lobby with information for guests on bus services and their corresponding popular tourist destinations (very thoughtful and helpful) … see picture with this review
- Sign on room floor promise all guest complaints be resolved to satisfaction within 15 minutes …. see picture with this review.
Note: I had not had the need to put it to a test in all my stays in the IBS.
4star

Front desk:
The reception people are consistently cold, woody and unwelcoming but thankfully efficient. They never seem to improve (on guest engagement) and could easily be replaced with self check-in machines. They contribute little to the satisfaction of all my stays.
3star

Housekeeping:
Every encounter I had with a housekeeping staff in all my stays has been DELIGHTFUL. They are all engaging, happy, smiling, polite, helpful and very good at their job in keeping the room spick-and-span clean. I often wonder why IBS management hasn’t put them at the front desk instead.
Advice: When in the room do ensure the security latch is engaged. Twice during my stay this time the housekeeping staff (a young lady) had opened the door and walked into the room without first knocking. Had I not been decently dressed it would have been really embarrassing … for her. I think she’s just inexperienced and not properly trained.
5star

Overall experience
Extremely good value for money (for hotels short Singapore), comfortable and very good location.
MUST STAY if your budget is SGD$150-$200

i'm a regular customer whose loved stay at this hotel ( Ibis Bencoolen) before,this is my fourth time stayed. So i decide to join as a accor advantage plus,and i made reservation 2 rooms by accor website and i booked since 2 months earlier. But when i do check in,the receptionist couldn't find my name or my husband name and they asked me the confirmation number,and after that can find my name after takes me so long process and the girls whose doing check in me its not friendly

At that time I do check in at 2.30pm, i made reservation for 2 rooms include breakfast +wiifi ,one room is ready but second room still not ready and have to wait again for my second room

So i'm thinking now what a function for join member as accor advantage plus if all if this things happened to me,

from the price its same between member and not member,from fast check in between member and not member its same,the big size of room its same also,the difference things that i become a member is i just got voucher 3 nights stay one days free,voucher birthday cake and voucher discount for dinner with min purchase.
beside of that i paid to become a member accor as IDR.2.200.000/ year which is

Date of stay: April 2012,siddy_bolly,A business traveller in my own country,"A fabulous location for a business traveller on a tight company budget. That sums up my short business trip at the Ibis Bencoolen Singapore early 2012.

There was much left to be desired with the Ibis hotel entrance. My taxi drove past Bencoolen Main Street and turned into the back alley, passed some big rubbish bins and turned into another inconspicuous lane, voila, we were deposited into Ibis Bencoolen's entrance, which was essentially the back door of its neighbouring buildings. Not sure if this received the nod from the feng shui master...

Kudos to Ibis for striving to make up for the lack of ceremony at the entrance to make the lobby trendy with injections of chirpy colours and iconic modern furniture and accessories. My room was more monochromatic, compact (one would be hard pressed to swing a cat in here), functional and most importantly, clean. It had all the mod cons a business traveller would need. Do note there's only shower stalls in the bathroom, which wasn't an issue. Though having travelled 14 hours, thoroughly jet-lagged & straight into work, I could use with a hot bath to soothe my sore & aching muscles.

My room came with breakfast, which had a good selection of Western and local dishes (hooray for homesick me!). The front of house staff service was average, it took my colleague and me a while to check out due to some confusion with the online booking. I'm pleased to say the service staff was better.

This hotel was non-existent when I moved out of Singapore in 2005 to read my post-graduate in London. I recommend it for its highly central location, walkable to many tourist attractions like Little India, Singapore Art Museum, CHIJMES, Raffles Hotel etc and MRT stations. And for long-haul travellers, I recommend the reasonably-priced reflexology service next door with late opening hours, manned by friendly local Singaporean ""uncles"" (read: middle-aged men).

It just feels different from the usual American or English chains. I've only stayed at one other Ibis in Myeongdong, Seoul some years back and but that was enough to drop any apprehension in making a similar booking in Singapore. Mind you, this is no 5 nor 4-star pretender. It is a business/tourist-class establishment done well, offers good value for money (though not cheap since this is Singapore during the Christmas holidays), knows its niche market preferences and still remains contemporarily stylish. Enough has been said about the strategic location. For drivers, the complimentary car parking is a wonderful. The garage is impeccable. Check-in is supremely professional, swift but warm. The Ibis room prototype appears consistent wherever you go. It is cozily compact but not for the claustrophobic. I've seen smaller in Hong Kong & Japan - spatial perception is relative. The interiors of ubiquitous light timber and bright colors can be both reassuring and repetitively boring. For us, it needed to be a clean comfortable place to sleep, unload our shopping and shower. We were not disappointed on all three counts. Breakfast is straight forward, nothing gourmet about it but healthy, filling and fresh. The crowds during peak hours can be a turn-off so try to get there early. Late risers get an abbreviated version at the bar - which was rather thoughtful. Checking out was a breeze.

The Ibis operate a ""15 minute "" time scale on any problems with the room or anything in the hotel and if it is not attended to inside 15 minutes then they give you some kind of compensation.

As with all Ibis hotels, this is a very basic hotel, so do not expect a lot.  The rooms are clean and made up, but quite small, and there is no room service, of course.

Date of stay: February 2013,StevensCreek,Affordable Singapore,"Nice hotel. Good location. Affordable. Stayed there 4 nights and the room was what I expected - functional and not luxurious. The price also reflected that, which was the main reason I picked it.

From the airport, the hotel was well known to the Taxi driver, so that was helpful. Arriving at the airport between around midnight and 5am you'll probably have to take a taxi. The MRT does not operate those hours. Same thing when leaving. If you have an early flight, plan on a taxi. I left the hotel at 3:30am and there were several cabs waiting for customers. That was unexpected and kind of reflects the overall stay (pleasant surprises).

The hotel had what I needed (quiet room, great water pressure, mini refrigerator, decent view out 13th floor window and a 7-Eleven right next door). I've seen comments on the slowness of the elevators and that was true during my stay too. The checkin/checkout process was smooth and there was no language barrier (English).

If you do stay here, you can walk to the Hop On/Off bus starting point (Suntec), Marina Bay Sands, Orchard Road, Clarke Quay and Singapore River but you'll want to enjoy walking. Otherwise, take a taxi or the MRT. Bugis is the station I used and it was 5-10mins away. No problem getting there.

Arrival Experience

I arrived via taxi from the airport and proceeded to check-in. I found the reception area to be quite clean and new. The reception staff members were just ok, not quite as warm as can be found in the higher-end hotels in Singapore and that’s usually the case for budget hotels in Singapore.

The Room

I found the room to be very clean and functionally designed which is as expected in the budget hotels in Singapore, although on the whole it was slightly better than the other budget hotels I’ve tried there. The quality of the wooden flooring was very good and there was also a safe and fridge included within the room. The shower was also large compared to those in other budget hotels but the bathroom itself was still quite small. However, the design know-how evident in the bathroom appeared better than what I’d seen at the Aqueen Lavender and Value Hotel Thomson, as the shower cabinet did not allow water to escape to other parts of the bathroom floor, for example. In terms of function, the shower pressure was very good and the water was immediately hot. However, the shower stall still used the same 3-in-1 body wash, shampoo and conditioner which is often found in the budget hotels so it was clear that this was not a fully mid-range hotel.

The main room area was overall quite small compared to usual hotel rooms but larger than in typical budget hotels there, some of which are really small and have no real room to move within. It may be that the high ceilings contributed towards the feeling of space but in itself, the room would definitely have been larger than other budget hotels in Singapore in terms of total room area. Everything in the main room was very functional although simple. The colour-design was done quite well. It was good that wooden flooring was used and no carpet as the room looked easily maintainable and it was not too surprising to find that it was very clean.

The beds were quite hard but they were still comfortable and also clean. The air-con was very powerful. Lighting was more than adequate and the room was certainly designed to be very bright when all the lights were switched on and did not have a dark or sombre character at all.

Internet was provided and I found it to be reliable and fast with no complaints about the wireless service. The LCD TV was also provided as were other usual amenities including tea and coffee-making facilities with a clean kettle provided, which was quite good for a budget hotel.

The view from the room was quite alright, looking out over the nearby Bugis area with its shopping malls and buildings. The work-desk was directly located next to the window so afforded a good view of the immediate surroundings, which would be quite nice for anyone working there.

Main issues with the room included the soundproofing, which was not the best as it was possible to hear the sounds from the corridor in particular. There really aren’t any budget hotels that I’ve experienced in Singapore with excellent room sound-proofing. Also, the room was a connecting room even though I specifically requested a non-connecting one, as they didn’t have one available. Also, I had booked a Queen-bed room, which went through without any issues but upon arrival at the hotel, it turned out that the queen bed was only available for one of the two nights that I'd booked. I didn't feel that the booking for the Queen bed should have gone through in that case.

There is a video of the hotel room available if you follow the link within my profile section.


Public Areas

There weren’t many public facilities in the hotel, no gym or pool and I didn’t manage to try the bar or the restaurant. However, there were coin-operated laundry machines on the 3rd level and vending machines on every level, where the prices were quite reasonable and certainly better than found for the same items at the 7-11 next door.

The hotel is located in the Bencoolen area so there were plenty of eateries and shops reasonably closeby, although not many of them were open at the time of my arrival, which was close to midnight. The hotel’s location is central and near Orchard Road with the nearest MRT station being Dhoby Ghaut to my knowledge.

There was just one café open nearby at midnight, which was more in the style of a hawker stall and that appeared to set a theme, as the Value Hotel Thomson was also located near a few hawker stalls which remained open till late at night so it seems that the budget hotels have given some thought to their location near these late-night conveniences.

Although the 7-11 nearby wasn’t good value for drinks with the vending machines within the hotel corridors offering better value, the 7-11 would be a good place to buy late-night snacks and hot drinks.


Staff Service

The reception staff member was just ok upon arrival, as in all budget hotels in Singapore. She did appear to be much friendlier later on in my stay and offered assistance when I was looking through the leaflets and brochures in the tourist area in the lobby so that certainly showed much better service.

Conclusion

The hotel offered good rooms and nice public areas with quite a central location in the Bencoolen area of Singapore. However, the issue was that it didn’t appear to be really a budget hotel in terms of price but was still mainly targeting that market. It was semi-budget in terms of price and unfortunately didn’t really change my impression that the budget hotels in Singapore do not generally offer good value, as paying double their usual prices normally secures a much bigger and better-quality room. Here, the problem was that paying not double but just 50% more would get access to a much larger and bigger room, which was the case as I stayed at the Pan Pacific next and the rates were only about 50% more.

This is the second time I've stayed at Ibis on Bencoolen, and both times I've been very happy with the service. Don't get me wrong, it is undoubtedly a budget hotel (tiny tiny room, tinier bathroom, no breakfast included, no luxuries at all), but it's new, clean and service is efficient with a smile. The hotel is very well located - a short walk from the Bugis shopping centre and MRT. Little India and Orchard Road are walkable too (though I preferred to take the MRT and escape the Singapore heat). Best thing about the hotel - it's next door to a hawker centre!

Date of stay: February 2013,Ian B,"Comfortable, but limited facilities for the price","The Ibis on Bencoonen is a well-located hotel, although my taxi driver had to consult with several colleagues in the taxi-rank at the airport to obtain its location.

The tariff charged is hardly ‘budget’, but it seems ‘par for the course’ in Singapore- although similar in price to the 5 star Sofotel we stayed at in Cairo on the same holiday. The rooms are comfortable, although small and lacking storage. The breakfast is good, although expensive. I don’t think that a glorified snack-bar cafe (One by the Bar) and a ‘restaurant’ (Taste) that only has a 20 item mezze/tappas style menu count as 2 restaurants, but given the location finding suitable eating places outside the hotel is not a problem. The food is very good and reasonably priced, but drinks are expensive (a beer is S$10!!).

There is no room service offered, but the ‘restaurant’ is apparently open 24 hours. There is a laundrette, at a cost of $4 per wash and $4 per dry (so keep those $1 coins!).

I was pleased that our checking in at 6.00am caused no problem, but for S$160 a night I would have expected a porter to assist with the luggage (apparently not offered no matter what time you check in).

The staff were good enough to suggest that I change money elsewhere as the hotel offers a poor exchange rate. I never did locate the place they suggested...

There is a 711 next door to buy beer and snacks, and a Burger King is opposite for the kids. The water in Singapore is drinkable.

You can do your own laundry on one of the floors in the hotel.  7/11 just beside the hotel.  Can walk to Bugis station in about 5 minutes and there is a taxi stand right outside.  My only complaint is that the Taste Restaurant downstairs serves super tiny portions and the people who serve there can be a bit like policemen/women sometimes.

It's rather a 15 mins walk - 3 blocks far which forces you to plan as little back-and-forth as possible from-and-to hotel which is a problem for tourists surely.

I've stayed in Ibis on Bencoolen twice before and in my opinion it's definitely a choice to consider if you want to ensure having a good sleep near city center.

What a fabulous little gem.

Rooms are very compact but had everything we needed and superbly clean, as was the entire hotel.

Wi-Fi is free and quick.

Location is good with bus outside the door, MRT just down the road, 7/11 next door, shopping and markets within a couple hundred metres.

Staff are fabulous and cannot do enough to assist.

Food was good and economical.

There are no porters to carry your cases the 6 metres to the check-in desk, but so what, the cases have wheels, trolleys are available, exactly the same as at the airport. I could not believe an earlier reviewer who complained about this. (It never fails to amaze me the number of people arriving at a hotel in shorts, thongs & t-shirt with hai that looks like it hasn't been washed for days or been combed and expect to be treated like film stars)

Decided to head back to the hotel + watch it on tv.01Jan     Went to Orchard Road today.  We like to shop when we travel + we were disappointed that Singapore doesn’t really have anything that different than what we can buy at home( saved a lot of money this time ). Ate Hainanese chicken rice at the Albert Hawker Center. The portions are small. I guess that’s why they say to buy several dishes to share.02Jan     Took the metro + bus today to the Jurong Bird Park. Got there right at opening, 9 am. Bought the 3 in 1 park hopper ( bird park, zoo + night safari ) for $ 69 SGD.  Lots of pretty birds. We were                Here till almost 2pm.03Jan     Went to Sentosa and Vivo City.04Jan     Metro + bus to Singapore Zoo. Arrived at 10 am + finished by 4 pm. Some animals I haven’t seen before including a porcupine and a komodo dragon ! Lots of dining options here. If you are going to the Night Safari ( doors opens at 5:30 pm, admission at 7 pm ) eat at the Zoo as they have more + less expensive dining options. We were disappointed in the Night Safari as it is dark + difficult to see the animals. Also, not recommended for young children or the elderly. Best to walk all the trails first, then take the tram to see areas not accessible on the trails. We were finished by 10 pm. ( It takes about 90 mins by metro + bus to go to the zoo/night safari. You can take a taxi for approx $ 25 SGD in less time. Because of the distance, best to see both in the same day unless you have young children or the elderly with you who may be too tired to do both ).05Jan     Took the metro to the Harbourfront area and walked to Marina Bay Sands ( lots of luxury shopping here ),  Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Merlion, Clarke Quay ( Clarke Quay is very touristy ). For a better dining option, go to Liang Court mall which is across the street from the end of Clarke Quay. There’s a food court + one of the stalls is the Mini Soup Hot Pot. For only $ 4.50 SGD, you can have a wonderful meal.06Jan     Taxi to the airport was only $ 15 SGD at 7 am in the morning. On the return, we connected in Shanghai. What a rigamarole. Only 4 airlines have a contract to send luggage straight through to your final destination. Air Canada is not one of them. You still have to complete the arrival + departure card. You will pass through China Quarantine Control. A very sophisticated machine will read your body temperature + an alarm will sound if your temperature is even slightly elevated. Then you’ll go into a room to have your temperature taken and all the details of your arrival flight documented. I told them we were just connecting in China, not staying on, so they let us go. I was worried that my DH would be detained till his temperature normalized. Get into the transfer within 72 hours line. Show them your onboard boarding pass. Collect your luggage, go up to the departure level, drop off your bag and go through China immigration + screening again. You will need a minimum connecting time of 2 hours to do all this. It was very scary and both my DH & I agreed that that will be the last time we connect in China. If you connect in Beijing, your luggage can be checked straight through.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"vancouver, canada",5 ,4 ,4.0,

The breakfast buffet was very varied and plentiful, and whilst it was very busy, there never seemed to be a shortage of anything, despite the fact that we arrived towards the end of the breakfast period. The bar staff were superb, and the hotel was running promotions on tiger beer and house wine, which made a few late night drinks very affordable, by Singapore standards.

Date of stay: January 2013,Staidthere,Great value as hotel rates in Singapore rise,"We have stayed at Ibis Bencoolen fifteen or more times since the time of our first review, so we have a very good idea of what the average traveler can expect. On some visits, such as during Christmas shopping season, we have been put off by the great demand on the elevators and sometimes by the rudeness of noisy guests opening their doors so their children can play in the hall. But despite these annoyances, it has been our favorite hotel in Singapore because it provides good value.  We enjoy the location by Bugis Junction and the availability of good restaurants such as Café Leo (and a nearby duirian stand) and Fatty’s, and especially Al-Jilani Indian and Muslim food restaurant which is open 24 hours. Lately, Ibis has been offering buffet breakfasts free or at substantial discounts, and we feel the breakfasts are very good, especially the croissants which I would rate 5 out of 5. The buffet breakfast is served in Taste Coffee Shop which is quite large and has wide window space along the sidewalk on Bencoolen Street, giving a feeling of space, almost as if there is al fresco dining.  Free wi-fi is no longer limited to one device so that we both can feel comfortable using the Internet at the same time. I was impressed at how the staff usually went to extra efforts to be helpful. Someone usually, but not always, welcomed us when we arrived by taxi. And if we stood for a while waiting to be helped at the reception desk, someone almost always offered to help us, although sometimes only the front desk computers had the answer.  The price is the best part.  The sooner you book and pay in advance, the lower the price.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Jakarta, Indonesia",2637 ,1101 ,,5.0

Check in process this time was very fast. I arrived the hotel at around 12 and I got my room already.

Room is small with basic amenities. But for an individual traveller like me, the room is good enough. Would be great if the hotel can provide face towels and tooth brush in room.

Location is good. Short walking distance to the bugis mrt station and shopping malls. A bus stop and a convenience store is just outside the hotel.

Check out is fast also as i prepaid my room. The reception girl was helpful in assisting me with the lugguage and to get a taxi to airport.

Only thing I dislike is the free internet in hotel. It was cut straight once I checked out. I think the hotel should allow guests to use it on the check out day as well.

Overall, I highly recommendate this hotel as you are paying a budget hotel rate but getting a 4/5 stars hotel service.",,"Hong Kong, China",119 ,170 ,5.0,

We weren't expecting much due to the pricing but we were pleasantly surprised. Sure, the rooms were small and very basic but we weren't complaining because we were out most of the time and we just needed a place to sleep/rest. Check-in was a breeze with the hotel staff explaining to us where the nearest MRTs were.

Room was decently clean except for our quilt cover which we only realised was dirty on our 2nd night. We were probably dead tired the first night and didn't notice it. We rang up the front desk to get it changed at around 12am and they sent someone up. Unfortunately, the housekeeping personnel wasn't very friendly but he did change it in the end. However, he asked us to help him change it which was a little silly.

Date of stay: November 2012,Alex Oh,Centrally located and good value,"I stayed at Ibis Bencoolen twice already. It is actually a big hotel for business travellers, as well as, tourists, located in the heart of Singapore Bugis area. As it is a value hotel, the rooms are small, but clean, comfy, secured and all the basics covered, signature of Ibis. All you need for a good night sleep and a hot shower.  They also provide free wifi (and quite fast too, it allows me to watch YouTube in my Ipad with no buffering, and to research places to go). There is a restaurant at the lobby, but I never bothered to check it out, as there is a huge hawker center just behind the hotel, with  a wide range of delicious local food imaginable. Bugis Street, the famous shopping street in Singapore, is also just behind. Although the hotel is not located next to the metro, it is just 10 mins. walk to Bugis station, after some turns through side streets, so important to get the short cut directions from concierge. The area is safe and lively so no problem if you get lost too. Have also the address and the map of the hotel handy with you, as I notice some taxi drivers (during late nights when metro is closed around 11-12 mn) can also get lost or not sure where hotel is.  Checking in though takes time, as normally there is a long line.  A convenience store is also just next door.

A bonus is having Bugis Market close by. Can I suggest OG department store too? Close by and a good selection of good quality goods without the hype of Orchard Road. There's a 7 Eleven close by where you can buy cold beer, if you don't want to pay the price in the hotel bar. Lots of eating options around also, if you are weary and don't want to walk too far.

This time around free internet is available in the rooms. The beds are comfortable and bathroom compact but perfectly adequate for a short stay. TV and kettle in the room as well as a safe and a desk. Not alot of room to have large suitcases on the floor but there is hanging space.

If you're a light sleeper ear plugs are a must. No traffic noise was heard from the 11th floor.

Bathrooms are also smaller but enclosed bath is comfortable.
They even have a vending machine on their floors making the costly minibar a history(kudos for that).I even had a small meal at their coffee shop which was good.
Now the negatives...(nit picking really)

Good location even though it is a bit far from Bugis MRT station (around 10mins walk). But you do walk through a nice neighborhood shopping and eating area. You just need to take the entrance facing the back/the temple and walk towards Bugis.

Good hawker food area offering a varied local dishes at Albert Hawker Centre.

Bugis Street nearby offer great street shopping experience!!!!! make sure you go even just for the experience. Sim Lin opposite the hotel offer electrical & electronic stuff.

Whereas you find a 7-11 on the right, a Guardian pharmacy on the right if you go out of the entrance facing the main road.

Good comfortable room with all you need. No complaint about the room, amenities, and size considering the price one pays for such a new and well designed property in Singapore.

Didn't take the breakfast or any meals in the hotel so can't comment on that. But the restaurant/bar area do look very inviting. Blame that on the Albert Food Court/Hawker Food Centre behind the hotel by the Buddhist Temple!

Summer View Hotel opposite the hotel on the main road is the pick-up/drop-off point for the Resort World Sentosa/Universal Studio free shuttle (20mins journey will bring you to Sentosa Island Resort World Complex). Do prepare passport and immigration white card to show to the driver as the service is only free for overseas visitors. Service commences early as 8:30am and last shuttle back from Sentosa Resort World at 10:30pm at every 30mins intervals.

One improvement that is REALLY NEEDED is the availability of taxi. Many guests are waiting for taxi at the back of the hotel where taxi are supposed to pick up and drop off (or any vehicles) BUT no taxi coming in!!!!!!!!

Twice i have to hail a taxi on the main road even though it is not allowed.

Hotel need a system to inform taxi that its guests is waiting. Maybe a TAXI sign (for taxi driver to see) that show sign that taxi is required by the main road indicating there are guests waiting for taxi at the back (with a press of the button at the reception).

We had buffet breakfast with our stay and it was pretty good. Lots of variety. Easy to walk around and see a lot of Singapore. It's so cheap to use taxi's so if it was too hot walking / exploring jump in the taxi. Most of the drivers knew the hotel location just make sure you know the area or main streets to go off to get to hotel. The main entry is sort of tucked away from the main streets. We didn't dine at the hotel. The staff service was great and check-in & check-out was very smooth & quick.

Date of stay: November 2012,Edward,Front desk...,"It might not be a fair review as I only stayed for one night buy do we have a second chance to gain the first impression?

I would first of all say that I appreciate the staff to clean up the room for us two hours earlier than usual checkin time. We arrived in Singapore at 0730 and called the hotel if it was possible to check in earlier but the staff explained clearly that the hotel was fully booked last night but if we arrived earlier, they would clean up the room in two hours for me and they did it.

What upset me the most are:
1. When I asked for the address of a chicken rice shop nearby, the front desk staff did not know and suggested us to go to the hawker centre, which was not a bad idea and I did it. But what I expected was that she could ask other colleagues and see if they might know. On the second day, I googled it and it just took me 10 minutes walk.
2. When I checked out, guests were just standing at the back as all three front desk counters were occupied, the staff was not aware of who's coming first. Another guest raised the concerns that she was there first but the staff continued to serve the guest cut the line. I personally waited for another 10 minutes and was seeing them serving other guests came later than me.

Date of stay: November 2012,Kevin Yao Lung K,Great hotel for those who insist on an international hotel chain but on a budget,"We stayed at Ibis on Bencoolen for 6 nights and this was our 2nd stay here. It's very conveniently located in Bugis where there's lots of shopping and places to eat.

The rooms are small but for Singaporean standards, they are about average in size. The interior space planning is done up quite well so the only thing that you feel is lacking is a spot for your luggage. Despite the room's small size, there is a good-sized working desk, a small sofa seat, a mini-bar and a small full-height wardrobe. Typical to budget hotels is the all-in-one shampoo/shower gel built-in dispenser but there's nothing cheap about the shampoo/shower gel they give. It smells premium (citrus scent) and it does not leave your hair feeling brittle and dry. In fact, we did not have to use our hair conditioner after using the hotel's shampoo (and that's not something we can say for most other hotels). USB charging points were also provided together with complimentary WIFI (your room number and last name are required to access the WIFI and up to 5 devices can be logged in per room).

Unique to this hotel is a drinks vending machine on each floor (most canned drinks SGD1.30) and a coin-operated laundrette on Level 3 that charges SGD4 per wash and SGD4 per dryer use. We washed all our clothes on our 2nd last day and it helps a lot because the last thing you want to do when you get back home is to wash loads of laundry.

There is a Guardian Pharmacy and a 7-11 on the ground floor. Right behind the hotel is a famous Chinese and Hindu temple. Albert Centre food court is also a stone's throw away from the hotel and that's where you get to eat with the locals. Great local Chinese and Muslim cuisine can be found at Albert Centre. If you want something more upmarket, there's a lot of variety at the Bugis + and Bugis Junction shopping centres located about 300m away from the hotel. Poulet and Ramen Champion on Level 4 of Bugis + are highly recommended for their roast chicken and ramen respectively. Long queues at both restaurants daily.

The front desk staff at Ibis were exceptionally helpful in assisting with directions to local sites.
Bugis MRT station is located underneath Bugis Junction shopping centre and it's a quick 5 minute walk away.

We wanted something basic, well-priced, in town and that included breakfast. The Ibis ticked all these boxes. The rooms are fuss-free but very clean and considering that we were only going to sleep here, ideal for us. We wanted the option of walking around and so decided to not stay at an airport hotel - we are glad we did. Just before going to bed, we ate at a nearby restaurant - Fatty's. Despite the funny name, the food was yummy and fresh. Cost was SGD55 for 3 dishes, rice, mineral water and a large beer. The buffet breakfast the following morning was sufficient - the usual options; not fancy but tasty! All in all, would recommend this hotel if you plan to use your money for more than just hotels. Hotel staff were also lovely - decent bed too :)",,"London, United Kingdom",7 ,12 ,4.0,

Free Sentosa shuttle bus stop directly across the street for foreigners only to take you to Sentosa Island for the casino and Universal Studios Singapore and other attractions. You could even take this bus to Marina Bay Sands as it makes a stop there to pick up passengers. Great buffet breaky with yummy hash browns, hotel style scrambled eggs and real pork bacon every morning (coming from malaysia, this is a treat as hotels only serves beef bacon). On the same row as the hotel there is a 7-eleven and a Guardian (chemist). You really can't ask for more. Oh yes, the hotel is modern and very clean. Staff are super friendly.

Only one observation-- Although this hotel is in a central city business area we are not all in a hurry business people. We were on holiday in Singapore! I felt at times a litttle more could have been done to assist with enquiries as to a tourist nature. For e.g. a little more time could be given than here is a brochure & you can read it for yourself. We would look for your local knowledge. But on the whole staff @ all areas were very good. Rooms were great, beds comfortable, furniture adequate & bay windows great for natural light. Also rooms don't feel small because of clever use of high ceilings. Gives feeling of space. Bathroom is roomy enough & shower is spacious.

Location: The hotel is centrally located in Singapore and the nearest MRT station Bugis is a 10 minute walk away. The 7 Eleven next door was a great help for buying daily necessities. Little India is not far off and therefore is a good attraction for those who love Indian food.

Overall level of service: The service is efficient and with a couple of the front desk people were slightly curt. The doormen were all courteous and eager to help.

Rooms: The rooms are quite small and tight. Especially the bathroom. The bay window in the room is quite nice and helpful.

Nature of Guests: This is best suited for those who are on a business trip. We travelled as a family and we found that sleeping with even 1 child on the bed is a little tight. They do not have an extra bed policy. Obviously there is not much space either.

Date of stay: October 2012,kewlmeister,A very good 3 and half star hotel in Singapore,"Since I first reviewed the Ibis Bencoolen Singapore (IBS) back in Jan 2012 I have stayed there another 3 (or was it 4?) more times. The last being in Oct 2012.
The one thing I cannot fault them on is consistency. The reception check-in experience on each of my 4 stays is consistently umimpressive. Their front desk staffs are unwelcoming, unsmiling and unengaging. They could easily be replaced by check-in machines instead since there is not much of a difference from my perspective. I think it's reflection of the IBS management failure in the recruitment and training of their front desk staffs.
On the other hand I am MOST IMPRESSED by the IBS housekeeping staffs in ALL of my stays. They are what the front desk staffs are not. A truely welcoming, engaging, helpful and happy team. Perhaps IBS management should consider swapping their front desk with the housekeeping staffs.
I noticed that they have started having a front desk staff greet arriving guests (but not help with their bags though) as they alight from their taxi. This is an improvement over the first time I stayed there when I arrived to a deserted front entrance. Very unwelcoming experience indeed then.

The IBS room rate is about SGD180+17%(gst&service charges). By Singapore standard this is quite good value for its very convenient location, top notch room cleaniness and free in-room wifi. The rooms although small (only abt 26-28sqm) is surprisingly comfortable with very adequate designed in storage spaces (eg under bed, below and around writing desk in addition to 2 storage cabinets provided). Minimum amenities. Only a mini fridge (empty), coffee/tea/powder cream, electric kettle.
The biggest problem I have in IBS is getting a good night sleep, because their bed mattress are hard and uncomfortable.

IBS is within minutes walking distances to the followings:
-Bugis Jnct shopping mall/metro train (MRT) station
-Bugis+ (previously Illuma) mall
-OG departmental store
-Queen Street hawker centre (place to eat as the locals do)
-SimLim Tower (7-8 floors of electronic gadget shops, from mp3
players to computers/notebooks)
-famous Singapore Buddhist temple the Guan Yin Temple (just behind the IBS)
So there are plenty to do just shopping, eating and temple visiting around the IBS.
The IBS is definitely a good value place to stay at without burning a hole in the wallet. At almost SGD200 a night it's certainly not budget although it's very good value for the reasons given above. Just don't mind the poor front desk service during your check-in. Just pretend you are dealing with check-in machines and you'll be right.

It was only a short walk to the MRT. The central location is ideal. The buffet breakfast was very compete and the food was fresh.

In fact I just got back from Ibis today itself and I was excited about writing this review.
What I can say about this hotel is that, is totally perfect for business/leisure. Situated in the heart of Bugis, is just 5 mins walk to the Bugis mrt, Bugis Village, Bugis junction. perfect location for shopping! Food wise, is all over. So, it's never a problem if you're feeling hungry.
7-11 is located just next to the Ibis.

And now, as for the rooms, I would say it's a little small, but the space was ok for my friend and me. I would suggest 2 pax for better comfort. Nevertheless, if you have a bigger family, you can opt for the family room, i believe they should have. Well i stayed in the Deluxe. So i think it could fit 2A + 1C, should be no issues.
Toilet has a 3 in 1 shampoo for body and hair - is orange organic shampoo, smells good.
And the best thing about Spore is, water is safe to drink. However, I usually boil it rather than drinking raw;

Rooms comes with usb charger, mini bar, coffee making facilities and a comfy bed that made me rather reluctant to wake up in the morning.

Date of stay: September 2012,catF1,A very good no-fuss hotel,"Went to Singapore for Grand Prix weekend when hotels jack up their rates.  So we looked for a hotel that was relatively reasonably priced and one where we would still feel comfortable.  We chose Ibis Bencoolen after reading the reviews here in Tripadvisor.Location is pretty central and very accessible to all transport.  Walk about a 5-10 minutes to Bugis MRT and the rest of Singapore is in your reach.   If you're feeling lazy, walk around the hotel and there are malls and food shops and street markets.The hotel is, as another reviewer said, clean, sleek and modern.  That for me is the best way to describe it.  Not fussy and not overly decorated, but has everything you need.  Check-in was a breeze (prepaid stay) and we were up in our room within 5 minutes of arriving.  We got a twin room which is a bit smallish but still has adequate space for 2 people.  The bed was very comfortable and guaranteed a good night's sleep.  My only suggestion to the hotel is to add a couple more clothes hangers.  There weren't enough for 2 people to use for 5 days.  I also wish they provided slippers.The free wifi is a definite plus for this hotel.  There are more expensive hotels in Singapore that still charge you for internet usage.  There are 3 internet stations in the lobby as well and they have a printer ready for guests to use.At the third floor is the laundry and ironing stations.  Ironing is free and the washer/dryer are coin-operated.All in all, we were very happy with the Ibis Bencoolen and would definitely stay here again.

The best part was the free strong wifi inside the room which was great for us when trying to find information or planning our day's itinerary. The staffs were always very busy so we were not able to have a chance to interact with them as they seem to be always running around.

Date of stay: September 2012,Zen6666,Perfect!,"This is a reasonably new hotel which we originally tried out last year (2011) and decided to make it our permanent destination whenever we passed through Singapore.

We were very pleasantly surprised by just how basic the rooms were. They were smart, uncomplicated, uncluttered yet contained everything we needed - shower, beds, tv, storage areas, fridge, tea and coffee facilities.

As we were out all day we found the rooms were perfect for showering and sleeping as well as the odd few minutes we needed to refresh after a hard morning/afternoon of shopping!

The rooms were cleaned by the cleaners exceptionally well, nothing was disturbed that shouldn't have been.

This hotel is very central to MRT, shopping centres, food halls, Orchard Road etc making it so easy to walk to and from without over doing it in the humidity.

Staff are very friendly and helpful. Had no problems getting a taxi back to the airport and there is a 7 Eleven right next door making it very easy for emergency requirements.

We did not eat in the restaurant as we absolutely love Barcook Bakery just down the road on the way to Bugis. They make the best freshest breakfasts which we found cheaper and far more enjoyable than any fast food outlet.

Highly recommend this hotel to anyone intending a short stay in Singapore. Unfortunately I can't comment on how families with young children would find this hotel as there was just the two of us traveling together.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Auckland Region, New Zealand",1 ,,5.0,

Breakfast is well stocked, with good variety, and well prepared.

The staff, whether at the small bar on the ground floor, during check-in, or dealing with the minor issue I had with the free (and in the end fast wifi) are friendly, attentive and efficient.

Date of stay: September 2012,episode10,"Clean, Cool and Quiet","This hotel is well-priced and well-located near Bugis MRT station (where you can get to Changi airport on the MRT for $3 Singapore).   It is a very busy hotel; but I was checked in as promptly as the line of people at reception would permit; the young man (Melvin) who checked me in was courteous, efficient and helpful (providing me with a map of the locale and answering my brief questions about same).  The first room I was given reeked of stale cigarette smoke despite being let as a non-smoking room.  I asked for a room change and was immediately given one.  I guess it's not the hotel's fault that guests smoked in the room but that would have been apparent to the cleaners who do not appear to have ""de-smoked"" the room afterward.The second room I was assigned was clean and cool, with all of the expected amenities and most importantly quiet, so I got a good night's sleep.  A big bonus is a full coin-operated laundry and ironing room on level three.  The real gem is the onsite restaurant which has a degustation menu of sorts of Singaporean food.  I chose three dishes for $15.  The fish curry and prata was spectacular and the service was again very good (thanks to Vicky for looking after me so well).The only comment I have is that this hotel is not really within comfortable walking distance of most of the attractions and shopping in Little India for which it seems to be billed.  The walk to the Mustafa Centre took me 35 minutes in 30 degree heat.   I would suggest catching the MRT from Bugis to Farrar station to save yourself the time and  sweat...(and I am used to heat and humidity from living in Australia).Otherwise, I would surely stay again.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Queensland, Australia",74 ,100 ,4.0,

I found the breakfast buffet to be quite good.  There was always enough seating and the food was good and the food was replaced when it ran out at a decent pace.  We ate only once or twice at the hotel for dinner and it was ok.  There is a large food court type of place right out what I call the back door (the doors that taxis will droop you off at).  Out the front door (facing the major road) and next door is a 7-11 that is open 24 hours and can fill all your late night snack needs.  The metro is only a short walk away.  5 minutes or less.

Pros : Clean and tidy. Nice restaurant inside the hotel. Room size is decent. Outside view is good too. Internet is Free. They have a small refrigerator inside. Location is central. MRT is very near. Bugis street is just across a block, which is a huge plus. You can spend hours roaming on bugis street and shops inside. This sorroundings overall is very lively in the evening and weekends. There is an Indian temple (Krishna Temple) and a Chinese temple just outside the hotel.

Cons: Its expensive, 160 SGD seems to be expensive. There is no swimming pool. (I would want one, to relax after a tiresome travel during the day, if I am paying 160 !.) They dont serve food inside the room. You have to go to the restaurant to eat, which is okay. Most of the hotels around dont even have a dining inside, so this is not big deal. And there are huge eating options outside the hotel (Bugis street ). Since they have restauant downstairs, it makes sense for them to add room service as well, that will be an added benifit for travellers especially when you reach late after tiresome travel during the day, you dont want to leave the room ...

There is a kettle to boil your water for tea and coffee (but we notice that in Singapore, the hotels do not provide milk, either UHT or fresh...even at the fancy smancy MBS hotel.  You have to stick with Coffeemate (creamer).The location is very handy.  Lots of things happening around the area (Bugis Junction, Bugis+), from shopping, cafes, restaurants, food court (you should try the food in Albert Court...most meals cost SGD2.50 and they were tasty.  The place is clean enough so you should not worry about getting sick from eating there).We stayed here on our last night in Singapore (after splurging at MBS for two nights).  We took the MRT from Bayfront Station (at the MBS hotel) to Bugis.  Not much trouble to do that (yes, a bit of a walk to drag our suitcases from the station to the hotel, but it was OK).  We arrived early (noon), but our room was ready.  Sweet!  We dumped our luggage in the room and continued exploring Singapore (we went to Singapore Zoo, this I would suggest to take a taxi).We had dinner at the restaurant downstairs.  Of course, it was pricier than the food court, but the quality/taste of the foods were OK.  25% discount for the guest hotels on the set-menu and buy1-get1 free for beer.There are computer terminals at the lobby that you can use to suf the internet for free (20 minutes).  These are pretty good (even MBS do not provide this!), we could do a bit of email checking and news reading from home.Our flight back to Sydney was not until late in the afternoon, so we checked out and left the luggage at the hotel.  All easily done!  Of course, we took the MRT to get to the airport (it costs less than SGD 2 to get from Bugis to Changi airport, takes less than 30 minutes, it is on the same/green line, but you just need to change platform at Tanah Merah).We contacted the hotel prior to our stay for a room request and this was acknowledged by the hotel.

Check-in was smooth and fast
The room and bathroom is compact, clean and small yet very efficient with basic amenities
The Queen bed somewhat feels bigger than standard queen bed since it let three of us adult slept peacefully. note that the hotel doesn't provide extra bed, due to the smallish room.
For singapore standard, the location is not the best if your main transportation is MRT. about 10 minutes walk to nearest MRT stations (bugis), but there is bus stop right at the door of the hotel lobby.
The hotel is also 5 minutes walk from Albert Hawker Centre (food court of native singaporean), and Bugis Junction where you can shop for knicks knacks souvenirs.

By the way, i did try the Holiday Inn on Orchard and the Novotel on Clark Quay. Quality/price, location and service wise, I prefer the Ibis.

Obviously, rooms are the same as in 2009. Nothing to complain about in this price range. Just one thing : 2 or 3 more hangers would be usefull as there is really not much room to put your clothes. The matresses might be a bit more comfy now that they aren't any more brand new (or am I getting used to them ?).

The strong point is the service. It did really improve. The front desk' staff is very professional. There is a computer available in the lobby if you need to print out something and a lady comes quickly to help you if you need to use it. The restaurant improved a lot. The staff is great. They greet you, clean the tables, replenish the buffet ... always smiling and paying attention to the guests. Quite nice in such a busy place. And the breakfast buffet also improved : more choices, a ""salamandre"" used to keep the croissants warm ... And if you come late for beakfast, the staff is very accomodating. Also, you can see a manager coming each morning and checking things, talking to the staff about ways to improve the service.

Personally the strong signal wifi was a plus, but  the useful tv channels for attractions, hardwood door for a soundproof sleep and secure floor entry all worked towards our liking.

The experiences were consistent: the property was reasonably-priced at less than Sg $200 nightly.  My room was small but clean, comfortable and efficiently designed.  In-room amenities were all very good, save the house wifi - mine was usually extremely slow, and I made a habit of logging in at breakfast in the restaurant to check my email.The house restaurant served an excellent (but expensive at $21) buffet breakfast.  They also offered a 24-hour bar and snack menu, and a dinner menu which focused on Singaporean and Chinese fare.  Dinners were economically-priced and very good.There's a bus stop directly in front of the hotel on Bencoolen Street.  The hotel is less than one block from Sim Lim Square (though electronics & optics there are much more expensive than in the U.S.), and Wing Seong Fatty's Chinese restaurant.  The National Library is a little over two blocks away, and the National Museum and Singapore Art Museum only slightly further.About a block and a half away is the Lasalle College of Art - as of July, 2012, there's a tremendous exhibit of youth art there which is well worth the visit.  Within two or three blocks are dozens of restaurants - the hotel's in a great location.I arrived in Singapore early in the morning.  I'd phoned a few days earlier to ask about early check-in and was told the hotel was fully-booked and that wouldn't be possible.

Stayed here for two nights last weekend on our way back to the UK.
Check in was extremely quick, even though we arrived quite early, the front desk staff where very polite, efficient and friendly.
Our double room was on one of the upper floors with amazing views over Singapore. The bed was a very good size and extremely comfortable. Everything we needed was in the room, adjustable air conditioning, fridge, hang space for clothes and you could store luggage under the bed out of the way. The bathroom was a decent size with a fantastic shower. Cleanliness was top notch, extremely clean room and bed linen. The room next door had children in it, although you could hear them in the corridor, you couldn't in the room, so top marks for sound proofing. Housekeeping staff where extremely helpful and friendly too, nothing was to much trouble for them.
As our flight did not leave until the evening the front desk gave us a late 3pm check out which was much appreciated by us.
The hotel is in an ideal location, everything in Singapore is easily reached from the hotel either on foot or by MRT from Bugis.
Bugis market is just a few minutes walk from the hotel and scores of place to eat are also nearby.
We have stayed at many Ibis hotels and this was by far the best, the manager and staff should be congratulated on raising the bar.

I said first of all no i wont accept a spray to clear up the smell and that i had booked a double bed. The receptionist said no thats not what i booked.

We got to Changi Airport around 3pm and got subway (MRT) from there to bugis station, then we walked around 10 min through nice and clean streets to get the hotel (with medium size luggage). I think there is no need to take a taxi from the airport, having such a nice & cheap MRT option. We got to the front desk around 4pm and checked in very quick.

The male front desk person who check me in was stoic, expressionless and less than friendly. NOT rude to be fair. The whole affair was very ""transactional"". There is no difference if Ibis Bencoolen has put a check-in machine in his place.  On reflection, it just a case of you get what you pay. Don't expect 5 star service from a 3&half star hotel.

Date of stay: December 2011,travelstuff0000,Good Location and Value for Singapore,"I stayed at the Ibis on Bencoolen for four nights.  The hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Bugis Junction, several shopping malls and centers, Little India, the Arab Quarter, and within 15 minutes walk of the National Museum, Raffles Hotel, and Fort Canning Park. The Bugis MRT Station is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel and is one of the few MRT stations with a ticket office (10AM-9PM) where you can purchase a Singapore Pass or Multi-Day Transit Pass.I reserved a standard room and made a request for a room on a higher floor.  My request was granted without problem by the friendly and helpful front office person.  The room was a standard Ibis room; small, utilitarian, but clean and tidy and included a safe for valuables.  The bed was comfortable and not too firm as is often the case at hotels in many Asian cities.  I don’t recall if there was Internet access in the room, either via a hard wire connection or WiFi, however, three Internet connected terminals were available in the lobby for guests to use at no charge.  The room had a nice flat screen TV with a nice selection of viewing options, many in English.  There were no amenities in the bathroom except a small bar of soap.  Soap for the shower was dispensed from a container mounted on the wall.  I did not use any of the dining or bar options at the hotel as there were so many options outside of the hotel and very close by.    Overall, given the high price of lodging in Singapore, the Ibis on Bencoolen is a good option at a reasonable price if you don’t plan to spend much time in the hotel.  The air conditioning worked well and was not noisy.  Although the room, overall, was clean I noticed a few things that needed some attention.  The sheets on the bed had a few stains that appeared to possibly be from cigarette burns or possibly grease or burn marks from the laundering process (see photo).  Had the housekeeper noticed this it would have been nice to use another set of sheets.  In the bathroom I noticed mildew stains on the grout around several areas of the shower stall (see photo).  This problem could be easily corrected with some cleaning solution.  Other than these minor issues, I recommend the Ibis on Bencoolen as a good, moderately priced, lodging option when visiting Singapore.GETTING THEREFrom Changi Airport, unless someone will be picking you up or you have pre-arranged transportation, your options are a taxi (S$17-30 depending on the time of day, distance traveled, and traffic conditions), shuttle bus (S$9) which will take you directly to your hotel but may make several stops first based upon the number of passengers on the shuttle van, or by MRT (subway) for S$2.  The MRT option requires one change of trains (same platform) and about a 7-10 minute walk to the hotel.  This is only an option if you don’t have too much luggage.  I utilized the shuttle bus which was reasonably fast (45 minutes – I was the third person dropped off), cheap, and efficient.  On my return to the airport, however, my only option was a taxi given the early hour of my departure.  The shuttle usually does not run during the late evening / early morning hours and the MRT does not start running until about 5:30AM.  Taxis charge an “off-hour” surcharge.  The total fare to the airport at 4:30AM was S$28 (inclusive of the surcharge).  To reserve the shuttle, you must call approximately two hours before you need to be transported.  The service does not accept reservations any earlier.",Trip type: Travelled solo,California,637 ,232 ,,5.0
Date of stay: December 2011,Richard_Downunder700,Singapore Stopover,"I've been flying to and through Singapore frequently over the last 40 years and all that was required this time was an overnight to break our London to Sydney flight although I would be happy to stay at the hotel for longer during an extended stay.

The hotel is 25 min from Changi Apt. (off peak) by taxi and S$35/S$30 to an area I'm more than familiar with and my all time favourite restaurant ""Fatty's"" is just around the corner in Albert Street.

The hotel staff at every point of contact were efficient, friendly and most helpful. The Ibis delivers a consistenly high standard product for the price, especially in the Asian region. The rooms are small but this is a known quantity as they are a standard size throughout the brand and were meticuliously clean, comfortable and functional.

The bed was very comfortable and the aircon, when needed, worked well and the room was quiet.

If you are looking for the ""height & colour"", space and grandeur of the larger hotels, then maybe the Ibis is not for you and you should upgrade yourself to the Intercontinental, Fairmont or of course ""The Raffels"" at the commensurate increase in price.or maybe the collection of hotels on the reclaimed land across Beach Road from The Raffles but away from the local character of Older Singapore.

A full breakfast was included in the tariff, set in a pleasant coffee shop and more than what we needed to start the day.

If you are not planning on spending too much time in your room, other than sleeping, or the hotel in general and spend your time getting out and about enjoying what Singapore has to offer, then I can recommend this hotel.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",4 ,6 ,4.0,

We were quite tired from traveling so we took advantage of the restaurant downstairs a few times. The happy hour had some great appetizers. Singapore is quite small therefore we did not find it an issue to travel Singapore by walking or train, however a word of warning is that because most people in Singapore do not own a car taxis are in high demand especially late at night. For example we were coming home from a night out at Clark Quay around 11PM and had to Que for a cab for about 1 hour. Walking to Orchard street is about 15 minutes and can be quite hot for most people, but I find walking around a city gives you a feel for the culture and the people.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Calgary, Canada",26 ,14 ,4.0,

Great restaurant on premises (try the Rojak while in Singapore) which was tasty and cheap.  4 internet terminals in the foyer with free 15 minute usage.  Breakfast was average.  Great location near temples, shops and MRT train station and buses ment it was easy to do sightseeing.  Local transport in Singapore is the way to go, efficient and much cheaper than taxis.

We took double beds room, and room is smaller than we thought, but tidy, clean. We did not see the mini-bar (which is very useful, if we buy milk, some soft drink from outside.) and felt something strange at that time. However, we saw it on our second day. We stayed at the hotel 3 nights.

Have been to Singapore three times. This hotel gets my vote because of the friendly service, good value for money and convenient location to the shops and the MRT at Bugis Junction, which is only 5 minutes away on foot. It's also a 10 minute bus ride away from Orchard Road, and a 15 minute walk to Little India.

I'd stay at IBIS Singapore on Bencoolen again (have also stayed at Traders Hotel on Orchard Road, which was very nice but more expensive) because it has just what you need for a short trip of a week or less, without unnecessary extras like a gym, swimming pool and so on.

The hotel is near-new. Rooms are compact, but equipped with everything you need (tea and coffee making facilities, flat screen TV, free WiFi Internet access, USB ports next to the bed for charging your electronic devices, a small storage cupboard for hanging clothes, an in-room safe with pin code access etc). There's also free Internet access in the hotel lobby, and a laundry room on the 4th floor with washing machines, dryers and ironing facilities.

The staff are friendly yet professional. The kettle in my room was broken and fixed in ten minutes without any questions asked. The wait staff treat you as individuals, rather than just as numbers. The front of house staff are approachable and courteous. They even gave me free breakfast when my travel agent made a mistake on my booking and said breakfast was included when it wasn't!

If you book a Singapore Stopover with Singapore Airlines, you can stay at this hotel for approximately $AUD80 a night twin share, with airport - hotel transfers on a shuttle bus and you also get 50% discount off the hotel restaurant a la carte menu as well as heaps of other stuff, like free entry to Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park and other popular Singapore attractions.

the positives: good wifi connection... nothing more

the negatives: ubon arrival we wasnt welcomed by anyone of the stuff, and we had to carry our lauggage upstairs after a long time for check-in process, room was litterally lacking any complimentary stuff that you would take for granted in other hotels, basic things are missing , like refrigirators!! i called reception and they said i can keep my baby milk in the resturant fridge downstairs!! we are in 2011 or am mistaken! they said they took all fridges for maintainance for whole october :) guess they are rebuilding them.

Date of stay: September 2011,MaverickRoss,Always an enjoyable stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 nights during the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix. Anyone who has been to Singapore during this time knows that hotels get crazy expensive. The Ibis was good value and one of the cheapest (good quality) hotels around.

Location: The hotel is in a brilliant location, littlerally smack in the middle between some of Singapore's greatest locations. Little India / Arab Street / Bugis / Orchard - all within a walk of the hotel. As is the Bugis MRT which then puts you in easy reach of the whole island. If you are staying during the F1 it is possible (and even sometimes quicker) to walk to the City Hall entry gate, we did this one day when we didn't want to take the MRT.

Check-In: We arrived reasonably late (around 9:00pm) so didn't have any trouble with check-in, being an AClub member helped as well. Our room was on the 13th floor (bad luck I know), and we were at the very far end of the hallway - so no noise at all.

Rooms: The great thing about the Ibis is that they have a drink machine on each floor, I love that, because sometimes you can't be bothered walking downstairs. Our room was an Ibis Standard, no they are not massive but honestly what are you doing spending time in your room for in this city. We were travelling with 2 large suitcases and 2 carry on cases, and with a bit of planning there is plenty of room.

Bathroom: Quite a large shower area and the bathroom is big enough to be functional. They don't provide much in the way of toiletries, however there is a 7/11 and a Chemist downstairs so whatever you need you can buy quite easily.

Food: We ate at the hotel for the breakfast on our first morning, reasonable price at about SGD$20 per person, however there are so many other options nearby for your meals (check out my review of Kopitiam) that you are doing yourself a disservice eating at the hotel.

Overall: This is a great hotel, and I think now our Singapore standard hotel for future stays, its just so well located. And great value.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",671 ,110 ,5.0,

Its a no frill hotel with small but very efficiently designed open plan rooms with no closed cupboards for clothes, instead they only have open shelving. There are no clocks in lobby. I like to see a clock so I can change time on my watch and phone to local time. Service overall is excellent and even better if you ask for something, for example scales to weigh luggage are available if you ask for them. Instead of breakfast in hotel there are lots of cheaper places to eat close by.  Lots of better hotels nearby that are more expensive but also offer swimming pool, breakfast, gym etc..

My wife had an important email she needed to send at the time. To me that was extra mile. Room was pleasant and very clean. We were given a corner room and we appreciated the cool and quiet after a busy day. We got the package with breakfast included and while the food was good, I feel it can be improved. They need to have more variety. Dimsum dishes would have been a winner for me and more choices of meats and poultry maybe.

The room was small and the bathroom smaller but both were fine for our needs. It was clean and serviced daily.

The breakfast was really amazing. Huge and well worth what we paid for it. It was a nice easy start to the day. I'm sure you could fine cheaper meals elsewhere but for what you actually got it was well worth the price in my opinion.

The Room
The pictures advertised by the hotel are exactly what the room actually looks like. Small but nice looking, hard wood floors, modern bathroom and very very clean. The mattress was firm, which I didn't love, but it seemed to be good quality. Wifi is free throughout the hotel which is very practical for business travel. The only this that was lacking in the room was a mini-fridge or mini-bar, there was no where for me to store cold drinks. But there was a vending machine right next to my room, which was full of cold drinks at very affordable prices (1-1.50 SGD).

The Lobby + Front Desk
The lobby is pretty and modern and the front desk staff is very nice and go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable,

The Restaurant and Bar
The restaurant and the hotel serves a buffet breakfast for 18 SGD. A bit much for breakfast, but it had a nice selection. Food is sold all day and it was surprisingly tasty. They have a semi-fixed menu deal for 15 SGD where you choose three small dishes and that way you can taste a few different things. The bar has a happy hour deal between 17:00-20:00 with 2 for 1 drinks and the deal is valid even if you are sitting down for dinner.

Around the Hotel
The hotel is located a few minutes walk from Bugis MRT, Bugis Street and Bugis Junction. A great area to walk around in and shop. A 7-11 mini-mart is right next to the hotel and is open 24 hours.

It was a very presentable basic room, except for the mattresses.  To lie on the lino floor would probably be equivalent to the softness of the mattresses! So if you find sleeping on the floor comfortable, this hotel is ideal for you.   I phoned reception to request another room and was told that the hotel is only 1 year old, and all the mattresses are the same.  Housekeeping brought up doona’s (Duve’s) to help soften the mattress.  I had 8 layers of duva’s put on the bed before I could say my hips and shoulders aren’t going go numb anymore.  We had travelled through 7 countries in 3 months so have slept in many beds.

Date of stay: September 2011,Yalee,"A low cost brand of Accor, very helpful staff","Don't expect much from a Singapore hotel for this price and you will never be disappointed. In fact, I have to commend the management team for how helpful and upbeat the staff are. I arrived late, required express drycleaning after the cut off time and Jonathan the duty manager made some inquiries and made it happen. Of course, it came with a surcharge but this is normal. The only downside is I got a call at 7am to ask what time I needed it!

I do, however, object to late check out charges and how they are calculated. I required a 6pm check out time and was charged a full half day. Given hotels(the Ibis) allow you check in at 2pm and check out at 12 shouldn't I be allowed to stay 11hours after the 12:00pm check out deadline if I am paying a ""half day"". I am actually only staying an extra 6 hours!!! I was also told that if I stayed past the 6pm deadline that I may be subject to ""more charges"" meaning a full day........this is just unacceptable in my view and a complete scam, but that is my opinion and I am not the accountant sitting in the back rooms coming up with these policies. The Ibis will check some person after me and charge full a full day so effectively they will charge a day and half for one full day...nice little scheme! ""Cha Ching"" Also, the selling point of ""free wifi"" is a bit of a stretch given across Asian hotels wifi is just accepted as a norm.

Now past my gripes on the half day charges, the staff were helpful, attentive, very polite and very well groomed. The breakfast was good with a wide selection of good food and the amenities are functional. If you don't want anything out of the ordinary it is a good place to stay I just feel they need to build some customer loyalty through doing a few things without charging a ""fee"" for every little last thing.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Brisbane, Australia",52 ,71 ,3.0,

Looked like an upmarket hostel, not a well known hotel chain room.
Hot and humid as is apparently usual for Singapore, no rooms even had a fridge. I complained at reception as was told all fridges had been returned due to a fault in them and no rooms had fridges, not a great way to service hotel guests. Hot weather, we need to keep milk and drinks cold. But doesn't matter to Ibis apparently. The entry of the hotel is on a back street and the front of the hotel fronts onto a busy street the other side. The view from the room was to say the least..not good, had to keep the curtains closed for most of the time. From Australia...we were pleased about having the ABC Australian network on the television, caught up on AFL and the news was good but not much else was positive. Small room, small bathroom, limited toiletries, wooden floors, and not a cheap hotel in Singapore.
It serves it's purpose for a one or two night stay, but no longer than that. Outside the door is a Seven Eleven and a pharmacy, and a short walk to the shopping hub Bugis Street markets cheapest shopping in Singapore and dozens of souvenir stalls all with so many bargains amazing.
Ibis Hotel needs to lift it's game...you couldn't even use the computers, there was no access unless you had a laptop, the computers were stand up only in reception area which proved not very useful.
To go anywhere, The Ibis is far away from everything...Singapore Zoo about an hour away, Sentosa island half an hour, Singapore Flyer half an hour, Merlion Park 40 minutes, nothing close, and the transport system is chaotic so we used taxis most of the time, and they are not cheap.
The hotel is about 35minutes from Changi airport and taxi fare was $S18.
There is no microwave or cooking facilities, tea and coffee making in room, but there's not much positive about the hotel. Small foyer area looks nice and restaurant area 'Taste' is modern and stylish but the staff are atrocious and unhelpful and could not explain when fridges would be in the rooms again.

Bad:
very busy, like a major bus/train station
v slow elevators
v noisy - they were doing maintenance but still put people in rooms surrounded by construction work = greedy!!
tiniest fridge in the world - holds 2-3 small drinks
no real cable tv

Stayed here for 3 nights and never got a decent night's sleep. If I hadn't paid in advance - thru Accor's online site, would have left after 1 night. They put me just below construction - tho there were many open rooms, then moved me next to construction.
When I left, accidentally left a present from a friend - tho management knew the hotel I moved to (also Accor brand) they never notified me or made any attempt to return my gift. Cannot trust management here.
That said, if you are there when there is no construction, and get a good deal online, this can be an acceptable place to stay.

The good thing with Ibis is that if you wanted to experience the local culture, it is right at the doorstep, which will be a change if you were at the more premium hotels.

First choice was Intercontinental but we then we got an email of 50% off for Accor hotels. Ibis is the one in Bugis & we booked based on the great reviews in TripAdvisor, we felt that there must be something special for a budget 3 stars hotel to be ranked 27 in Singapore. We stayed in Royal on Scotts the first 2 days & moved to Ibis for the last 2 & oh boy, we were not dissapointed at all. Rooms are small but cosy",,"Jakarta, Indonesia",92 ,27 ,4.0,

It's walking distance to practically anywhere - Sim Lim Square, Bugis Malls, Suntec, Chijmes, Little India, Raffles, etc. For those who'd rather use today's technology, bus stop is in front of this hotel, mrt just a 3 minute walk, and Taxi's being hailed for you at the hotel's drop off point.

It has a good restaurant - Taste - where the best of Singapore foods are served at a reasonable price. Hawkers are a few steps a way as well.

Rooms are clean and spacious enough - ALTHOUGH, the one they gave me and companion this time is quite smaller than what they gave me last year when I traveled alone. My other colleague got a big one - King sized bed for single occupancy. Didn't bother asking nor complaining though since my stay was as comfortable as I imagine it to be.

Free wifi is superb!

Only things still missing in this hotel is the complimentary breakfast, pool, and room service for the days/nights that you just want to chill and relax. Could be perfect with these.

All of the hotel staff are lovely especially the ones who work in the bar and restaurant. The bar also has a happy hour from 4 - 8pm where if you buy one drink you get one free, which worked out to be good value since the average price for a beer in Singapore was around £13 and a glass of wine around the same out with these 'happy hours' which mostly every bar does!

Double rooms with only one armchair are anomalous, but it seems standard in this class of hotel. The breakfasts were good, though the layout of the buffet seemed a bit illogical, and the deals for lunch and evening meals offered an interesting range of dishes, and were good value.

The wireless Internet wasn't fantastic, so I was willing to fork out $5 for a LAN-cable (as advertised in the room), but when I asked for it at reception, I was able to borrow one for free.
Breakfast is (as with most hotels) too expensive for what it is if you have to pay on site. It's a decent buffet-style affair, but if you want Western breakfast, you may miss some cheese and the like: all you get is jam and butter. I personally don't mind, but I overheard a few other guests asking staff on duty for some cheese - without success.

City bus stop right outside the entrance; #65 takes you to VivoCity near the Harborfront from where there is connecting service to Sentosa Island and the Universal Studios theme park. Since Bencoolen street is one-way only, the return by bus #65 involves a five minute walk back to the hotel. One free wifi internet connection at good speed was offered for each of us four guests. Hotel guests got discounted prices at dinner in the restaurant. For our first stay we booked a special rate available on the web, with very good hot breakfast included as well as free tickets for a hop-on/hop-off double-decker sightseeing tour. Only snag encountered was that during the first two mornings, not all lifts were working, which entailed substantial delays for guests on their way to breakfast or check-out.

Date of stay: March 2011,rmcclaren,Terrible LIVE Band in restaurant - Simply Noise Pollution. Bad management to do so,"I am a frequent business traveller staying at Ibis Singapore, had always preferred the Ibis because if its clean, quiet and efficient capabilities. Had frequent dinners at the restaurant although I've always found it strange that such a big international hotel is always quiet for dinners at its restaurant.

But recently the hotel, for even stranger reasons, put a LIVE band made up of two kids in, of all strange places, the restaurant. It looks and feels awkward. To make things worse, this supposedly LIVE Band - sing HORRIBLY. The singing is unbearable and pain to the ears. My business members feel the same and it is embarrasing for me to recommend them to dine at the restaurant. It is so loud that it is affecting our hearing and losing our appetite. The female singer is out of tune and screeches most of the time. This is simply noise pollution and the worse LIVE music ambience we have ever experienced. What is the point of putting a band in an awkward place that can't even sing well, and put your guests to such torture?

I wondered whoever was the hotel restaurant staff felt good putting the band there, had he or she done their research homework? Was this restaurant staff kidding the Hotel Management or kidding wise, internationally-travelled customers?

When we were there, we requested to sit right at the back away from the band - the noise pollution. Then we saw a few other more guests also doing the same, they were asking the restaurant staff to sit them right at the back too. You notice those sitting in front were only the few caucasian beer-drinkers at the TV. This doesn't look very sightly and healthy. Looks more like a cheesy and tacky bar. And because of that, sometimes more horrible things happen - we saw a few girls from outside seeming to talk to these male guests. Does the Hotel Management monitor all these? It looks differently (bad) now. Certainly not what an international hotel should carry itself.

I like the Ibis Singapore and I am sure the hotel done a great job in bringing customers to the hotel seeing how busy check-ins can be, but then why would they suddenly do guests a big disfavour by putting a band there in its restaurant? Surely I did not pay to stay at Ibis Hotel to put myself to cheesy band noise pollution. The hotel should accept the fact this is a decent, Ibis restaurant where putting a band there is like forcing a duck to sing.

I hope the hotel would look into these issues and improve. The hotel may be filled with customers, but no point for all that success if the hotel doesn't stop to think and care for customers experience. Maybe the Hotel Management needs experienced and intelligent restaurant management. It is very strange that this international hotel is quiet for restaurant covers, but noisy for an unneccessary band. Bring back the peaceful ambience please.

Staff were friendly and efficient. The hotel has a bar/restaurant on the ground floor (which we did not try), a 7-Eleven next door, and a range of other restaurants within five to 10 minutes walk.

The breakfast is comprehensive and fresh. Remember if you have a ISIC international student card you are entitled to a free breakfast. We had to clarify this on a few different mornings but at the end they knew that we were the girls with the student cards.

However, despite the fact that checking in was quick, hotel front and rooms very clean, it is not the place for those who are after individuality. The ibis is the equivalent of McDonalds or Burger King - you know what you are getting and the formula never changes. It is a stop over or quick business type hotel - rooms are functional, not too small, spotlessly  clean and sealed in double glazing so a good night sleep is guaranteed.

Date of stay: December 2010,newtraveler2006,Need better trained staff and much better food,"We stayed at the hotel in December for four nights. The location is quite convenient and the room was clean. Other than that, we were quite disappointed.

We arrived late at night. In spite of making the reservation two months before, we were told that there were no nonsmoking rooms available and if we wanted, we could change rooms the following day. Since our time was pretty tight, the last thing we wanted to do was to unpack and pack again for the move, so we stayed on the smoking floor which left us with a bad impression of the hotel.

The stay did not improve much afterwards. The hotel staff was of no help when you needed any information other than how to get to all the well-known touristy places (Orchid Road, Little India, etc.) I wanted to visit the nature reserve and asked at least five people but none seemed to know where it was and how to get there. That was just one example.

Whatever you do with the food, please do yourself a favor and don't eat at the hotel. It was just terrible. I had their chili crab, the fried noodles, and the laksa – they were by far the worst food I had had through the entire trip. I had to wait for about 15 minutes just for a bowl of rice which tasted like leftover from the day before. We had stayed at other Ibis hotels, but this was the worst.

You will need to make the changes THROUGH the travel agency.... bit annoying, especially if you book as an add-on to a Jetstar flight reservation - this airline don't really know what ""customer service"" is do they? :)

Anyway. Rant mode off. The breakfast was extremely good. Reception efficient and friendly. Room extremely tiny although the decor is new. Location is OK, near to a a hawker centre but the nearest MRT station is about 800m away which may pose a problem for the elderly/handicapped/very young.

To get to Orchard rd area, you need to change at City Hall MRT. In my opinion, it is better to stay in City Hall area... several good hotels in the same quality/price.",,"Jakarta, Indonesia",903 ,43 ,3.0,

Date of stay: October 2010,APsoft,Good value in an expensive City,"Singapore is expensive for accommodation.  The IBIS is a modern (relatively bargain priced)  hotel where casual visitors to Singapore should stay if they want a ""safe"" place to book. Safe means you will get clean rooms, a good location, a restaurant in house, and amenities which will ensure you get good rest. Good wifi. However the breakfast is canteen style, nothing special and overpriced and in a City where food is  so important and available, then step outside of the hotel and go eat at one of the local eateries close by for a fraction of the price, and get the ""feel"" of Singapore. Downside of this hotel is that check in and checkout peaks mean you need to be patient, and getting a cab out of the hotel in the  8-9am time frame can sometimes result in delays.

The rooms are small and simple with comfortable beds, a small flat screen TV, a tiny fridge and a shower only bathroom. There are no great views from the windows other than the hussle and bussle of this busy area of the island.

The staff were amazing - giving my elderly parents in law very early check in and a very late check out. In fact, we booked four rooms on two different floors and they applied this policy to one of the rooms on each floor. For this reason, we decided to stay over again on our way back from Europe although our original plan was to try a different hotel.

The location is excellent - walking distance from the famous Bugis street markets and better still from the enclosed Parcos Bugis Junction Mall which is a much better and often cheaper option for shopping than some of the overpriced Orchard Street shops.

Right near the hotel is a small mall where I had the singularly best hairwash and dry for under AU$20. I love the service provided in this country - people really seem to care about what they deliver and do it with all their heart.

Other hints: Singapore Taxis are very reasonable, but the buses are nothing less than cheap. If you have the energy, they are a wonderful option to get around.

In conclusion, I would definitely stay there again even though it is not a luxurious fancy hotel and it may be slightly overpriced for its facilities but it is clean, accessible with a great attitude.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",2 ,,4.0,
Date of stay: October 2010,Maiel,Functional,"Check in was a breeze. Took me only 5 minutes or so.
Don't expect anyone to help you with your luggage. I took all of my 4 bags by myself using the airport cart which, was available by the hotel lobby. Weird, I know, but it helped me... I even had to ask the front desk clerk if it was alright for me to bring it upstairs and they said yes.
My room was small, maybe around 30 square meters. It had a flat screen tv, a desk and of course a bed which was functional and comfortable as well.
The bathroom had a shower and was compact, but did its purpose nonetheless. There are no bathtubs here, but at least, the shower area had a glass partition between it and the toilet to prevent the entire bathroom from being wet.
Initially, I had difficulty dealing with the faucet because only hot water was coming out. I had to call the maintenance and they came in after about 15 minutes. Funny, but all he had to do was switch the sticker from lef to right since the blue color which indicates ""cold water"" was positioned wrongly (it was on the side of the hot water). He was also kind enough to tell me how to use the faucet.
My room came with free buffet breakfast and unlimited wifi, which incidentally was my main reason for choosing this hotel, apart from it being close to my area of business.
The breakfast was okay, there was enough selection for anyone, although it can get tiring after the 2nd day, since they pretty much serve the same thing.
I looove their coffee.
The unlimited use of the internet was great and the speed was just right.
Getting a cab from this area is easy, my longest wait was 5 minutes.
Chinatown and bugis market is just a few blocks away, very good for those who want to get good bargains.
There are a couple of sights to see nearby, like a Chinese temple and a museum.
Check out took about 15 minutes. I paid in cash and while they mentioned that they will cancel the reservation they made with my credit card provider at the start of my stay, to this day, they still haven't. which reminds me, I need to call them again.
Overall, this hotel works for any business traveller.

There was a 7-11 store attached to the hotel. 2 bus stops located in front of the hotel and a short walk to Bugis MRT station. So, getting to/from the hotel was easy.

There were plenty of shopping spots around this hotel. Sim Lim Square for electronics. Bugis Junction for clothes and accessories. Food Centre was located just a short walk on the back side of the hotel.

We had a really nice surprise when we found out our hotel paid for the open top bus tour. This saved a lot of money and with the hop in hop off option meant we paid only $1 total fir a days travel when we finally had to catch a late night bus.

The room price was the same as you pay in Australia for the same size so we thiught it was good value.  I could not speak highly enough of the helpful staff.  The location is great .. about a 5 minute walk from Bugis MRT which you can catch from the airport for about $1.40 (15 minute ride).  On the way to the hotel you walk through the Bugis Market which is full of street stalls but i must reccomend the icecream sandwich form the little carts.  They cost $1 and are delightful (they were on the amazing race!).  There is also a food court that locals eat at where you can get breakfast for about $2.50 if you dont mind asian food (the Roti and curry is to die for).  Also ask for the free city tour..its great to find your bearings and see where you might want to go back to.  You can also hop on-off wherever the bus stops along the way.  Do take a harbour cruise at night..the view is spectacular.  I loved it so much i am going back with my kids this time as it is a clean and friendly place i feel safe taking them along (unlike some other asian countries),Trip type: Travelled with family,"Geelong, Australia",72 ,46 ,5.0,

Date of stay: September 2009,wanderer087,Not bad,"I stayed at the Ibis for 2 nights during a business trip. Although not cheap, it was reasonably priced as compared to other hotels i found in Singapore.

The room and bathroom were extremely small but had been quite cleverly designed to utilize the limited space efficiently. There was an LCD TV with, free wi-fi, electronic safe, but did not have a tea/coffee-maker.

I had forgotten my hairbrush so asked the reception if they could provide me with one, but I was told they dont have any. This was rather strange since most hotels I've stayed would provide basic items like this on request. However it wasnt much of a problem since there is a 7/11 store right around the corner.

The location is very convenient, its about a 10 minute walk to Bugis station and there are a bunch of restaurants around the hotel.

Cost was about US$240 for 2 nights (breakfast NOT included!!). I paid separately for the breakfast ( I think it was SGD15) and it was a good continental spread.

for me though, the bathroom could be improved. it was a tad bit too cramped and the space around the sink could barely fit a water glass. the hairdryer was too high up (but ok, im only 5'1 tall) and the cord was too short for comfort, but it worked anyway.

i opted for just the room rate, w/o breakfast, as previous reviews i read said it wasnt worth the add'l cost - they were right, as fas as i saw from the resto area. anyway, the hotel's fab location can get you to any of the gazillion shopping malls and restos around the city in no time. also, with its great location, it's practically a stone's throw away from a chinese temple and a hindu temple, where you can easily observe the locals' religious rituals. about 6 mins walk would take you to the end of the street where the singapore art museum is - good stuff! check out when they offer free entrance. you'll also pass by a quaint art studio/resto, that i didnt get a chance to fully explore, also a jewish temple! i even sighted black-clothed/hatted men coming out.

the hotel seemed to be very popular with lots of sr. citizen tour groups, i had to wait in line for about 15-20 mins behind some elder tourists, cos they was just so many of them! although, since i pre-booked online, the actual check in was a breeze, a snap even, i simply had to present the confirmation email. with the bright red staff uniforms and speedy check-in, it kinda felt like i was at McD's, ordering take-out: no frills, in-and-out, stat!

We made our booking months in advance as we would be travelling with a newborn and a toddler. Our two requests were for interconnected room which were non-smoking (my son is asthmatic). Neither request was met UNTIL I threw a tantrum at reception, when two interconnected, non-smoking rooms suddenly materialised. However there was no assistance given to get us up to the rooms

Then it took another half hour for housekeeping to open the doors between the rooms, and another hour for the requested baby cot to appear. By this time my baby daughter had vomited on herself (this is what happens when a baby cries and mother unable to attend to her because no baby supplies, no room and no-one to help!) Houekeeping claimed they had no buckets to soak baby clothes (have you ever heard of a housekeeping department with no buckets?!) I ended up having to call a relative in Singapore to get on brought in! The hotel also has no baby bath (in fact, no baths at all) and expects you to wash your baby in the sink.

I was upset by the service received and formally complained, but they were unwilling to offer anything to improve our stay (bigger room, complimentary night, or breakfast next morning etc.....

Everything was clean, house-keeping was great. There was a mini bar fridge and an inroom safe, as well as free wii-fii which is all we wanted.

The area is great, its about a 10/15 min walk to Orchard St and the real shopping, which was a bit long with bubs, but it was only a 5 min walk to Bugis St, which was then only a few stops away right into the heart. The walk to the station was great, it went right through a really large outdoor market where I got 3 wallets for $10, $10 handbags and $1 ice-creams (needed as its so hot!)

Across the road is a Burger King if needed, a few other restaurants around the place and a food court at the bottom of Sim Lim - a HUGE electronics store where we picked up some amazing bargains on netbooks, cameras and iphone stuff.

All in all I would stay there again, it's nothing to rave about. The breakfast was $15 a head, so its cheaper to venture out, but we did eat there a few times, because it was a huge buffet.

The location is central but not really close to anything. Bugis is a 10 minutes walk and it is a good 25 minutes walk to go to Clark Quay or Orchard Road. There is a couple of convenient stores near the hotel and a drugstore.

Breakfast is average but quite cheap though. It is a self-service. Hot dishes aren't very hot. At 8 o clock, the place looks like an overcrowded hospital's cafeteria. The staff is dynamic and hard working, considering they are not so numerous for all the customers.

Front desk staffs are fast ... but it would actually be nice if they took a little more time and tried to be more helpful. They check in and out and obviously don't want to be bothered with customers problems. I wanted to have my stay registred on my A-club Accor card but they told me my card's number was invalid and neither of the two people I talked to offered to check on it with the A-club team.

Then many guests solved their problem by coming down and use wifi at the lobby, the only place they can connect.

Why don't those officer surprise that so many guests coming do to use wifi at the lobby? :(

This hotel is CLEAN! Even though the room is kinda small (might be something to think about if ur travelling with children etc), it is squeaky clean, and the bathroom is spotless and even smell nice!

Check in was fast and simple, and as they don't have any porter/bell boy, you'd have to carry your luggage(s) to your room yourself.

We were travelling with an infant; with an infant cot and all the baggage, there is almost no room for movement in the room.  Having said this, Ibis delivers for its unbeatable price.  Singapore hotels are generally more expensive than Malaysia and Thailand.  If you are in Singapore  for few days and expect to spend most of your day in Singapore sightseeing and don't expect being pampered like a king then this hotel is a clear winner. Location-wise Ibis is close to more than one MRT and also very close to Little India.  The latter throws up a landmine of choices for food within walking distance for an Indian traveller (especially a vegetarian one).I have stayed in Ibis in Dresden, Germany, and must admit that they are impeccably consistent in their service delivery.Overall, I would rate Ibis on Bencoolen a great option for a budget traveller.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Mumbai, India",11 ,6 ,4.0,

Staying at the Ibis is very much like eating at Burger King when traveling in a foreign country – it gives a sense of familiarity, looks clean and has nothing to do with where you are. Seems like the concept is working well and the hotel was quite busy.  Location is good, although it looked quite deserted at first glance.

Breakfast is ""OK"" for $15, but if u stay for many nights, then u'll feel not much things to eat since u r eating the same food.

My Comments:

Since I'm going alone to Singapore this time, I planned to get less expensive hotel. I aimed was to find one with cheap price, nice-looking interior, convenient location, preferable new, and preferable without much hotel factilities (e.g pools, gym).

This ibis hotel fits all my requirements.

The price is among the lowest in hotels in Singapore! It's kind of no-frills hotel without any facilities except for the restaurant (I won't need a pool or gym or business center in my solo leisure trip anyway) and hence the lower price.

The hotel is still very new and the lobby decoration is decent. The check-in is very fast; I waited for 2 minutes, and then took 3-4 minutes before I start moving my lugguage to the room at 8/F.

The room simple yet very nice. Everything is still very new. Size of room is okay for 2 person (hence very spacious for one), with plenty of space for placing lugguage and plenty of desk space for placing belongings during the stay. Since there are no tall buildings near the hotel, the room is very well lit during daytime even without any lights on.

Toilet size is, again, OK for a 'budget' hotel, enough room to stand 3-4 person. Water pressure for both basin and shower is strong and the temperature of the water is manageable (i.e. not those 'either-very-hot-or-very-cold type). Toilet flush button is so big that a man without fingers can push them. No conditioner nor toothpaste/toothbrush is provided though. The shower is big enough for two person (didn't try - too bad) and the floor tiles has edges a bit too sharp.

The bed is comfortable. The pillow is a bit soft - I asked if there are less soft pillows but the staff told me there is one type of pillow for the hotel. (Too bad, but acceptable for budget hotel.)

The surroundings: MANY restaurant/eating places! There are three shopping center with big food courts filled with chain restaurants (e.g. pizza hut, KFC, etc) within 5 minutes walk; two food courts with local food a street away; some budget food in the Fortune Center just next to the hotel; a street with bar and nice (expensive) restaurant also a street away; and also a few nice-looking restaurant in this and nearby hotels. Finding food is not a problem. There is even a 24-hour local restaurant across the street. Besides food, there are shopping malls, busy market street, convenient stores and hawkers - good if you like to stay near a busy area. It is still busy by 9pm, but become very quiet by 11pm.

To conclude, it's a very decent hotel (if you're only need a nice room). Location is convinent, close to MRT, food and shoppings. Room is cosy and NEW. Complimentary wireless internet gives me enough reason to stay; most hotel in singapore need $$$$$ for the internet. I didn't talk much to the staff during the stay, but for those limited occassions (checkin, checkout and asking for harder pillow) they are very responsive and kind. A longer opening hour of the hotel restaurant would be nice though - it closes at 10pm - it's closed when I return to hotel after seeing shows.

Also, it'd be nice if I could choose double bed or twin bed on the online booking service - I can only ask for availability of double bed room upon arrival.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Hong Kong, China",11 ,6 ,,5.0

Date of stay: April 2009,sss1970t,Not a good business hotel,"Not a great business hotel.  I stayed at the Ibis for 2 days / 1 night.  I had a tight schedule of meetings, and had to also finish shopping for the family in those 2 short days.  Hence, time was of the essence.  As the hotel is very new, most tax drivers are not aware of how to get to the lobby.  Hence, it would be a good idea to keep a map with you or understand the directions that you should inform the cabbie about.  There is no taxi stand nearby, and in the rainy weather, prooves to be a pain.  The check in was very smooth and quick and I am very grateful that they were kind enough to give me a room at 9am.  I was given a room on level 14  Once in the room, I found the room (a twin) to be very small indeed.  However, it was clean and fresh. The bathroom was small too, and",,"Singapore, Singapore",51 ,33 ,3.0,
Date of stay: April 2009,Shockers,Ibis - the well placed hotel,"This hotel is a friendly well run operation and when something needs attending to  it is dealt with quickly.   There is a bar and restaurant facility, coin operated laundry facility and a free internet service.   The hotel is positioned on the edge of the Bugis district with it's temples, market stalls, shopping malls and an MRT station (10 mins) - all life is here.   MRT trains and busses are regular but why bother you would be hard pressed to spend Stg £5. on a taxi in central Singapore. TIPS.   Alcohol is a wicked price - bring a bottle or two.

It is also a short distance to the shopping and entertainment areas of Orchard Road, Suntec City and Clarke Quay. The hotel offers a good alternative to the traditional accommodation area of Orchard, where hotels tend to be much pricier. It must be said that this hotel is no-frills - no doormen, no luggage service, no good restaurants, no fitness center and pool, etc. It is basic but very good accommodation. The rooms are small and the fridge a tiny thing.

Room and bathroom small but again all you need for a short stay.  The location is fantastic right amongst Singapore life and a short walk to MRT and surrounded by shops and restaurants, overall we are glad we have tried this hotel and would definitely return if money was a factor, although we do miss a swimming pool so will be off to the Sheraton for the 2nd part of our stay in",,,2538 ,55 ,4.0,

Date of stay: March 2009,ML-Ireland,Early reviews were critical  but it gets better and better.,"Stayed for five nights in March 2009. Brand new very large hotel which opened this February 2009. Lovely modern feel and good room with high ceiling but not very large. Staff very helpful (if anything hotel is overstaffed). Rooms spotless and bathroom fittings of very high standard. Beware of the small step going going down into the bathroom. This hazard of unexpected drops is very common in Singapore streets and buildings.  Wardrobe tiny and miserable.  Sound insulation to street and adjoining rooms excellent but less so to hotel corridor.   It might seem pricey by international standards but good value when you know that accommodation is away over-priced in Singapore. I did not dine in but with all Singapore on  the doorstep, why should I?  Convenience store right next door,",,Ireland,3 ,5 ,4.0,

LIttle India was about 10 minutes walk away. We had breakfast outside of the hotel. It was much cheaper.

Ibis are raising the bar against other chains here with a 'boutique' approach that is reflected in an excellent restuarant and lobby - complete with designer furnishings - and rooms that match with everything you'd need including a mini fridge and free safe.  The showers are particularly nicely done (if a bit small I guess if you are on the large side).   I had a great view from my room too as I was placed, as requested, on a higher floor.  The location is pretty good near bus and MRT (Bugis) routes and there are loads of shops around (inc 24 hour ones).

Room rate is little bit higher comparing with other Ibis (in other country), but considering room rate in Singapore very high, Ibis Singapore room rate still acceptable.

The small problem is the service, i didnt find any greet everytime i enter the hotel, no one help us with the luggage when we checked in.On second day, my room card cant work on elevator and when i asked reception desk, they just simply activated it, meaning my room card is deactivated on second day.

Date of stay: February 2009,ExoticTravel011,"It's OK, but...","This IBIS is brand new, so the rooms are comfortable. However, the staff seemed indifferent and was not particularly helpful.  Although they assured us this was like every other IBIS and there would be the 5AM  'early riser' breakfast, it did not happen, so we went off to the airport without coffee for our early long haul  flight. I know it is a small point, but it is one of the reasons I stayed there. Also on the downside, the property is between two subway stops, and that means at least 15 minute walk to the MRT transport. This was a problem in the heat and the downpours. The Bencoolen area is dicey and there is really no nice decent places to eat around the hotel. There are places, but they seemed dirty and  low end.  Last of all, a hotel at this price in Singapore attracts all kinds, so there was almost constant door slamming and yelling in the halls all night.

A friend recommended me to their online contest to publicize the hotel called Pay What You Want. Since I was coming to Singapore on vacation with family, I booked 3 nights using this scheme at very low rates [S$25~$35]. This was a steal.

The location is great - very close to shopping and decent eating joints. It is also centrally located to Bugis and City Hall metros.

The room with a queen size bed was decent as was the bathroom. The in-room fridge is very small - can't hold a 1 litre water bottle. The safe didn't work as per the instructions and they couldn't get it fixed.
