Water pressure is good and no restrict on hot water. There is no shower curtain or door so the floor and toilet bowl a bit wet after shower. But it will dry overnight, not a big question.
Sound insulation is acceptable, can’t hear noise at night. But I feel like the music playing in corridor is annoying in the morning and also can here sound of housekeeping making room upstair or neighbours.
Also the location is good, it nears two mrt stations ,bus station on the opposite side and can walk to bugis around 10 minutes.
There has a small centre where included famous ya kun kaya toast and dessert.

Date of stay: August 2023,566melanie,Comfortable and cosy,"There’s a lot to like about Hotel G, the towels are fluffy, the bed’s comfortable, and the service is friendly and prompt. The housekeeping staff, Ras in particular, were very efficient and helpful. I even broke a glass by accident one evening and a staff member arrived pretty quickly with a vacuum cleaner to clear it up.

Some reviews have complained about noisy neighbours, but the only time we ever heard people outside our room was briefly in the corridor outside. Nobody was ever so noisy that we couldn’t sleep.

Space is at a premium in Singapore and Hotel G have done their best to make their rooms comfortable in a limited space. The bed in our room was against the window to maximise floor space, meaning one of us had to climb over the other to get to their side. Not an issue for us, but if your mobility limited it would be frustrating. The bathroom is small and the shower doesn’t quite wet the toilet, but it’s close. The sink is outside the bathroom, but not facing the bed so it didn’t feel like it was in the bedroom. Some people might not like that, it didn’t bother us.

Getting to hear from the airport is a breeze. Get off at Expo and get the DT line to Bencoolen. It’s a 2 minute walk from there.

There’s a lot to do, easy to get around on the super cheap buses, and the Fortune Centre across the road had some excellent food.

Overall a comfortable place to stay for a few night in Singapore and worth the price.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Brisbane, Australia",19 ,14 ,5.0,
Date of stay: August 2023,Bobby Risotto,An overall terrible experience,"Pros:
- soft bed
- decent location

Cons:
- The shower floods the entire bathroom every time the shower is on for more than 15 seconds because the floor is not sloped towards the drain and there’s nothing blocking the water. It becomes necessary to use all towels in the room to mop up the floor
- Bathroom and parts of hotel smell of mold or mildew
- Lots of noise from outside and inside. Strange popping noise from windows at random times often waking me up. Noisy AC (the hotel fixed this after complaining). Loud doors that slam shut ensure you wake up along with the first person on your floor.
- Air conditioning behaves strangely. I kept AC at 20 at all times but sometimes it would become very cold or hot over night",Trip type: Travelled solo,,3 ,,,1.0

Am still presently a guest at the hotel and the service is truly what another reviewer described as a 4-star hotel but with 5-star service.

Special thanks and shout out to Yvonne, Daryl, Nana and also Diana & Tan from reservations who embody what excellent service mindset is. Their cheerfulness, attentiveness and helpfulness have made my stay to-date a very pleasant one.

As part of the hotel’s Green drive, guests need to request for Make Up Room when required which is great. I would like to commend Sheeba from housekeeping who greeted me warmly and checked with me if I wanted my room to be done when I bumped into her at the corridor. I thought it’s nice that on her own initiative, she decided to check with me even though a yes would have meant more work for her. 😜

The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to bus services and walking distance to MRT stations. There’s a wide variety of food places catering to different budgets and cuisine preferences around the hotel.

I’ve hosted a business meeting at Ginett, a bistro-style French restaurant and wine bar, based in the hotel. The food was great and it has a nice buzzing environment. Yet to try the hotel’s other restaurant, 25 degrees, a burger bar.

My husband and I have a preference for windows, so if you are booking these rooms be thoughtful that spaces are engineered for your necessities not for spending time inside. Therefore my only request was to have windows and I was certainly happy about this - my small room had two! I was well impressed by the bathroom too - in other hotels. You will find that they keep no distance between the shower and your loo, this one has plenty for a tiny bathroom. Great views and decoration, amenities are top-notch, and my bed was fabulous.

Tried the new card didn’t work and back to reception to try to regenerate the card (3rd time). Then it didn’t work and down for the 4th time. Finally concluded that it must be the battery. Ask how long I have to wait. However technician is quick to respond in 10 mins but after 4 times up and down the floors.

Another issue is DND/MUR sign. In most hotel, one side is dnd and the other is mur. But this hotel has one side dnd in English and another is DND in Chinese. How non Chinese speaker figures this out. I hang the sign at the know earlier in the morning and came back had the issue with door lock and room aren’t clean. Inform the receptionists and told him that I understand now, i will not hang any sign tmr and pls make sure to clean my room tomorrow. However, housekeeping showed up at my door in 15 mins ready to clean my room. Although it’s prompt service, I didn’t call for. I ended up going out and let them clean the room.

Hotel is conveniently located within walking station from DTL and NWL stations. Apart from location, there are some great amenities within the area like hawker centre and shopping malls. Reception services at the front desk are great and hassled free. I was served by Nana and was explained clearly on my queries. Room was great in my opinion and it felt cosy. It's not the usual hotel kinda sizing but it felt sufficient as a boutique hotel. Breakfast at 25 Degree was great too, love it's breakfast there.

At the get-go, we were warmly welcomed by Hema at the reception and she was welcoming and went above and beyond to accede to our small requests; such as storing our items and explaining the dinner options at Ginett.

She also helped to put us in a upgraded room with a balcony that was a pleasant surprise for us to sip on our wine after dinner.

However, there was some technical faults and we were not able to fix it though a technician tried to help us. The staff on duty on the night shift was not helpful and seemed to have a cold start to his shift. Wished to have spoken to Hema instead. But all is well.

The room was cosy and nice but perhaps a deep clean and the little hiccup would make it a 5/5.

At the checkout, we were met with Daryl who was stellar as well. He was quick to assist the queue and had a warm smile to end off the stay.

He explained to me the packages available, patiently. As I decided to make the booking only in the late evening, he double checked our late arrival to ensure a seamless check-in experience.

Upon reaching the hotel drop-off, Natalie went out of her way to assist with the door as I was transferring my grandma over to her wheelchair. Check-in was a breeze and Daryl offered to change to a room that allows my grandma to move around easily. That was a very thoughtful and kind gesture.

Once we settled down in the room, Daryl even offered to send up a stool to be placed in the shower so that it would be easier for my grandma. He definitely went out of his way and truly exceed our expectations, especially during these trying times.

Staff are prompt to address feedback of the noise at 2am when called.  There are some good green initiatives in the hotel.

Date of stay: September 2021,my_traveller,"Security issue, No fridge, 4.45pm make up room, 11m2 room, $15 parking, incomplete bf set","No fridge, 4.45pm make up room. Housekeeping knocked door twice, within that 2 seconds, and then tap card come in (without my approval). before I could reach the door from the bed, the housekeeping already tapped into my room. Security is really a concern. Called many times no one picked up call. Incomplete breakfast set. Parking is $15 per exit. Bible inside safe box, underneath your bed. No bathtub in all rooms.

For Hotel G, there are 6 types of room. Single (10m2), Good Queen (11m2), Good King (12m2 to 13m2), Great King room (15m2 to 16m2), Greater King (27m2), Family Room (24m2). Basically the hotel rooms are ""cut"" into very small parts. Typically for 4* hotel in Singapore, with more than 300 rooms, their hotel room sizes are usually 24m2 to 28m2 for their lowest tier room. For Hotel G, their room size configuration would most probably be 2m x 5.5m or 6m for their good queen/king room. Parking is $15 per day (one time exit). Meaning to say if you exit after 1 hour, your $15 would be gone too. Otherwise, parking is $2 per hour, or $1 per 30 minutes. Parking road is very narrow, hence be cautious.

Personally wont recommend family or elderly, or family with kids to stay in Hotel G as the room size is too small. About 5 meters by 2.2 meters with a private bathroom inside. Hotel G is located about 7 minutes walk from Bugis+ or 12 minutes walk from Bugis MRT station.

The hotel parking entrance is in a seluded inner area. Hotel Entrance is beside 25 degree burger restaurant at level 1. However, the dropoff point is at level 2, together with the carpark. From level 1, you have to check in and scan the trace together app or tap your token. Then carry your luggages and climb the stairs to the lift at level 1.5 to go to level 2 to check in. Small check in counter area with 3 counters and few staff manning that area. Staff are generally below 30 years old, looking quite young.

Room
-No fridge
-1 charging port only. Either boil your kettle or charge your things.
-bible inside the safebox
-bed was too soft to our likings. If you are alright with soft beds, with a 2m x 5.5m room size, this is your ideal staycation for you.
-bad soundproof. Next door people keep plugging their adaptors in and out, could hear very clearly. Also have noises coming from the room above us. If there is no occupancies in both the rooms, then the hotel could be haunted. Because the noise keep surfacing very often in our entire stay.
+2 usb charging port
+Few overseas channels. BBC Earth, HBO, Fox, no natgeo, animal planet, etc
+Television is about 32inch
+Air-con is quiet and can go as low as 16 degrees.
+Decoration of the room and ambience is nice, but the room is very small as mentioned by many people on tripadvisor and other OTA platform reviews.

Bathroom:
-Water pressure is strong. But too strong to the extend where you feel a stint each time the water hit onto your body surface
-Low water pressure for washing basin.
+Good warm and cold water
+Handheld and standing shower
+Toothbrush and toothpaste
+Face towel and bath towel

Breakfast
You have to take lift to level 1. Then walk down the stairs, exit the building. Go to the right to look for 25 degree burger restaurant. From there, take the paper menu and choose the set you want. They have western, chinese, Waffles, light breakfast. One person only entitled to one set. The set comes with fruits, crossiant, tea or coffee.

For our meals, the lady has given us an incomplete set of breakfast. Missing 1 coffee etc. I have to travel all the way down, wait for the lift, and exit the building to go to 25 degree restaurant. Since they were busy with 4 dine-in customer and 4 customers waiting to pick up their breakfast, waited for about 5 minutes before I was attended by the female staff who has given me an incomplete set of breakfast with missing item. She told me to go to the front office to collect.

It included complimentary parking, complimentary sparkling wine, a prop box (that needs to be returned at the end of your stay), complimentary early check-in (12pm) and late check-out (5pm), two burgers with a side and $50 Ginett dining credits.

The room is pretty small, with the sink on the outside of the bathroom. I quite like it however because it has a cozy feel. Room was very clean. All toiletries were provided (vanity kit, shower cap, sanitary bag, hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothbrush & toothpaste). There is complimentary tea and coffee that you can use in the room as a kettle is provided. 2 complimentary boxed water were also provided in the room.

No smoking in the room either, partner had to leave the premise to smoke outside the hotel. No fridge and no microwave however. If you would like to microwave something, you need to bring it down to the reception desk and they will help you to do it. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were very quick.

The only downsides were that there was no mini fridge, no power plugs near the bed, and after showering, the floor near the toilet bowl will get really wet because the water doesn't drain fast enough. Air conditioning cannot be adjusted. Only 1 keycard was given. Pillows were too flat (even though 2 were provided).

The bigger sized room definitely gave us more space to put our bulky items as well as getting makeup done. The room was very clean, space was pretty okay, all basic necessities were there. What I like most about the room is the platform which the bed was on. I was able to put many bags and things on the platform instead of having to put them on the floor. Toilet was quite spacious for this price of the room. Shower gel, hand soap, shampoo, conditioner smells of lavender and bergamot which I am a big fan of lavender scent. Although the bed was really comfortable, the hotel should work on their pillows as they are losing their fluffiness. Other than that, my husband and I really enjoy our stay.

Please note that the laundry and slipper bags are charged at a nominal fee. Would suggest to provide another alternative option if guests were to do their own laundry back home (i.e. paper bags for laundry if environment friendly option is a concern to do plastic bags).

Date of stay: December 2020,Kenji,Noisy as hell.,"Staycation gone wrong. Rooms are not soundproof. If you have neighbours beside u in the next room, u can practically hear their talking and laughing.

Ceilings also has this creaking contracting sound at night. Could be due to the wood or tiles. If some1 is staying above u , u can practically hear the chair shift n their heavy steps.

As much as we try to keep it simple & enjoy this staycation, we were rudely awoken at 12.30am till 1.30am by the next door neighbours grp of 4 giggling, laughing, incessant chatting till we couldn't take it and called concierge.

Security guard found there were 4 ppl in the room instead of registered 2 person. Makes u wonder how lax security is. I went over to tell them off as the security does not seem to impose any authority. Disappointing to say the least.

This was one of the worst hotel to stay in. Mind u, we were on the 9th flr. Every night we can hear what happens in the room besides us. And yes the walls are paper thin, even worse than some 40 year old hdb flat walls.

We have stayed at hotel rei, moon hotel, yotel hotel etc, none had this sound insulation issue like hotel G.

Date of stay: December 2020,burtschips,Musty smell but good service recovery,"Checked in on 19 Dec 2020. Took a shower and decided to take a nap. However there was a musty smell coming from the bed. We thought that it was from the duvet and requested to change the cover. The cover was changed but the smell came back. It must be the duvet then. Informed reception and they advised that housekeeping would change the whole duvet and send us some water too.

Water was sent to us but the other request was not passed to the housekeeping. Explained to the housekeeping staff and she brought us a new duvet. We must compliment the housekeeping staff as she was really courteous and nice throughout the entire ordeal.

With the new duvet, we thought our worries were all resolved. Alas, a few minutes later, the smell was back. This time round, we decided to sniff for the source and finally found a spot in the mattress. It smelt like urine. Called up the reception. They apologised and told us that they would change the room. Called them again after 45 mins and the reception staff’s reply was “Oh my colleague hasnt called you? Let me check and call you back.” Then she called back and told us to go down to the reception to exchange the keys. Brought all the barang barang to level 2 , exchanged for the new keys before heading to the new room.

Wrote this review on my first night stay in the new room. Yes the new mattress has no smell. ""But my pyjamas are already stained and so is my first experience with Hotel G.""

Update:
20 Dec 2020

Woke up for breakfast and was greeted by the staff at the restaurant's entrance. Upon getting our room number, he checked in with us on the new room and whether everything is ok now. This is a very warm gesture.

Breakfast was simple but good! Try the eggs special! Caramelised onion, bacon, chopped veg.

Got back to the room and the bell rang shortly after. The front desk staff was outside and he sincerely apologised for the bad experience once again. At this moment we felt bad for leaving the bad review. There was really nothing to fault for the service. The hotel's service was really good. It's just an unlucky day for us due to a bad mattress.

We accepted his offer to clean up our stained pyjamas. And here I am, updating this review on the second day of my stay with renewed confidence that this experience may not be that bad after all.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,3 ,2 ,4.0,

For the price I paid, its value for money for Singapore standards. Nice and clean but its a tiny room. If you pay slightly more, you can opt for M Social on Klook and get a bigger room.

Pros: Nice and clean but really no facilities in the hotel. Eateries near hotel and Bugis is a 5 min walk. The service staff was prompt in her emails, etc. Excellent service overall...

Date of stay: July 2020,Aurora,Used to love but not for this time,"I use to visit hotel G very often and liked it very much. However this time it has been very disappointing.

1) Room we have booked is Great King room. Naturally anyone would expect it to be a king size bed. However I discovered it was actually merged by 2 single beds and there is a gap in between which makes the sleep very uncomfortable. Mattress was also harder and less comfy compared the the queen room bed I used to book

2) The room was quite clean as usual however what I noticed was the remote control. It was very dusty and greasy with dirt stuck in the spaces between the keys.
I would have expected that after reopening in phase 2, the hotel would have managed the cleaning and sanitization well. Moreover, the remote control is something which people have their hands on and the more it should be cleaned and sanitized. I had to use my own alcohol swab to clean it before using it :(

3) Booking I made come with breakfast. However instead of a buffet spread it only had 5 items on the list to choose from. This part is understandable due to the covid 19 since buffet is not allowed yet. However the part which was surprising was when I asked about the coffee and tea options, the lady serving told us it’s not included in the breakfast and have to be charged separately. She even used the fact that coffee and tea are available in your rooms thus they do not provide. Does the hotel expect guests to bring down their mugs and tea bags down for breakfast?

We booked a Family Room which has an interesting configuration - 2 separate rooms (1 with queen bed and 1 with double bed each with its own bathrooms) accessed through 1 main door.  My 20 yr old loved it as he had his own room.   Rooms are quite small, had to strategically open/store our 2 full size luggages.  The space under the bed isn't big enough to fit our large size luggage. Above all, the bathroom layout is the most inconvenient.  Inside the bath area is the toilet and rain shower, which is impossible to put your clothing inside (everything becomes wet). Outside the sliding door is a basin with barely enough countertop to place 2 cups and a razor.  It would be nicer to install some hooks to hang face towels /",,"Markham, Canada",15 ,30 ,4.0,

Maybe i’m too selfish, but just wanted to crush on the bed and have a beer. Well, that will not work. Because MasterCard (embossed) debit cards - which are by the way called ‘world elite’ for whatever reason - will not be accepted by the hotel for deposit, meaning that the minibar will be removed from our room. Not just the contents of the minibar, but the complete fridge. No, you can not chill your own water either. Regardless of paying hundreds of dollars for the two rooms, you are not trusted with the minibar contents, and your room standards are decreased by removing the fridge.

For my second trip, Hotel G was slightly cheaper than the previous hotel, so I thought I'd give Hotel G a go.   Upon arrival, I didn't appreciate discovering that the airport shuttle bus could not drop me off at reception because the Hotel G car park is of low height.

Room was clean and well equipped, service was helpful and professional, breakfast was varied enough for us. One slight negative about breakfast was due to layout, because of the tables and chairs it meant the area to get food was limited, resulting in lots of shoving, bumping and waiting for others to pass. When you're tired and grumpy in the morning, this wasn't fun. A change in layput would help, but this is a restaurant, so can understand it would cause too much disruption.

Date of stay: April 2019,mekanoid,My new favourite boutique hotel,"Hotel G is a standout amongst Budget/mid-range hotels in central Singapore. As a frequent visitor / startup CEO I am progressively trying them all and I can promise you there are a few attributes of Hotel G that make it hard to beat.

1. It’s attitude and atmosphere is of a high end boutique hotel, prices are relatively low
2. The gym is high standard and better than expected
3. The bars and restaurants on level 1 are upmarket and create an incredible ambiance to enjoy or come home through - they also make for a convenient meeting place you can be proud of.
4. The lobby is funky and staff are professional
5. The room designs are intelligent, clean and space saving, bed is comfortable
6. The walls are thick, I’ve heard noise complaints at other properties and this was not the case here.

what was my surprise when reviewing the charges on my credit card, I see that there are almost € 4,000 in downloads of ituns that of course I have not done.
They are made just the same afternoon of our arrival, a few hours later, therefore I have no doubt that it was the staff that that afternoon was at the hotel reception who did it. The card was not used on that day, only who had access to it was the hotel because you have to deliver a credit card on arrival, which is taken away and the view peirdes for a while.
I have put the corresponding complaint in Spain, but this is unacceptable and more a country like Singapore that they say is one of the safest in the world. I have brought this to the travel agency to take action and not send more customers to that hotel, because in addition to this on arrival they tell me that they charge me three euros for a bar of the minibar that we do not consume, it is more It must be said that there is no minibar, only a few snaks on the table, because there is no place for a fridge and with the heat it makes, you have to drink the hot water.

The room was too tiny, no place for clothes, toilet too tiny and edge of the bed is located exactly at the wall. I am diabetic and need to pee a lot during the night. So I always need to wake up my partner to pass and jump from a very high bed. I'm lucky i did not break a leg during my stay.Everytime we need clothes we have to open the luggage alternately. In the morning is very hard to prepare at a tiny corridor and no place for make up and toiletries. Rainshower in a tiny cubicle makes the whole toilet and corridor wet. Everytime you shower there is no space to move and shower curtain keeps on being sucked by the ventilation towards  the person showering. My whole 3 days here was hell considering the size of luggage we have. The room was not so clean also that our first night i was itchy and can still smell the previous person who sleep in that bed.  There is no slipper provided and the floor was so cold (cement floor not carpeted). So i end up bringing 2 slippers I got from a previous hotel we stayed in. Lift was too slow and 1 is down, A lot to complain about but there are also good points. Restaurant downstairs was really nice, breakfast was good and quality food.

Date of stay: September 2018,lindsayinnz,"Clean, comfortable, good location, but I wouldn't stay again","There was nothing awful about Hotel G, but nothing amazing about it either.

The location was good - easy to walk to most places (about 10ish mins to Raffles Hotel, 25ish mins to Marina Bay/Gardens by the Bay) and really close to several subway stations.

The service was hit and miss - some people were nicer and more welcoming than others (the woman at breakfast was definitely on the less welcoming end of the scale). But then I came back one afternoon to find a little note with helpful tips on getting to the Grand Prix and a complimentary bottle of red wine. Pretty sure everyone got them, but I thought it was a nice touch.

Breakfast was fine - I didn't have any of the cooked egg options, but people seemed to be enjoying them. There was a good array of Asian and Western dishes, so whatever you wanted, you could probably find.

Gym was pretty good - small, but functional.

The rooms were fine. Bed was really comfortable, but to be honest, I found the 'modern' design of things really annoying. I only think that 'innovative' design should be used when it makes sense, not for the sake of it.

For instance, the light for the bathroom is next to the bed, rather than next to the bathroom. The shower was infuriating, as the rain shower head didn't work and so had to use the pull-out shower head, which was fine except it made the curtain blow straight on me, which made it impossible to shower. If I adjusted the shower head to stop the curtain from blowing on me, water went all over the bathroom floor. Also, the shower curtain seemed out of place - it was modern sliding glass everywhere else, why then have a curtain?!

And if you're travelling with someone who you would rather didn't hear your noises in the bathroom, this is not a good hotel for that because the bathroom door is a sliding glass door that doesn't fully seal.

I also couldn't for the life of me figure out how to put the do not disturb sign on - I didn't have a sign to hang on my door and there was a button outside that seemed to illuminate, but I couldn't find any way of illuminating it...nowhere. I searched everywhere. I just had to keep my fingers crossed that when I went to the gym in the morning I wouldn't come back to find housekeeping in my room.

The other kind of annoying thing is that reception is on the second floor, so you have to go through the bar, up a set of stairs, then take an elevator up one floor to check in. So if you can't/don't want to carry your luggage up a flight of stairs, don't bother. There also wasn't any clear signage about accessible entry to the reception, so if that's something you need, you may want to call to check whether it even exists.

The elevators were really slow, so it took a while to get in and out.

This place just didn't do it for me like it seemed to do for other reviewers. As I said, nothing terrible, but I wouldn't stay there again.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Toronto, Canada",116 ,76 ,3.0,

I really loved the 'big hotel facilities, small hotel friendliness' of the place. The rooms were narrow but very well-designed to make the most of every square centimetre of space. A built-in wardrobe had been sacrificed for more floor and desk space. A cool feature was the spotlit niche under the platform bed for stashing your suitcase. I took advantage of a brilliant corporate promotion that 'forced me' to be sociable as it included a complimentary glass of wine daily, as well as two pieces of free laundry. Smart marketing, because I ended up eating at the hotel with my son five nights out of my 13-night stay. The lovely bartenders Habil and Fi at Ginett (the hotel bar and French/rotisserie restaurant on Level 1) should be singled out for special mention. They recognised my son and I without fail, warmly welcomed us and made me feel 'at home' even when I was drinking and dining alone. The food is fabulous. My son, a carnivore, almost licked his steak plate (he had the ribeye with mash and pepper sauce). I loved the root vegetables and the great-value bar bites. The Beetroot Tartare and the various generous single portions of fresh cheese were delicious. Another brownie point was scored when my request for complimentary late check-out was accommodated (hotel policy was flexed on the basis of the length of my stay – a personal touch that I greatly appreciated).

Downstairs is a vibrant bar (can’t hear anything from the rooms, don’t worry)  The bar had a great cocktail and wine list, all very well priced. The cuisine is french, so are the wines.

There wasn't much room for luggage so be prepared if you are carrying big luggage- we only had carry on and put everything in an alcove under the bed and hung up clothes on the rails.

Only criticism is ventilation. Whenever we entered the room it smelt a bit mouldy and that is probably cos there was no where for the steam and moisture from the shower to go. The shower was small with a curtain so be prepared for it to touch you if you are a bigger person.

Date of stay: December 2017,TheOneTraveler,Modern and stylish hotel,"Booked a room for 3 days in beginning December 2017. The hotel located strategically in middle road, which is nearby Bugis junction. If you want to pray at Kwan Im temple in Bugis, then this hotel is perfect place. You just need to walk around 5 mins and you will get there. The building is modern and moderate size. First floor are restaurant and bar. The restaurant called Ginett wine and bar are both restaurant and bar. This place is hype and crowded in the night with youngster. Great place to hang out. Another restaurant is 25 degrees which is the place that you can have a decent burger. Despite of the hotel restaurant itself, it is only 5 mins to go to Albert food centre ( well known hawker center in Bugis, and also you could walk to the Bugis Junction. So food is not a problem. And also shopping.
The room itself, we booked what they called mystery room. Basically the interior designed to look alike detective room, which is kind of cool. we have single bed room for two person. while it is not that spacious but it is adequate and even can fit for 3 persons. They provide standard amenities such as coffee and tea set, 2 bottles of mineral water provided by Dr Who Singapore. The good things that the room has window and facing the street. And it has a smart tv, which can mirroring your android smartphone. So you could watch youtube or Netflix using this and thanks God that wifi is speedy here.
The bathroom is small. The shower separated by curtain with the toilet. There is no bidet and there is no wash basin. The wash basin is outside of the bathroom. They use Metis product from Australia for the soap and shampoo. And also good to mentioned that they provide a hairdryer.
The hotel has a gym, which is decorated nicely. It is located on the 3 rd floor. While it is not that big, but the toopl is adequate. I even has boxing bag. Also it is opened 24 hours by using your room card.
The lobby and the taxi stop located on the 2nd floor. It is small lobby but well decorated. The staff also attentive. You can hire taxi from them

You'll crawl over your sleeping partner every morning.  But, this is fine.  A larger room at a similar style of hotel will cost you considerably more.  My major concern had to do with the breakfast.  First of all, the breakfast offering was quite nice.  Without a doubt.  But, the space was incredibly unorganized and it seemed like the staffing could improve.  I'm not one to complain, but some mornings it was basically impossible to get a cup of coffee because the staff did not reset the coffee machine, or there were no cups, or some sort of easily remedied error.  It seemed as though the staff was not lacking in quantity, but rather in motivation and/or direction.  It was somewhat disappointing, because the was obviously considerable effort put into setting up a nice breakfast spread.

But here are a few hiccups:

First night - realised that the air-conditioning was malfunctioned and called the reception, problem was resolved 5 minutes later and we were switched rooms immediately. The next room was a little dusty and the floor was a little sticky, but it was 1.30am in the morning and we didn't make a fuss about it. It got cleaned the next morning.

There was some water leaking on the corridor to the new room. Initially thought it was due to rain but it didn't stop after 3 nights there.

I parked my car there and double checked on the parking rates - I got told that as long as I don't move my car, I will be charged a flat rate of $15/day. And so I left it there until I checked out of the hotel - Which I got told that I'm supposed to move the car on a daily basis so that I can reset and get the flat rate; Very confusing statements altogether. I wasn't told that I could pay the parking fees via credit card with the hotel, because I had then reloaded my CashCard on purpose to pay for it.

It sticks to your legs probably because of the exhaust/ventiallation.   Bed wasn’t so bad either just wished they had a better duvet. Had to ask for extra blanket because it was too thin.

They upgraded us upon check-in, and our room was comfortable, quiet and had more charm than most hotel rooms. We slept very well.   The burger bar and hotel restaurant are both very good; the burgers are fantastic and so was the luxurious brunch we had at the hotel restaurant in the morning. Service was very good, too.   Our only complaint was the inefficient check-out process. While check-in was seamless, we stood in line for 15 minutes in a packed and claustrophobic lobby to wait until we could hand in our keys and settle our tab. Too many people were checking in at the same time as people were checking in; the hotel should consider having a dedicated line for guests checking out to expedite that",,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",16 ,7 ,4.0,

Date of stay: September 2017,BeverleyBlue,Good Hotel But Room Ergonomics Let's It Down,"Good location and a very modern vibe to it, but the layout of our very small double room was poor. The double bed touched 3 of the walls and you had to climb over one another to get in an out. The light switches we're out of arm's length and the one for the sink area (outside the shower) was right by the door. All in all, it was a disaster of a room to use, with nowhere to store luggage and difficult to move around in without tripping over one another.  On the plus side, nice breakfast and handy location.  Don't be fooled by the kettle. It's actually a thermos flask you have to fill with hot water from the machine outside the room; again counterintuitive.

The downside bar and restaurant is definitely worth a try. We stayed there from Friday till Saturday and there was parties till midnight in the pub 25 degrees. It seemed like a prime spot of the surroundings. We not being truly party people loved the flow and stayed there till 1 am. One thing to note for all travelers to Singapore. It's very safe even at 4 am. We went for a stroll at garden by the bay at midnight and it was surreal. The next day we went to Clarke Quay at midnight for drinks.

The uber map shows the pick-up in front of the restaurant at ground level. I did not want to get picked-up there since I had luggage with me. Since I gave you the phone, I could very much feel your unwillingness to help me out through a combination of your disgusted facial expressions, cold tone, and wanting to hand back the phone to me as soon as possible.

There was no space for our luggage and no space to walk around the edge of the bed - as I slept by the window, I had to do some pretty fancy acrobatics to clamber over my partner when I needed to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Date of stay: April 2017,Sungoku77,Good quality cheap hotel,"First and foremost I recommend this place if you're on a budget and single traveler (couples might find it a little small for the basic room size). It was clean, AMAZING shower, great customer service and facilities and one of the best breakfast spreads I've had for this price range, hands down. The rooms are a little on the smaller side but functional and good for solo travelers or perhaps couples on a budget that don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room.
However, the biggest issue I had with this place was finding the entrance. There is a big sign out front with the hotel name and a whole first floor of restaurants entering from the sidewalk but no clear sign for the reception area. There is an entrance sign around the sign but this is only for the carpark along with a staff member entrance. Needless to say after 8 hours of flying, trying to find the entrance to get to your room is the last thing you want to do (btw it's through the restaurant up one level to the elevators that take you to the second floor).

Its a tiny bit confusing to locate the lobby as its inside a carpark and has no actual street frontage for the lobby. But dont let that put you off.

The staff are super friendly and very helpful. They will go out of their way to help in the best way they can. I asked for a room with a bigger bed and my request was promptly accepted.
The beds are wonderful. Lovely shower with such good water pressure. The rooms are standard for singapore. Small but intimate. It has this amazing little phone you can take out of your room for free called HANDY and it allows you to make free calls and texts and ever call overseas!
The breakfast was amazing! i cant believe how good it was! seriously!

Also by chance, I came across a very cool photography exhibition at a place called Objectifs just 1 block away, seems that the hotel is in the middle of the art district, loved it!
Room is rather on the small side but functional and the bed was really comfy. I did not feel like the room was missing anything, it just felt like being home with all the comfort I could ask for.
Just one thing I could complain about, I felt very cold in the room corridor...but would be happy to stay at Hotel G for my next trip!",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Bangkok, Thailand",67 ,11 ,5.0,
Date of stay: January 2017,Mimettis,Compact room with everything that's needed,"The location of the hotel was really good. Many MRT stations, Little India, CBD and Orchard Road are in good walking distance. Bus stop is right in front of the hotel. Rooms are compact but equipped with everything needed. Handy phone was awesome, free 4G internet always on the go!",Trip type: Travelled solo,Finland,2 ,,4.0,
Date of stay: February 2017,A Tripadvisor Member,Would not stay again,"Staff was a bit rude at the front desk. Rooms are extremely small, claustrophobic and characterless even for 1 person. Location is good as you are able to walk to most places. Walls are thin and you can hear the neighbours loud an clear.  If you want to smoke you need to go dow with the lift and walk away from the hotel as the surrounding areas are non-smoking. A bit too much effort and not friendly for smoking guests. I would say pick another hotel even if you have to splurge a little more because it will be worth it.",Trip type: Travelled solo,,110 ,67 ,2.0,
Date of stay: February 2017,EnvymeVanilla,Love the ambience and it accessories,"I checked in recently to visit a friend in Singapore. The hotel is centrally located and easy spotted. The hotel ambience is great with thoughtful design and decoration. The background of the reception is decorated with an abstract art and very welcoming.

The room size is good and I love the touch of bohemian from the dreamcatcher on the ceiling with overall lofty feeling of the room. Good for Instagram moment! The bed is comfier than I thought it would be. The working station is practical and enough space to actually do some work. The bathroom is functional and great shower amenities. I do like when the hotel is equipped with rain shower. The hotel also offer mirroring system. I can linked my iPhone to the TV and it worked! It was a relaxing moment watching Youtube on a TV screen instead of watching it from my phone while waited for a friend to pick me up.

Overall, I had a great time here and the designed of the hotel is awesome! I would definitely return.",Trip type: Travelled solo,Texas,99 ,8 ,5.0,
Date of stay: February 2017,eolopinion,Boutique feel and amazing restaurant,"Stayed at Hotel G for two nights while on business in Singapore. Booked a great room and even though rooms are a bit small they are very well laid down and cozy. Loved the fact that they are providing a free mobile phone for us to use while in town and that wi-fi is free and reliable. The beds and their dream catcher are a very nice touch. The highlight of our stay was they ambiance and the quality of the food at their restaurant Ginett, they have amazing wines and food and there is a very cool ambiance. Overall great experience and will definitely come back",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Shanghai, China",66 ,50 ,5.0,
