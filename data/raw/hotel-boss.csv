Our room had a great view and the air con in the rooms was strong. Also well located for delicious food around little India.  The rooms are TINY - there are no wardrobes, there is nowhere to store a bag that doesn‚Äôt obstruct the door.

We initially had a different hotel booked but we paid more to stay in this hotel for better proximity to things we wanted to do.  On check in, it was great they were able to check us in ahead of the usual check in time however my gratitude went sour when I was asked to complete a tripadvisor review on the spot and they would appear to NOT release my hotel keys until I had done it - what the?? I was also supposed to mention the staff's name but I didn't and she was very unimpressed with me. Sorry for that Vashanti, I've now mentioned you. I quickly deleted that review after I got my keys.

After some exploring, you are ready to hit the sack. You settle down for the night and enjoy the sounds of your fellow hotel travellers poo as it travels throughout the graphically noisy plumbing system. After recovering from the nauseating experience, you are treated to the sounds of your neighbours violently clearing their throats and raucously expelling it into the sink as you listen to it follow along on the journey of the recently travelled poo.

We stayed at room 1624 and Amirul helped us with check-in! The rooms however were I guess average. The doors dont shut fully to the floor which leaves a little gap which also means that noise from the outside can get really annoying when trying to sleep. Especially when the room is close to the elevators which means that the elevator ""dings"" and the footsteps and voices of other visitors are rather loud.  The view was very nice and the AC efficient allbeit a bit loud as well. The wifi was alright in the room, it did however disconnect us from time to time - but it reconnected rather quickly so it wasn't that much of an issue.

Date of stay: September 2023,ginny,Worst hotel experience I have ever had,"Stayed at this hotel for 1 night before we flew home. Wow where to start, Worst hotel I have stayed in ever. We knew the rooms would be small but they are like shoe boxes and are so basic and the walls are paper thin so you hear everything. The hotel is advertised as a mid range hotel, I have stayed in better travelodges

With the exception of the cleaning staff the staff at this hotel are rude and curt and grunt at you rather than actually engage in any conversation with you

The breakfast is poor and not great and feels like a school cafeteria with plastic plates and cups and signs up saying you will be charged for wastage.

Think this hotel is geared at the Asian market and is not even mid range. Given how much we paid for the 3 rooms I expected better

Think they need to send their staff on a Customer services course as they certainly don‚Äôt know how to interact with their guests",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Whitley Bay, United Kingdom",3 ,3 ,2.0,

Hotel location is very convenient as it is very near Lavender MRT station and also about 10-15 minutes walk from Little India. Room size was very small considering the price we paid per night, a little more than Rs.10,000/- per night ( Superior Double Room without breakfast). Also, the room had no almirah.
It is a very big hotel in Singapore. We were really surprised when we entered such a small room allotted to us in 7th floor. The bed was also uneven.
Plus points: Hotel reception gave additional bottled water on demand on most occasions. They had big locker room where you can put your luggage after checking out. Plenty of restaurants around the hotel and very near Mustafa centre where all items of daily necessities are available.
However, room size was a big disappointment. If you put your luggage for two persons in that room, without any almirah, there is hardly any space to walk in the room.

Date of stay: July 2023,Leec1502,"Dirty and noisy, avoid in my opinion","Avoid this place.

I don‚Äôt usually review somewhere before checking out. This is the 18th hotel we have used at the end of an 8 week trip, and it‚Äôs the worst.

I also note the majority of the 5 star reviews given to this place are by people with one contribution on Trip Advisor, so I‚Äôd doubt whether they are in fact genuine reviews.

I booked this place as it purports to use the SG Clean Quality Mark. It is far from it.

Check in was quick and we were allocated room 9-99. Apparently a superior room. As soon as we entered the room it smelled like someone had run around with a dirty mop. The seat in the room was dirty and there was dust around the floor edges.

We were moved to 7-99. Marginally better but still nowhere near a superior room. It is opposite where the housekeepers are. This means a housekeeping trolley partially blocking the corridor at all times (this would be a hazard in an emergency) Then early this morning the staff were very noisy outside our door. The door to their area constantly banging as they drag trolleys in and out to the service lift. Absolutely zero consideration to guests being able to relax and rest.

Both rooms were very basic and sparsely furnished. This superior room is apparently bigger than a standard room, and this one is small.

Rooms are also poorly insulated. So noisy from people above.

We just went down to breakfast and walked straight out. It was disgusting in there. Floors and tables were filthy and over run with people everywhere.

Tomorrow morning can‚Äôt come soon enough when we check out.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Palm Cove, Australia",125 ,102 ,,2.0

It seems that the staff came in to help clean the room while I was out of the room, so that I can return to the room at night to have a better experience, which also makes me feel very grateful. Finally, I also have some suggestions for the hotel. When I sleep at night, I will hear the sound of running water from the upstairs room, and there will be some noise, as well as the voices and other sounds in the corridor outside. If possible, I suggest that you can further improve the sound insulation. To sum up, I think I got a cost-effective stay in Hotel Boss.

Lastly, the location of this Hotel Boss is amazing - located in the heart of the city, travelling out to different parts of Singapore has never been faster! Literally, the bus stop right outside of its doorstep has so many bus services that brings you to so many different parts of Singapore without having to change bus - how convenient?! Also, you could literally walk to Bugis (6mins) or even Chinatown (10mins) in just one straight path!

Amazing location with amazing food bistros, restaurants and cafes and amazing city view of Singapore!

No where to sit guests having to stand and eat. Staff were working hard to clear tables but there were nowhere near enough staff and no manager presence to oversee what was occuring. It was the worst experience we have ever had for a breakfast and food was basic and same each day. On the day of leaving 2nd June  we called for our bags to be collected waited 45 mins rang three times and no one came for over 1 hour . We ended up having to bring them down ourselves to see the bell boys all standing around.  The queue at the reception was so long could not even get to the desk.

1) Price with this Room was SMALL but CLEAN with window.
2) So far stay was quiet stay at night, not wake up by next door guests; but still can heard very clear when other guests pass by the corridor outside the rooms.
3) Bus station at door step from the hotel lobby and also near Lavender MRT Station (6 mins walk) + McDonald just along the road. There is Convenient Store next to hotel lobby. Many of Cafe, Restaurants & Bar nearby if you don't mind to take few minutes walk.
4) Hotel's Caf√© (Breakfast serve HALAL & Non-Halal foods)
5) No Commend on the swimming pool & gym room as i am not using for it.
6) toiletries, hair dryer provided, pressure of the water also good (Hot & cold water function well) and fit your basic need daily used.

* Bear in mind DON'T Expect spacious room as per many of country in Singapore.

Disliked ~
1) Even thought switch on all the lights of the room still feel a little bit dark in the room. Probably management can consider to change one or two lights to white light instead of warm yellow lights to fit the guest preference.
2) Feel hot in the room at night as the air-conditioner in the room was set lower temperature set at 21c with the hot weather during this couple of months.
3) Visited during Raya Festival, not so comfortable with 75% of the hotel guests mostly is from India/Arab/Malay.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",85 ,9 ,,3.0
Date of stay: May 2023,Teh Y,Average hotel,"The things that I üòÉ
Here has a grand and spacious lobby, always filled with guesses. The staff are friendly and hospitality, fast check-in speed. Have room cleaning daily. This hotel is 2-3 mins walking distance to the green line Lavender mrt (can direct go to Changi airport) and about 10 mins to the blue line Jalan Besar mrt station. Quite convenience to access public transportation via bus and MRT. Nearby the hotel has Cheer convenience store, money changer, fruits stall, restaurants etc. They have a mini gym room and a decent size of swimming pool at the 4th floor, can bring your kids to swim at here. The laundry (washer and dryer and iron board) are located at this floor as well. It is S$5 for the washer and the dryer respectively, and S$1 for the detergent. Iron is FOC. The lift access required card, so only guest can access to it and I like this security set-up.

The things that I üôÅ
We suspect is due to the wood hanger or maybe the cloth using by the housekeeper is not clean, the room always has an unpleasant smell after we came back with the housekeeping done.
The room and the bathroom is pretty small, I barely can extend my arms in the shower room.
The foods in the cafe is average, not really a wide choice of foods variety. And the taste if the foods really need to be improved‚Ä¶ especially the vege dish, I ate a broccoli that still in frozen! However, I like their fish/chicken congee very much! It is the best food among all the choices. The sitting arrangement in the cafe is quite packed. I have difficulty to stand up if there is someone sit behind me. And some of the air-cond vent sin the cafe has water leaking! What a shame. I notice one of it is located on top of one of the food! Imagine the food that we eat contained with the air-cond leaking water‚Ä¶ ü§¢",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Klang, Malaysia",26 ,1 ,,3.0

Date of stay: February 2023,Jeffsreview,In a good location but the hotel is getting tired and is in need of refurbishment,"The Hotel BOSS in Singapore is a modern looking from the outside but Certainly shows its age in the rooms and corridors. This hotel¬† like many hotels in Singapore are heavily overpriced for what you get, and that is certainly the case when it comes to this hotel.

The foyer is large and lavish, but when you check into the rooms they're extremely small and compact, with old dated fecor and furnishings, and it has very little to offer.¬†

This hotel is very basic.

There is very little room to put anything and they provide a safe, tea and coffee making facilities, a small bar fridge, and a very small, very outdated TV with an extremely poor selection of channels. You cant watch your own movies or anything on it due to it being A very old outdated TV.

The air conditioning is poor and it is locked on a set of 2Ôæü up or down which is ridiculous because it hardly makes any difference and yet they're charging you top dollar, it simply is not worth it

The bathroom is very small and the shower is so small it is ridiculous no matter which way you stand in the shower you can touch both walls without even trying to move your arms outwards. A very large person simply would not be able to use the shower. The water pressure is average and could be a lot better.

There is 1 small tube of body wash and 1 of shampoo and a tiny bar of soap.¬†

They do not provide hand towels or face washers.¬†

They do not provide bathrobes or slippers.

The Wi-Fi is absolutely terrible and drops up all of the time and is very poor quality.

The beds are very firm and Not very comfortable, and they only provide 2 pillows for a double bed.

The hotel is OK for one night if you have to do a stop here due to connecting to flights the next day, but otherwise it's really very overpriced, it needs a lot of updating improvements to make it worth the excesive high prices that they charge. I have stayed in backpackers that are better equipped than this hotel.

I wouldn't recommend the hotel because it needs a major refurbishment and I have to Yeah stop being so tight and penny pinching so people can make the air conditioning to suit their comfort, and they should have replaced these old tvs which should have been replaced 10 or 15 years ago. Definitely not worth the price.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",957 ,216 ,,2.0

We arrived at the hotel via Grand Hyatt airport transfer and check-in process was a breeze. We were brought to our suite by a Barbie Ambassador. Our room view was amazing with a full view of the Petronas Twin Tower. The room was beautifully decorated and clean. My daughter was jumping with delight seeing all the Barbie decor right from the lobby at lvl 33 and more Barbie decor in our suite, lol. We also had our high tea at the Barbie Cafe which is again, beautifully decorated. We had an amazing time at the staycation and very impressed with Grand Hyatt's impeccable service.

Date of stay: December 2022,staycationbeary,Horrendous experience! ,"No words could really express our horrendous experience. Booked a Superior Room with balcony there during Xmas. The room was small and rather dirty. TV only has local channels but the network was extremely bad so it couldn't display the show smoothly - often lags, take a long time to load or it blacks out all of a sudden. Everything feels cheap and of poor quality. Soundproof is basically non-existent as well - could literally hear the conversation and footsteps outside or beside the room.

The funny thing is that the room's balcony is facing inward so there's no view to look at except for staring at your fellow neighbours. Definitely not worth the top up unless you book the Premier Room with balcony.

Service by the check-in counter staff was subpar, at best. The Trainee did not seem too pleased to be working on a public holiday.

The worst part of all was that the counter staff (not sure whether it was the same guy though) issued another guest the same room even though I've already settled into the room for >1hr! Came to find out when someone knocked and tried to open the door. We were both shocked how could this error be made in the first place. In the end the other guest had to go back down to the counter and inform the staff about this error. An absolute breach of safety and privacy. Couldn't help but to think throughout the whole stay what if someone else tries to enter my room again.

Overall, they certainly do not deserve to be categorised as a 4-star hotel and definitely not even a 3-star hotel. Money is better spent at other hotels instead.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",21 ,12 ,1.0,

Date of stay: August 2022,Aiden D,AVOID this place at all costs. Hotel Boss is dodgy!,"I would have to say that this was the WORST hotel I've ever stayed in.

Firstly, the room was not as outlined or pictured within the initial online booking. The room was crammed, dirty and not what we thought we had paid for. Nonetheless, it continued to worsen throughout our trip.

The bed was uncomfortable, like horrific. Topped off with the ridiculous amounts of noise - screeching chairs in the above rooms, yelling in the foyers etc., it was phenomenal how you could get such a terrible sleep whilst on a relaxing holiday.

The outdoors area was lovely, until you go for a swim. You will immerse yourself in the dirty pool with a considerable amount of debris. Just be careful, as you may step on a glass that's living at the bottom of pool.

We spoke to the staff at the counter and addressed these issues, many of which were brushed off and the attitude from them was appalling. There were other customers who were also complaining about the experience at Hotel Boss. We then made the decision to leave our stay early and re-booked at another hotel so we could get adequate sleep.

In addition, it seems to be standard practice to allow guests to sleep barefooted on the foyer. It is disgusting and was an awful entrance to the hotel in which we thought we'd thoroughly enjoy.

We issued a chargeback through our bank, however, Hotel Boss declined this and cancelled this chargeback all together. It was dodgy, and it is clear that Hotel Boss is more interested in profiting from poor people who choose to stay at their establishment.

Whilst the photos make the place look nice - don't be fooled, it is not worth it at all. It is disgusting, dirty and management is horrific.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,1 helpful vote,,1.0,

The breakfast buffet was awful.. the floor was very wet and sticky, the food wasn't edible and there is a sign that states 'there is a $5/100gms surcharge if you leave food on your plate'. Very hard to avoid when the food is awful.

the third one - watch for the hanger on the pictures - rooms are so small that there is no space for wardrobes.
put requests - no one even bothered to get back.

and you can forget to seat there normally - there is no space to put your leg - shower glass is next to the toilet.
if the room is not facing city, your window is 2 meters from another glass wall like in prison and in reflection you are not just seeing yourself but all your neighbours and what they do in addition of others not closing their blinds!!! :) on opposite side.

We got 4 rooms cause we are 16 pax, it's just a shame that the family room is not on the same floor as the 3 rooms because they said that there is only one family room per floor.

What I don't like is that they only clean the rooms once a week (but i'm not reaaly that sure if it is once a week only) because we stayed there for 3 nights and 3 days we thought that everyday they will clean the rooms. We got 4 rooms cause we are 16 pax. Although when i ask the front desk about it they said their schedule and if we want to ask for anything, they could give us like(bottled water, towels,etc.) and the night before we checked out someone talked to me at the lobby and his a foreigner also and staying at the hotel, he asked me if i wanted to give him a massage in his room. I got scared and goes back to our room fast. I didn't report to the receptionist cause i got scared.

I went to the 4th floor to see the swimming pool (when we checked in, i ask if until what time does the pool open, they said only 9pm ) but when i arrived there are some people having a night swimming even though it is past 9, i think that they should check on that.",,"Mabalacat, Philippines",3 ,,,3.0

Date of stay: February 2021,Ila Py,"Good price with pool, gym and restaurants (including halal ones)","Stayed with family in two rooms which were, quite frankly, tiny but functional - small fridge, big windows, area to hang clothes and accommodate small luggages, desk and some drawers, one side table with storage space underneath etc Bathrooms were small too but it has adequate space for shower cabin, shelf for toiletries, sink with adequate space for other toiletries and makeup stuff ( very important for ladies). Ironing facilities are provided in a separate place. The only reason why I‚Äôm deducting one star is the room size - if you come with large luggages, as people normally do when travelling Asia, you might want to consider a much bigger than their standard room which will cost more I imagine. Even then, it feels rather stuffy because of the very little space in which to manoeuvre. Regardless, Everything looks reasonably clean and well-maintained.

I‚Äôve given them the 4 stars because they are situated in an excellent area with lots of eateries for different budgets and preferences: pizzas, Korean chicken wings, durian restaurant, Chinese food court including vegetarian stall, Malay mixed rice, Arab food, Indonesian nasi padang or Indian food like briyani/sup kambing/mutton chop, dim sum restaurant, Japanese ramen restaurant, and many many more. Close to Bugis for shopping;, I like to go to their Uniqlo outlet as there are lots of stuff on sale. Oh it‚Äôs close to the Sultan mosque so many restaurants in the area are certified halal as is one of the restaurants in which you have your breakfast in the hotel (if it‚Äôs in your package) but just go out and find breakfast, eat like a local - kingly and your stomach, a bottomless pit.

There‚Äôs a good sized pool and a gym, short walk from lavender MRT which is close to the airport. Hurray! considering the price we paid for the room; a bargain

The staff are very professional, warm and friendly, who I must say, are rather flexible in their approach rather than sticklers for rules (that‚Äôs a huge plus, am I right?)- they let us check in much earlier and check out later than expected. Made it easy for me to check in for my brother even though he wasn‚Äôt there using a photo of his IC etc. I mean, they were all cool; every single one i‚Äôve met, including the ones checking our temperatures ( this was during covid) it feels rather ‚Äúhomey‚Äù

I recommend this place if you are planning to stay short term and don‚Äôt have a lot with you (or get a bigger room), especially if you just want to enjoy food with your partner or the facilities, just don‚Äôt expect to watch good stuff on TV. (TV channels suck big time) WiFi in our room was ok as was the thermostat. Good water pressure. Corridor can be quite noisy but generally people are respectful. But if you come during covid period, there is a limit on the number of people allowed in the pool premises + max 1 hour only, FYI.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",56 ,16 ,,4.0

Date of stay: February 2021,Toothless,Modern Hotel in a Great Location with Great Service,"Hotel Boss is about the location. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and Lavender MRT Station is 200m away. Bugis and City Hall area is a short bus ride away and Kampong Glam is within walking distance. Check-in was surprisingly quick, given the long queues inside the lobby as well as 2 separate long queues outside the hotel (one along its drop-off point via Syed Alwi Road and another along its front - Victoria Street). The staff were friendly and welcoming. Pretty good attitude given the large crowd and check-ins.

It's a mid-range hotel with many rooms. The rooms, however, are pretty small. Tiny, I would say. I have got a Triple Room and the distance between the foot of the bed and the desk is about a person's width. The en-suite toilet is tiny too. A big-sized guy like me would hit the wall or the basin when I changed inside the toilet. There are no traditional toilet paper dispenser. Instead, what was installed was a tissue paper in a cylindrical container where you pulled down piece by piece. This was installed by the mirror behind you if you used the bowl, so it was pretty inconvenient. The water strength of the tap and showers were good. Toiletries and towels were provided and replenished/changed daily.

The bed was comfortable but only one pillow was provided and the pillow was thin. The air-con is pretty strong and given the small size of the rooms, the room was cooled pretty quickly. There is no wardrobe but an open-style hanging system was used with 6 hangers. Coffee and tea was provided as well as a kettle. The mini-fridge was great! The strength was great and chilled my drinks quickly.

One really bad thing about Hotel Boss is that they have pretty thin walls. I could hear the muffled sounds of my next-door neighbours talking and the sound of the TV. There were some shouting two doors down and that was audible. Had to call the staff up to handle and they did a pretty good job. The in-room telephone wasn't working well and I could not hear anything after 2 calls down to the reception but they sent a guy up after that to make sure things were good.

Breakfast was provided and served at their 4th floor Halal-certified restaurant. It was a choice between a Chinese or Western set. Serving was great with the typical breakfast items, in addition to yogurt, bread and cereal with milk. There were queues at certain times of breakfast (after 9.30am) but that was probably due to the high occupancy rate.

All in all, I believe the Triple Room I stayed in was too cosy for 3 adults. I loved the service and condition of the room. It was convenient to get to a lot of places. However, one thing to note is that they would locked the front doors (facing Victoria Street) from 9pm-5am and you would have to access via its drop-off point (facing Syed Alwi Road and Kallang River).",,"Singapore, Singapore",356 ,62 ,,4.0

Date of stay: January 2021,MrLim,A thorough review on my 3 day 2 nights at Hotel Boss (room with balcony),"Today is my last day of my staycation at hotel boss and i think i shall give my thoughts on this hotel. I booked the room with the balcony and my room is on the 14 floor. The view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion (FYI: the balcony have no privacy at all so PLEASE do not be in your birthday suit). Jokes aside, when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem. The cleanliness of the room i‚Äôd say is 4.5/5. The bed is decent size and comes with 2 pillow total one for me and one for my GF. On the second day we decided to ask for 2 more pillow and when we ask the counter for pillow, i was greeted with a kind gentleman that promptly asked me for my room number and told me that he will send his staff up and true enough 5 minutes later my room door rang and i was greeted with a staff with 2 pillow. We ate at Papasan 17 located at the first floor of the hotel, the food portion and prices of the food were great. Taste wise it is decent. We visited famous food places close to the hotel such as golden mile food center and Jalan sultan prawn noodles and went to places such as Bugis and Clark Quay. Overall i didnt had much interaction with the staff but i had a rather decent experience here for the price. The few cons i had about this place is the lack of discipline the staff have towards the noise that is generated by other guests. Due to the thin wall, every noise that produce by the next room can literally be heard very clearly. The room beside us is blasting music at 2:41am and it is rather annoying as we are trying to get some rest to wake up early tomorrow morning to check out. Overall i will rate the experience here a 4/5.

Date of stay: December 2020,weijun,Staycation : Pleasant experience but swimming pool system needs improvement,"My family went on a one night staycation on 19 Dec. The lobby was nice but the room was really small. But still clean in general, except for a few ants crawling around on the table. We were served by Fiona and Lionel at the lobby upon registration. They were very friendly and helpful. They made us felt warmly welcomed and answered all our enquiries regarding our stay.
I was pleased with the accommodation and food, however, i was very upset and disappointed by the swimming pool queueing system. We had staycations at other hotels before and the swimming pool slots were assigned and we just had to come down to the pool during our assigned timeslot. For Hotel Boss, we had to rush down to queue in our swimming wear as it was based on first come first serve system. My husband brought my 4 years old girl down first and they managed to get into the pool. My 2 years old child and I arrived 10minutes later as she had to poo and change into her swimming suit etc. We were denied access to the pool and we had to queue up in our swim wear under the strong wind at the pool.
My brother in law and his wife offered to exit the pool in exchange for us to go in. This request was also being rejected at first. My 2 years old girl was so excited to go in and i had a hard time trying to coax her to be patient.
When we were finally allowed access to the pool, I was swimming with stress as there was a long queue of people in their swim wear. They looked so poor thing having to stand and queue for so long. We do not even know how long we had to queue or how many people were there already in the queue before we came down. This is such a silly system, inconsiderate of the wellbeing of customers. I sincerely hope that the management can review the system and make some improvements to create a better experience for all in future.",,,3 ,2 ,3.0,

Room is really small but if you're staying alone its acceptable. Room has a smell (not quite sure what it is, maybe a cigarette smell? but unlikely as hotel is a non smoking place). I was looking forward to a cable channel but was disappointed when I was told that at this time no cable channels (when I was really looking forward to watch all cable channels available)  Internet connection is rubbish , I had to call twice! (3rd time I was able to fix it myself) for someone to fix it as I cannot watch tv (otherwise local channels) as Youtube is directly connected on tv. Room service isn't that good too, I need to do a follow up call a few time as time had passed already and I still don't received my request. And another thing no iron inside the room you need to go to the 4th level to do it and your laundry as well (if you need it). Public transport is convenient too bus stop literally in front of the hotel and mrt is just a few minutes walk.

We were checked in by Hidayah who was friendly despite being swamped with a super long queue at check in. We got two rooms a triple and a superior double. very ample for a family or three children aged 13, 11 and 5.

Hotel itself was clean. facilities like the swimming pool was as well. Safe distancing measures was up. Only downside was that the the double room reeked of cigarette smoke. We mentioned it to the housekeeping staff who immediately applied some chemicals to the air con. Smell improved. But still gave non smokers like us a headache. The hotel did have reminders placed for no smoking but some previous guests are less than thoughtful.

We checked out early at 11 and had a family outing and reached home only at 10pm when I had realised that we had left our ipad at Hotel Boss.

This is our 3rd time staying in your wonderful establishment. All our stays has been very satisfying and extremely pleasant. Your staff with their high attentiveness and diligence have been simply outstanding. Special mention to Duty Manager Ryan for his attention to details and his proactiveness to always go out of his way to make us feel welcome and at home. Exhibited diligence, dedication and commitment.
Not forgetting all his front office staff who were equally outstanding and dedicated. Needless to say, housekeeping was equally prompt with their service. Rooms were always well and neatly maintained.
Pool area was excellent. Well maintained, huge, organized and clean. AMAZING!!!!!!
The service which we have received has been exceptional on every stay. We will definitely recommend this hotel to all our family and friends.
My wife and myself both agreed that we would rather stay in your hotel than any other 5 Star rated hotel.
Thank you once again for such a lovely and memorable stay.
Please convey our heartfelt thanks to all your staff.

Date of stay: October 2020,Krubee,A comforting and peaceful 2 nights retreat,"I've stayed at Hotel Boss several times before and so far I have enjoyed my stays. This time around I've decided once more to try a 2 nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place. This hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels  to book whenever I have loved ones visiting. Firstly, the price is right on the spot for a 4 star hotel which is not too expensive. I booked their promo for 2 nights which costs me only 188 SGD including tax. Secondly, I personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but I missed the Gloria Jean's coffee right inside it. Their restaurant at the lobby is also closed. Check-in is quite fast as there is no line and my room is quite spacious. It has a comfortable Queen size bed, complimentary water/tea/coffee and toiletries provided. Slippers you could request if needed. The room is very clean, neat and tidy when I arrived. Since they have centralized air-conditioning the room's temperature is very pleasant. Complimentary WIFI is quite fast and easy to connect. Their TV only has local channels but I was about to see some Korean, Australian, Indonesian channels as well but since it's a Smart TV you could also watch via Youtube or browse the internet on it. The cream of the crop in my room is the view - with their huge window I have a full panoramic view of the CBD on my right and Singapore Stadium/Kallang river on my left.  It is indeed spectacular when I wake up in the morning I see the sunrise, then the sunset in the afternoon and finally the beautifully lit buildings of the CBD at night. The toilet is also wonderful, spacious, clean and I personally loved their flooring. It gets dry easily, not too slippery and looks clean all the time. The water pressure and temperature is also easy to adjust and control. They have a pool and gym on the 4th floor which is also huge and have a great 360 view of the CBD around it. The restaurant at the 4F is also open. Finally, their central location is the best! It is indeed just right outside Lavender MRT and just few mins away from Orchard, CBD and even the east - Jewel/Changi or the west central area around Sentosa/Vivo. And just outside the hotel is the beautiful Kallang river park and lots of restaurants,  convenience stores, shops and food stalls just beside the Lavender MRT station. It is truly memorable for me every time I book Hotel Boss, it brings back my memories when I'm with my loved ones before. I will surely go back whenever I need to relax and rejuvenate at this amazing and wonderful hotel!!!",,"Singapore, Singapore",587 ,310 ,,5.0
Date of stay: October 2020,Keyis M,"Clean, Near to train station but horrendous guest eperience","No doubt that the location of the hotel is accessible. 200m away from the train station and buses available a step away from the hotel entrance. It is easy to get food and there is tons of options.to get food delivery around the area.

Room is pretty small but suffice for a night rest away from hotel and work destress.

However, checking in was horrendous.
I am appalled by the service that were given by the concierge service.
Zero empathy.

This is how the checking in was like :

Front Desk : What can I help you with?
Me : Hi good afternoon to you, I will like to check in please
FD : Do you make booking?
Me : Yes, this is my booking itinerary and heres my identification
Me : If its possible can I request for a room with balcony if available
FD : Yes, 20$ extra.
Me : Oh, then its ok I will stick with the initial room
FD : Ok
FD : Give the keycard to me, lobby is on your left.

Date of stay: October 2020,Wen Kang T,Disappointed,"Booked with Hotel Boss for a staycation in the month of October via Agoda. We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in.
The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users.

We stayed in another room the previous night, and we checked out and check in again early at 12:40pm, and the staff told us there were no rooms available, and insisted us to wait until 2pm before checking in. We said okay. However when we came back at 2pm, reminded that we booked for a city view, to have high floor, the staff Zin insist that there was no more high floor unit and gave us a 6th floor unit. We were disappointed when we went to the room, it was facing another HDB block and there was no privacy at all. We went straight down and asked nicely for a better unit, in which Andy was extremely quick in getting up to pace with the situation, and rectified it by giving us what we paid for in the very first place, a room with city view. As we will be staying for another 4 more nights, we are grateful for Andy and his quick assistance in recovering our trust with Hotel Boss‚Äôs service.

Date of stay: July 2019,Kushal2687,Small rooms but surprisingly efficient,"What is it with hotels in Singapore having extremely cramped rooms?
My room was a standard twin bed. There was no space to move after placing two large bags of my friend and mine. The room had a window which was as good as nothing. Anyways- my review will not be based on the room‚Äôs size as it‚Äôs a common trend in most of the hotels in Singapore. These kind of hotels are good to come back to only sleep, after having spent most of the day exploring the city.

Room- apart from the description above the room had paper thin walls. You would be comfortable to use the bathroom only if you know your room-mate well! The bathroom was surprisingly spacious enough to do your morning duties and have a shower too. I chose this hotel over others as the shower area was separated by a glass wall.
The room was basic but very clean. The staff did a good job of maintaining the rooms and hotel spaces- pleasantly surprised considering the massive number of rooms in every floor.

The hotel was packed in the season we travelled in. But the check-in process was fairly quick. Staff was helpful. I would expect such a place to be chaotic with the number of guests checking in and out at the same time but it wasn‚Äôt the case.
They have two restaurants serving breakfast- you need to select one at the time of booking based on your diet preferences. I managed to try both- the menu is limited but fresh. I would suggest to eat there solely to get you going in the morning.
The swimming pool was spacious and clean, and so was the terrace area. The hotel is located 5mins away from the nearest metro station and is a quick 30 min ride from the airport.",,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",694 ,133 ,,4.0

We stayed here for three nights while travelling through Asia and this was by far the most expensive hotel, purely because of the location however! Worth spending a bit more money and staying elsewhere.

Pros
Location not too bad - 10-15 min walk to nearest metro station.
Has a gym although very limited.
Large swimming pool

Cons
No offer to help carrying our heavy bags up to the room. Seemed to be self service form the start!
First room was near the lifts and extremely noisy - despite specifically requesting a quiet room. No excuse for this, plenty of empty rooms in a hotel if this size especially given current affairs. Basic customer service.
Safety deposit box did not work in the first room
Duvet cover torn
Moved to a second room further away from lifts which was much quieter.
Only one pillow per person - worst pillow we‚Äôve had during our 3 months travelling around SE Asia. Again, not hard to get right.
Only two large towels in bathroom, no smaller hand towels. Towels also had a very odd smell, in both rooms. Didn‚Äôt seem very clean.
Tissue dispenser out of reach of toilet and very low quality tissues.
Noisy air con in room
Not enough sun loungers

Bathrooms was basic, maybe consider having a bidet?

There was an issue with the flush of the toilet in my room but the housekeeping responded promptly and I was given another room on a higher floor which was bigger and had a balcony with a nice view of Singapore.    The breakfast was not bad, a buffet offering Asian and continental options. The place can get quite crowdy and squeezy as the hotel is big with lots of guests. I had a dinner at the Tocha Bistro, in the same building at the ground level out of the lobby, which was included in the room price as well. But there are many other small restaurants around.

Date of stay: December 2019,J0lly_J0hn,Upgrade to Premier if staying.  ,"The hotel is situated near the Little India part of Singapore. We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. We took notice of the reviews before we went and upgraded to a premier room so that we had a reasonable space to stay in. I can confirm that the cheaper rooms are very small. We had very little interaction with the staff, but those we sought assistance from, were very helpful. The 18th floor room provided spectacular views of Singapore.

We found the room quite nice, the furniture was of a good standard, and the bathroom was acceptable. Everything was clean. Again, having read the reviews we stayed well clear of the restaurant and found many cheap local places quite close by with good quality food at very reasonable prices. For example, we paid 4.00 Singapore dollars for duck in sauce and fried rice which was a good portion size.

It is quite a way to walk to Orchard Road but there is an MRT station within 200m of the property. We found the MRT system to be an inexpensive way to get around Singapore. The average cost of a single ticket was about 1.70 Singapore dollars. There are also plenty of buses that stop just outside the hotel.

Overall, the hotel is a good business style modern hotel with reasonable amenities. The lobby tends to get very crowded, but we found upgrading the room was to our advantage.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Gloucester, United Kingdom",113 ,125 ,4.0,

As this was our first time staying at this hotel, I was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel is located near to Lavender MRT, proximity to food and shops. The moment we arrived, staff greeted us and took care of our bags while we checked in. The lobby area is extremely spacious with plenty of comfortable sofas to sit on.The reception staff are very efficient and helpful.  There were a few minor things. When we booked our rooms, we didn't realized our room on the 18th Floor Block B was facing another grey building. The corridors carry sound very easily and guests are often not very considerate.  One night we had to call the reception to complain about the guests next to our room talking so loudly at around 1:20am. The walls are very thin, when the cleaning staff cleaned the other room, pulling out the beds and pushing the bed back, it hits against the walls and the banging noise was so loud that my bed shook. The third time it happened I managed to inform the cleaning staff about this.  We had breakfast at Papasan, could be better variety. Found 1 lady staff specifically to be rude when telling the guests that they cannot take away food from the restaurant. Need signage - ""No take away food"" allowed. Lastly, the laundromat was a blessing. You pay $5 for a load of washing and S$5 for dryer. It comes with liquid detergent. You can even do ironing.

Date of stay: December 2019,chocolatygudness,Great value!,"We booked this place on a rather last minute basis as our air bnb cancelled on us at the 11th hour!! Thankfully, Agoda was running some specials and had a voucher applied to our booking.

We stayed here during Christmas period (7 days). I want sure what to expect add we really didn't have much time to research. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel being a fantastic choice. It's SO convenient - access to MRT, proximity to food and with many choices available. I would come back here in a heartbeat.

The moment we arrived, staff greeted us and took care of it bags while we checked in. The lobby area is extremely spacious with plenty of comfortable sofas to sit on whilst waiting to be served or for a taxi ride.

The reception staff are super efficient and helpful. The hotel is fully serviced and it's clean. Very important to me!

No complaint about this hotel other than a few minor things. When we booked our rooms, there was an option of selecting adjoining rooms and quiet rooms. We didn't seem to get any of those options in which case, the hotel should have mentioned in either the booking confirmation or in arrival. Instead we received rooms adjacent to one another (that's fine). The noise however was a fault. The corridors carry sound very easily and guests are often not very considerate.
Also, internet was in and out. Mostly steady.

Whilst there was the ability to sync your device's YouTube with the tv, I did have trouble with that despite following all the instructions. We were able to use the inbuilt functionality of the TV to watch YouTube on the TV. The sound levels in the tv was not great though. It was soft and perhaps that was by design since it seems that the hotel isn't as soundproof as it could potentially be.

All in. This does not put me off coming back here again.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Perth, Australia",16 ,22 ,4.0,

She made sure that our stay was comfortable. We were celebrating our younger daughter's birthday and she surprised her with a gift and handwritten card which was a nice touch to our celebration. She & her colleagues made sure we meet our tour guide in lobby and our stay was comfortable.
Hotel location is good & safe, closer to shopping places (Mustafa center, the 24 Hr super store is 5 minutes away) and just a 5 minutes walk to MRT and about 20 minutes to the airport (during non-peak hours). Hotel does have nice restaurants but I never got a chance to eat as we would always come back late night. For breakfast you have options of Indian, Oriental and Continental options (you have to inform a day before if you want to switch the restaurant). Breakfast spread was good.
Hotel is always busy and the lobby is always filled with tourists so could get noisy.
You can always get a cab, any time of the day.
Rooms are fine, and have option of having 2 Adults + 2 kids (below 12) with 2 Queen size beds. Not very specious but comes with a balcony (Not suitable for kids under 6)
Since we use the hotel only for sleeping it worked out very well for us. The room service was prompt and did excellent job in keeping the room clean and tidy.

Date of stay: December 2019,sglayla,Not steady management ,"Relatively a cheap hotel with satisfactory amenities & facilities. Booked the hotel for our visitors on their last night in SG because it‚Äôs nearer to the airport for their early flight. Quite large property, 2 separate lift lobbies with many elevators which are efficient & rapid without a long wait. Relatively convenient location to town and many attraction spots, & easy access to Changi airport as well. Many busses stop right at the hotel (there‚Äôs a busstop facing the hotel lobby at street level). Mrt (metro) is not far either.
Check-in/reception counter had more staffs than it‚Äôs needed which made it look rather much chaotic. Too many trainees at one screen (3 or more & they engage in chats) & those trainees need to learn at least to smile & great the guests. Luggage handling at the lobby level is somewhat lacking, no assistance offered upon arriving in by taxi with many luggages. Had to go to him directly to request for his help. Our observation is that the management is poor & room maintenance is lacking.
Good varieties of room service menu & were quite cheap. Despite being relatively a new property but room fridge temperature control knob is already missing & aircon makes a lot of noise. Smaller rooms are quite a norm in a metropolitan cities like SG, HK & Tokyo etc. but very tiny bathroom. If you are a bigger built guy, would struggle in the bathroom.
Premier Queen room is 18sqm in size compared to their Superior room 14sqm & had only 1 tea cup? Had to request for another for double occupancy room. What was their housekeeping thinking? No one checks or evaluate their performance or just simply lacking standard?
Kids playground & Outdoor pool is located on level 4. The poll operates between 7am -9pm. Very poorly lit after dark but ppl still use the facility or at least leisurely lay on the bench/sun lounger after 9pm & some young caucasian guests were drunk and rude with vulgarities hurling to those around (family with very small children) which was super annoying & beyond what we have ever experienced at any hotel facilities ever before. Could have called in the Police to report for public nuisance which is an offence under Penal Code 290 in Singapore but we had very early flight to catch the next morning & children were quite tired. No security or hotel personnel is seen near by at all in case of any incidents or for simply a sense of safetiness (yes, were aware of the ‚Äúno safeguards on duty‚Äù announcement on wall).
Overall, the management needs to learn to allocate right number of staffs and people where it‚Äôs needed, learn to handle the crowd/big number of guests like they do in not only an efficient but also a safe & comfortable way, after-all its a hotel & those are equally important.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",15 ,22 ,3.0,

Date of stay: November 2019,Craig M,If you like tiny...then the rooms in this hotel might be for you!,"OK...well let's start with the good.
Staff here were excellent in every instance. Greeted by a porter who was very pleasant and brought our bags to the room. The front desk staff on arrival were very helpful and very nice. and when we were leaving they happily held our bags for us so we could head out and explore the city prior to our flights.
Hotel quality was very good, beds quite comfortable and bathroom modern and clean.
Location was excellent...for us anyway. There is a bus stop across the road which will take you to Merlion Park and other sort after areas. Subway station (Lavender) was a 5 minute walk away and very easy to use.
The not so good
The room was the smallest I have ever been in. It barely had enough space for the bed, only 1 bedside table....thank goodness we got a room with a window otherwise I think I may have been struck down with claustrophobia. The bathroom also very small.
It might be fine for a single trip to Singapore where you wouldn't;t have too much luggage but for our trip, we had just spent 3 weeks in Thailand and this was a stop on the way home...2 large suitcases and 2 small carry cases made for a very cramped room. As well as being cramped, there is only a small area for hanging space so, no actual wardrobe and of course then no extra pillows. I'm sure I could have called down for an extra pillow but I'm not sure we'd have had the room for it....kidding of course, but only just.
So in conclusion... if you are visiting for a 3-4 days trip only or you are a solo traveller then this would be OK but, for our purposes it wasn't so great.",,"Sydney, Australia",134 ,76 ,3.0,
Date of stay: December 2019,Jacky Arjono,Convenient Yet Value for Money Stay at Hotel Boss Singapore,"I am quite a regular traveler to Singapore due to my business activity, but last weekend i visit Singapore only for one reason: attending U2 Live Concert at The National Stadium. I did not make any booking straight away after i got confirmation for the concert‚Äôs ticket since i am quite aware that it would not be too difficult to find appropriate accommodation in Singapore especially nearby the venue.

Just a few days before my departure schedule, i started to search for any available accommodation option nearby Bugis area. I am looking for strategic place nearby MRT station and also within walking distance to Bugis area since i am also planning to visit Raffles Hospital to meet my old colleague who is working there.

After i book my flight tickets i was looking into the area map, i found interesting venue Hotel Boss (slightly unique due to its name), then i visited the website to see the pictures gallery. Understood that the location is very near to Lavender MRT and also within walking distance to Bugis, right away i made room reservation at the hotel.

Arrives at the Lavender MRT from the Changi Airport, it only took around 5 minutes walk to Hotel Boss. The location in the corner is very strategic. When entering the lobby, it was the nice, bright, and spacious one, greeted by friendly concierge staff, then i had express check in process that only took 5 minutes, very effective and efficient. After that i took elevator to the 11th floor for my Superior Queen room. Entering the room, it was a nice one, not too large but seems like still quite newly set up, nice bathroom with shower, have mini bar that i could keep the complimentary bottled drink water cool, and the LED TV. The AC temperature was set on 23 degrees, creating nice ambiance inside the room (it was hot Sunday noon on that day). The room has a wide window with river view, i like it.

That was almost 1 PM so i went straight to Bugis area for lunch. Very nice walking distance to Bugis, only 10 minutes later i reached Zamzam Restaurant to have my Briyani Rice with Chicken Curry for lunch, seating in front of the packed restaurant facing the historical Sultan Mosque.

I didn‚Äôt really explore much on hotel facility since i spent the evening at the Concert venue until late night. While back to the hotel, the Queen size bed already waiting for me. The bed was comfortable, simple but made me slept well that night.

The next day i woke up early to visit my friend at Raffles Hospital, it was only needed around 10
minutes. Then after that i explore Bugis Village and Bugis Junction to shop several things for my kids and friends at home.

Back to the hotel it was already 12.50 noon, supposed to have check out immediately. The friendly Front Desk staff allowed me to get my belongings at the room, then i went back to the lobby desk for express check out less than 5 minutes.

Since my flight back to Jakarta was ETD 3 PM, i decided to take MRT from Lavender to Changi Airport. It was very easy and convenient since i stayed at Hotel Boss that very close to anywhere of my destination during my short visit to Singapore.

We were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view of the city from the 19th floor. The room was serviced daily, and although compact, was comfortable and clean. Breakfast daily, included in the price at time of booking, provided a variety of cuisine and topped up regularly - no excuse to go hungry here. You can also dine here for dinner if you desire.
Tocha Bistro is only metres from the hotel lobby and has good daily deals on alcoholic drinks so you can certainly save a few dollars. Meals here are also worth trying. Our favourites being the steak and the salmon!
There is also a Gloria Jeans cafe in the lobby where you can sit and watch the people of the world go by!
The hotel pool was convenient and we loved relaxing here after walking to and from nearby attractions like Arab Street, Mustafa Centre and Little India.
Hotel Boss is close to the MRT's Lavender Station, a short walk, and you can also hop on a bus right out the front. The transport system is brilliant. If you need advice on how to navigate your way around the city just ask the friendly hotel staff. If you buy tickets at the hotel to local attractions like Gardens by the Bay or the zoo, you get discounted entry.
Can't recommend Hotel Boss enough. We will definitely be staying here again on our next visit.

Date of stay: November 2019,Louiae W,Mixed Feelings About Our Stay at Hotel Boss,"We were looking forward to our stay in a SUPERIOR room at Hotel Boss....the last stop before home. We arrived to a very manic & noisy Reception area and it was even difficult to hear the Receptionist at the Service Desk! The staff were very nice and they had listened to my request and given us a quiet room (Level 17) away from the lifts. When we arrived in the room I couldn‚Äôt believe that it was a SUPERIOR room as it was VERY small in size so I called down to Reception where I was informed that all SUPERIOR rooms were 44square feet in size and that we were. In the right room. There is no room to put your suitcases and you can barely walk around the bed. The decor is dark grey/ black and it is very claustrophobic! The bathroom though small again was clean and the shower was good. Little extras such as a daily toothbrush and toothpaste was useful. Soap, shampoos were good too.

Positives, free bottles of water daily, clean sheets most days and nice staff.

Negatives. Reception area and Breakfast area MANIC! We ad our worst experience ever at a hotel for Breakfast. There were too many people for the space, no seats available, crammed tables, dirty dishes everywhere & poor waiters trying to cope with massive task. Food area not hygienic with food remnants from containers, unwanted toast stacking up. Even had hot melon which I‚Äôve never ever experienced before. The next day we found an alternative venue for breakfast!

We think there were a lot of Offers on with free breakfast (¬£60 a room) whilst we were staying so the hotel was to blame for too much demand. We know because we were thinking of paying more for a bigger room so did some investigating on the Hotel Boss Offers on line.

If you want a stop over for 1 night only WITHOUT breakfast then it maybe a good option otherwise steer clear. 3 nights was too much.

Location too far out for main central places and we needed a Tourist Card for transport. Buses and underground very near. Places such as Little India fairly near but not the main tourist attractions like Gardens of the Bay etc.

Overall, we wouldn‚Äôt stay again.",,"Coventry, United Kingdom",270 ,134 ,3.0,

Date of stay: November 2019,jsssss65,Would definitely reccomend,"We stayed in Hotel Boss for 3 nights when in Singapore. The hotel looks classy on the outside, but exceeds expectations when entering - the reception area is beautiful and spacious. We were checked in quickly, although most of the staff were quite blunt (not rude, just very neutral).

I can‚Äôt say I was expecting the room to be quite so small, however it came with complimentary water, coffee/hot beverages, air con and a nice sized bathroom (when taking into consideration the size of the rest of the room, anyway). It was also very clean, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We were also blessed with a nice view.

The location of the hotel is very good, very close to an MRT station and many taxi services running (comfort delgro we found was a reliable one). We opted to walk for the majority of the trip; it was around 30 minutes to Marina Bay and all the activities there. There is also many variations of street food available a short walk from the hotel (golden mile food court offer a good variety, or foodrepublic is a little further away).

The pool facilities were lovely. The pool was quite small which would not have been convenient during summer holidays etc, however it was very quiet when we visited. The view from the pool is amazing. The gym facility is located right next to the pool, and although we didn‚Äôt visit, it was a nice addition to everything else this hotel offers.

The Hotel is the right compromise in case you look for International Style and good position to travel around Singapore.

I was a bit surprised by the small dimensions of the rooms (very small and comparable with japanise Hotels) and the high number of families, who have met there. I have not been able to check the breakfast quality. I left very early in the morning.

Hotel is very close to the underground and it is very close to the City Center. Good locations to exploit the public transport services.

One small details to consider: if you want to eat around the Hotel you are forced to accept the chinese or the indian style only. It is not bad but it is better to know it in advance.

For sure I will come back again in my next business trip to Singapore",,,13 ,24 ,3.0,

The room didn‚Äôt have an alarm clock. The tissue paper felt like sandpaper. No glasses in the bathroom, so we had to use 2 of the 3 mugs they gave us. I used one mug to drink milk and they never washed it. So if you use the mugs you have to wash them. The room was dusty, and I picked up hair and other matter when I wiped the bathroom sink and other surfaces. The glass shower door, which didn‚Äôt shut all the way, had lots of fingerprints.
The pros, it was within walking distance of a station (Lavender). There was a good hawker center called Epic Haus between the hotel and station, where we had good Singaporean breakfast and Japanese breakfast. The rooms did have toothbrushes, toothpaste, a shower cap, and complimentary bottles of water although the water was horrible. The room had a good view of the city.

Everything about the experience was substandard and I would not recommend a stay here. The hotels images do not reflect the room that we stayed in. Our room was the smallest hotel room I have experienced, two very uncomfortable single beds, one pillow on each and barely space to move. The window looked into an internal void where multiple other rooms looked directly into ours. The bathroom was so small, the door had to open into the hall, resulting in the entrance door not being able to be opened.
The bathroom had a white growth in the corner of the shower and black mould on the ceiling. The towels had pulled threads and holes and the external bathroom wall had red dots on the wall which may well have been blood.

Our experience at this hotel is not impress... situation is we left our key card in the room for stand by the electricity because we have to go outside and when we come back we need to get recover and refresh. For the first day is fine everything normal room was turn down clean...

But for the second day we have an activity outside and we are very sweat and tired when we reach the room and i opened the door everything was shut down, how come??? they can remove the card from our room... we pay quite high cost for the small room but it's fine and how come they can do like that?? and the thing that make me very upset is the ""KEY CARD"" it's gone... if they need to save the electricity why they didn't remove and put the key card on the desk. But why they can take our card??? when i call to operator they said we can going to the lobby to get a new card... i think they should have some solution is better than told us to go to the Lobby to get a new card that we didn't lost but it's gone because hotel's staff.

If your hotel cannot left the card for electricity please infrom when guest check-in.

We payed for the whole day but it's doesn't make sense that we cannot use although we are not in the room!!.

Date of stay: September 2019,Shafraz B,Worst Hotel,"This was the worst hotel i have ever visited in my whole life time.First time in singapore with a family of 5 and an infant we had high expectation on the hotel considering it being a 4 star hotel with a luxury and big outer appearance. We had booked two rooms a triple and a double rooms for the stay through our agent almost 1 month in advance but during check in the staff says the two rooms are in two seperate floors...being a family we always expected to stay in the same floor in nearby rooms but it didnt happen and this was the first disappointment.

After all the check in process once you get into your room you may feel like what the hell! The rooms are just so so tiny.you have no proper place to keep your luggages inside, no cupboards nothing! And if you hardly manage to keep your luggages somewhere inside it would be very difficult to walk inside the room because it is that small! And no words about the bathroom/ toilet that it could be comfortably used only for a tiny human being! It is such a tiny bathroom the comod is so small that looks like a perfect fit for a small kid! And even the shower space is so tiny! And once you use the toilet it stinks! Come on you even dont have an exhaust fan inside! Being a 4 star hotel!
I‚Äôve been to many budget hotels around the world but even most of them were more spacious than this place! The towel that was provided in the second day of our stay had a yellow stain in it! How aweful!

We had booked the rooms on BB basis and expected the breakfast to be inside the hotel but funny the people at the reception direct you to a tiny (again tiny) restaurant outside the hotel doors on the ground floor inside the same building though to a small restaurant called Maya‚Äôs kitchen which only serves indian food! It is very difficult to find a seat inside since all indian guests are directed to this place where its crowded like a market during the breakfast hours!

How did the hotel judge or guess that we eat indian food? As a guest from Srilanka and not India, we always expect a standard international menu for breakfast that all kind of people can enjoy! But this didnt happen! We had to taste food that we have never had before!

Over all i am very dis satisfied with the hotel!",Trip type: Travelled with family,,5 ,7 ,1.0,

The staff at this hotel were extremely friendly all round . Very helpful when asked for assistance. The staff in the lobby especially, always friendly and very good with pointers towards local attractions and whereabouts of places to visit and also on how to get there.

The chief guest service managers were brilliant . Very friendly , always taking time to have a conversation and help us in any way . Especially Miss Fiona , Miss Hidayah and most of all Mr Faizal.
Mr Faizal would take his time to talk to us and advise us on what to do and places to visit . I have travelled to many places , but Mr Faizal has to be best person I met working in a hotel. Just a genuinely good human being .

The hotel is in a great location which is always a plus.  Close to hawker stalls, malls, and the popular 24hr. Mustafa Shopping Centre.  Easy access to bus and MRT, and if you use Grab, the cost to go to any of the tourist attractions are reasonable from the hotel. The rooms are small, however if you're efficient, you can make it fit 2 large luggages and still have walking room.  The staff is helpful and friendly, even during the busiest of times.  Kudos to the cleaning staff, and special acknowledgement of our room attendant Nanthanat who was especially friendly and helpful, I wish all staff was like her.  Overall a great experience, although I can't give it a 5 star rating due to the accommodations being small, however if I could give it a 4.5 that would be a more accurate assessment for my taste.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,1 ,2 ,4.0,

I have been to hotels across Asia, and honestly, this is one hard policy many hotels abide by, meaning 2pm check-in is 2pm.

The room was awesome, the location was extremely great as I was sheltered right after alighting from the Metro station Lavender. Making my meetings in the CBD located near Raffles Place MRT, Orchard Road MRT and Tanjong Pagar MRT (all within 6 station stops) a lot easier.

Date of stay: July 2019,Ragan Tang,Worst bellman service,"Making a reservation of 3 rooms online for 3 nights to enjoy early check in and late check out.
Upon arriving at 0800, we are told to wait for 1 hour to check for room availability for early check in. However, as expected rooms are not ready, therefore we made a move to store our luggages with the bellman.
When we are at the bell desk, we have to approach one of the bellman and ask for luggage storage. The bellman just gestured us to the racks to store our luggage without any assistance, my Girlfriend and I struggled with 6 bags and 1 large suitcase.
Upon reaching the racks, the bellman asked discourteously how many bags are we storing, and start to command us to place them on the top of the rack, he even assume that one of the bag contains food, we went ahead to clarify and he accepted the bag reluctantly.
After dining at founders bak kut teh (just beside the hotel), we return to hotel boss hoping to check in. Understand that it early check in is subjected to room availability but we are only allowed into 2 rooms at 1430 hrs.
Went to the bell desk and asked to sent up the luggage but was not attended by any bellman. A believe-to-be bellman manager (wearing blazer), approached me and said our luggage had been sent to our room, so I made my way up. However, when reaching the room our luggages were nowhere to be seen. Went down to clarify with the manager and he realised that it was a mistake, and went ahead to apologise and anticipate to assist in carrying all the luggage up. It was a definitely a commendable act from him.
In one of our room, the ‚Äòless water‚Äô flush was broken and on the second day, one of our room was missed out by the housekeeping as it was not been tidied up.
Late check out at 1500hrs was given, however the same horrendous service was faced when we want to store our luggage at the bell desk.
Overall, the service staffs at the reception were friendly and and very approachable, but the bell desk team was horrible. The way they deliver their service was definitely unacceptable, and have yet to comment on the way they communicate with their guest, definitely a rotten Apple that spoils the barrel.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",3 ,1 ,2.0,

The reality was somewhat different.","""On a tour of one-night stands, my suitcase and guitar in hand"" (with apologies to Simon and Garfunkel) seems to sum up the Hotel Boss.  The ""superior"" room seemed more like an upmarket cramped prison cell. The balcony overlooked a vast three-sided canyon of glass and metal, which echoed with the roar of air-conditioning units day and night and was hot and humid. If you look in the top left or right corner of the hotel's own website images depicting the room interior, you'll see the ""closet"" - a short metal bar strung up under the TV set, holding seven clothes hangers.  That's it.  Barely room for two people to move in, a ridiculously tiny bath/shower room, one-way traffic only between the bed(s) and the opposite wall and one small stand for suitcases.  Definitely suited only for the single traveller for a one-night stand.   Good location, with easy public transport access and a range of food and retail outlets within easy walking distance.

I moved to Premium room with balcony, which still was not too big, but the balcony view was Amazing. I would highly recommend this room just for the view from the balcony.

Another gripe I had was that you could not order food in the room. After a whole day of travel, I wish I could have my food in the room. Also, no Indian foods are available at the hotel. You can step out to find a good restaurant named Mayas Kitchen though.

Pros-
1. Extremely helpful staff, special thanks to Mr. Tan Lin Chong for assisting us.
2. Hotel Boss is very well known in Singapore, so it is very easy to locate it or get a cab.
3. Taxi stand is right in the hotel and is available round the clock. Bus stand is within 50mts. Even Lavender MRT is closeby.
4. Free high speed wifi. 12 high speed elevators.
5. Laundry facility available at nominal price.
6. Popular localities like Little India, Mustafa market is within 1km.
7. Eateries and cafeterias available around the hotel. Indian vegetarian food easily available.
8. Various shops around the hotel available for day to day requirements. Even SIM cards and souvenir can be purchased from these shops at cheaper prices.
9. Fast food joints like McDonalds are within 500mts from this hotel. Great help for late night dinners.
10. Park behind the hotel is a nice place to stroll in the evening with a water body next to it.

Cons-
1. Rooms are very small, with no cupboards or wardrobe to store clothes. Although a digital locker is available.
2. Bathroom is even smaller
3. Breakfast buffet has almost the same menu every day, which is boring. Indian Vegetarian options are less except for boiled vegetables.

Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel.
I would definitely like to stay with them in my future trips.

We just completed our stay in this hotel before 3 Days . Let me give some of my views for the hotel .
We selected this hotel for our stay in our trip returning to India from Australia üá¶üá∫. The main reason to select the hotel was its reviews and location on the site . Even though high prices compared to other hotels we selected it .
I could find some points which were not upto our expectations which are as follows .

1) You should serve welcome drink when you know that you are serving on tourist destination and All the Guests are coming from Abroad .
2) When you are coming or going out of the gates of hotel and some staff members are standing there they won‚Äôt bother or greet you with smile ... You should find your way . Most of the staff have no smile on faces .

2) The rooms are so so small ... I know almost all the hotels have small rooms in Singapore but we had confirmed for Family room first and at the time of booking we were informed for 2 rooms separated , though we were fine for that but the size of the rooms like you can‚Äôt open or place your bags of 23 kg on floor .

3) The TV working but no cable channel . It‚Äôs only for free to air channels . Very sad and disappointing when you have a stay of 3 nights and coming to hotel only for night after day excursions .

4) No Sound proof rooms ... Yes . Beware before you speak loudly .

5) Breakfast ... The most disappointing part ... Looked like it‚Äôs managed to be run on the most economical way ... No tea ‚òïÔ∏è ... No Chocos for kids ... No live counter for Omlet or something like that ... Only scrambled eggs kept in bulk ... There was one option in Veg Indian Idli but no chutney or sambhar to accompany and trust me idli doesn‚Äôt sound or taste good with coffee !!! No review expectation from guests ... We completed 1st day breakfast and told our agent to cancel the breakfast for remaining 2 days and give me refund ... He talked to the agency via email and still waiting for the response . We didn‚Äôt prefer to go for breakfast for 2nd and 3rd day . Details must be there with the management as they scan the room key before entry to the area of breakfast .

These was my experience . I will surely upgrade the ratings to 3* if Get the refund of my breakfast or it will be 1* after 3 days . May be it makes difference or not to the management but I will go for it .

Good Luck .

Thanks ,

Date of stay: June 2019,Someotherland,Compact but Adequate,"My sister and I are staying in Hotel Boss for a week long holiday to Singapore. As we have been a few times before to Singapore and stayed in different areas we thought this would be a change. Hotel itself is large and our room on 18th floor is small but adequate for two sisters and their belongings. Not wardrobe but a small hanging rail. We always travel with a few coathangers so were able to hang our clothes without much problem. We also brought with us some 4 hanger skirt/trouser hangers which were invaluable. Beds very comfortable and air/con great. Shower was perfect in the tiny bathroom.
Our room attendant, Nanthanat from Thailand, was wonderful. New towels etc every day and fresh bed linen. Our water bottles and other supplies were also replaced daily. Nanthanat is a lovely courteous and friendly girl and lovely to have as our room attendant. All in all a great stay. My one complaint is the food at breakfast, this morning we went to breakfast and got bread to toast. It had mould on the crusts of the bread! Not very healthy.",,"Hazelmere, Australia",169 ,84 ,4.0,
Date of stay: June 2019,James H,Not that bad as the reviews shown,"My stay at Hotel Boss wasn't that bad. No doubt the rooms are small but I guess that is expected for hotel rooms in Singapore.

There was a couple of drunks at my friend's room at 2am and I had to go down to ask the receptionist to send some people up. They were quick and it got solved pretty fast too. She was scared and after that they change her room which is the same floor as mine. Pretty good I would say.

The room was cleaned up pretty well however there was some smoke smell in the toilet, I guess the previous person smoked in the toilet so I couldn't spend that much time in the toilet but the room was fine.

Overall 4 stars out of 5. Things to improved if the toilet had been ionized prior to my stay then I would give it a 5 star given the price I paid for the room.",Trip type: Travelled on business,,54 ,52 ,,4.0
Date of stay: June 2019,Rani S,Family Vacation in Singapore,"I stayed in the Boss Hotel for 10 days with my family of 4.

I'll start with the cons:

‚Ä¢Small rooms, to the point that you can't have two people walking around.

‚Ä¢Rooms are not fully sound proof

Now for the pros:

‚Ä¢The transportation services are convieniently close by. It is so easy to go everywhere throughout the city using the metro or bus that being close is such a good perk. We used the metro and bus maybe up to 3 times a day. It's a 2-3 minutes walk from the lobby to the metro. The bus station is right under the hotel. Airport shuttle is available from the hotel.

‚Ä¢The hotel is between Little India and the Jln Sultan district which retains the old style of housing and has good shops, food, and a chill street of pubs (cars can't enter so everyone's sitting on tables on the street which I like).

‚Ä¢There's a food court and a few restaurants on the bottom of the hotel where you can try the local cuisine or get the local Kopi (coffee) or Teh (tea). There are two bars also, one of which I tried (Tocha) and it's good. There's a minimarket (Cheers) that's open late and where you can get much of what you need (also tobacco products and spirits).

‚Ä¢The staff is friendly and caring. We were greeted warmly by Wei Liang at the reception, and our room attendant Nanthanat is a beautiful soul, always smiling and making sure we were comfy.

‚Ä¢Theres a small yard belonging to the hotel where you can sit or stroll alongside the river. The pool in the terrace is lovely even at night. I loved the gardening in both the pool and park, but especially the trees and shrubs around the pool area.

In general this is a good value hotel, and I'd recommend it. Would stay here gain.",Trip type: Travelled with family,,2 ,3 ,5.0,

Date of stay: May 2019,vmaravind,Nice hotel,"We stayed at hotel Boss from 17th May to 24th May. We landed in Singapore at about 1 AM, and we checked in at about 2:30. Check in process was very smooth, and we got 3 key cards which needs to be shown even in the lift for getting to the floor we need to go. No office boy was there to help us with the luggage.

Rooms: Rooms are small, as is a general case with all hotels in Singapore. They are pretty clean. We had a wonderful view to the city from our room.

Lifts: There are ample lifts which are huge. They are quite clean too.

Swimming pool: The pool which is in the 4th floor is good, and I think the height is about 5 feet everywhere. Didn't see a kids pool area.

GYM: The GYM seems to be good with a few threadmills and a single workout equipment.

Travel agents: There is a travel agent to help you visit the attractions.

Breakfast: We had complementary breakfast opted. The breakfast timing is from 6:30 AM to 10:30 AM. Breakfast was pretty much the same everyday. Fruits (always water melon and green apple), cabbage, tomato slices, bread, Jam, Butter, porridge, noodles, soup, some type of flakes, milk, juices, coffee for vegetarians. I saw chicken and pork as non-veg dishes. The staff inside the restaurant made sure everything was always full.

To improve: The staff is rude. They have no idea about customer delight. Felt like a govt office. I liked the idea of a $5 fine for any food being uneaten, and also if food is taken out. They did not even allow me to take a bread slice and a couple of water melon pieces for my toddler. A lady, kind of, shouted at me and demanded to pay the fine if I took it.

Can you amagine if a room for 4 family members. The bathroom is very small. The shower knob holder not functioning well. The basin water pressure is bad. The shower door rubber broken. The toilet bowl space very small.

This hotel definitely qualified for 3 stars rating. The reception crews are friendly. The location is consider good and near to Lavendar MRT walking distance 7 to 8 minutes. It also near to Bugis junction. It takes only 2 bus stops from Bugis junction to hotel entrance. Hotel lobby outside near by can get some foods and walking a bit more you can try dim sum. Not bad.

Family room balcony is spaces.... Lol better then in the room walking spaces. The day time look OK. Night time scary. Almost totally dark.

This hotel room don't have proper wardrobe. The corridoor smell and look bit dull. The lobby always busy even at late night. They have a lot of Indian guests. Almost from morning till night you will see a lot of Indian group peoples at lobby. Very busying and noisy lobby.

Taxi and bus facilities are convenience. The room cleaner will not clean your room if you left your key card in the power supply slot. When we came back around 4.30pm cleaner said she dare not go in for cleaning since you left the card inside.

The pool, the indoor playground for small children (slides, see-saws, etc.), and one of the restaurants is on the fourth floor. The interior design and planning of the hotel can be well appreciated. The lobby is very beautiful with a nice centerpiece and a chandelier; and with the people at the reception counter being very welcoming and efficient at their work.

The real concern and drawback with the Hotel is its Breakfast . 5 days in a row we were served same breakfast ... with same menu repeated or just one item changed every alternate days. If you are vegetarian you need to survive on Toast and on fruits , fruits were also same only last day instead of water melon we were served apple .  I even raised my concern with the head chef but he said that menu is given by the Hotel Management and he cannot do much .. Also mind it its an 4 star property but there is no live food counter . Also think to mark is that we have chosen Asian BF and there were 90% Indians in the restaurant but no Indian food . So for 5 days we survived on bread butter /  Kellogg / fruits . so even thou you are paying good amount for food you will end up having nothing there .

Date of stay: April 2019,Gagan S,"Small Rooms, cramped bathroom, No cupboard or cutlery. Don't get fooled by 4* label","I travel alot for work and have been to 20+ countries and 30 odd cities outside of India. This by far is the worst hotel I have stayed in. I am not sure how can this be a 4* hotel, it is not even a 2 star hotel. They have a huge reception area that gives you a grand feeling, however the moment you get your rooms, that grand feeling turns into grand disappointment

Here is what is wrong
- Extremely small rooms with cramped bathrooms and I mean really small rooms. I upgraded to a triple room assuming it will be bigger than double room as I was traveling with my kids. I was wrong, this is one of the smallest room that they have. I would have been better off, taking two rooms as I would have still paid lesser amount for 2 rooms than taking a triple bed room.

- Cramped bathroom, you don't have space to move at all.

- No cupboards in room, when we complained their answer is it is not mentioned on the website, well in a 4 star hotel this is expected to be there if it is not mentioned that this hotel doesn't have cupboards.

- No Cutlery in room, We ordered some food from a nearby restaurant. when we called reception for some cutlery, guess their answer. It is not mentioned on the website and we don't have it. Which hotel mentions that they provide Plates and Spoons in room on request. And who checks that before booking a room. I was not able to believe that the hotel has the audacity to say that you should have checked before booking the room.

- The only good thing about the hotel is location, however we saw multiple hotels in the same location and I am willing to bet that all of them would be better than this hotel.

In short, I would not recommend this hotel and suggest you look for another hotel rather than wasting money on this one.",Trip type: Travelled with family,,9 ,2 ,1.0,

Date of stay: April 2019,Prasanna,Small rooms but comfortable stay - Courteous staff but some of the staff need some training though,"very well welcomed by the staff initially. Especially Mr. Tan Lin Chong who helped us in settling down and feel comfortable while we were checking in. He was specifically very sweet and demonstrating the Singapore hospitality extremely well. Kudos to you sir. It is because of people like you that SIngapore lives up to the expectations of a tourist

Next, the rooms. Very small, but later we realised that it is just sufficient for a descent comfortable stay. Would have been good had it been a bit more bigger

The Front desk staff are by and large courteous but definitely need some training to appear more smiling and receptive. They can be more welcoming when it comes to queries which guests may have. For e.g. i just had a simple request to change my breakfast cafe as I found more Indian option in Floor 1. It was as if i was committing a big mistake by asking for that change. Sentences like ""Ensure you do not change again"" was particularly not well received. I felt, as a guest, I deserved better. After all, it is just a simple request. In fact, I should have been firstly asked for options of cafe when I checked in itself.

Coming to Breakfast, If you are a vegetarian, my suggestion is, do not go for breakfast option at all here. Very limited options. Instead a 10 min walk to Little India would do better and you can easily save some quick bucks above bearing with the smelly non-veg cafe. My personal view here.

Another good part here was the flexibility in early check-in and check-out a bit late at 1 PM. Staff was considerate with that.

Allowing baggage to be stored in hotel drive-in was a great service. Kudos to the hotel for that

I particularly wanted to comment on some of the staff who were very rude. When checking-out, one of the staff who helped with the check-out luggage shifting from room was absolutely ill mannered. I wish, I could take a picture of him to post here and get the management to take some rap on the knuckles action on such staff who are so rude. He was acting so damn weird especially when we were packing some stuff in the lobby. We come from a very descent family from India and obviously know our responsibility when it comes to throwing items to bins. He acted pre-maturely and was directing us to throw the litter assuming we will not. Come on, why the hell do you assume?
I request the management to display the photo of all the staff so that I can point the staff here.

The maintenance guy said he would have a new remote delivered but by day two it had not appeared.   This may sound trivial but it meant that as long as the power was on in the room, I could not switch off the TV so there was a considerable light source throughout the night.   Not what I needed after 30 hours travelling and desirous of rest.   Another request to the Reception got me a new remote.   Happy days.

Date of stay: March 2019,kkkaur,Horrible and mouldy,I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.  I booked it based on reviews on trip but my experience was very different. This is a cheap hotel and no where the 3/4* rating it was receiving.  The bathroom was covered in mould and i complained and they wanted to send someone up at half past midnight to clean it. I said the morning would be better but it was never cleaned.  We had breakfast here and that was even worse. The dishes were dirty. I asked a member of staff several times for a clean cup he didn't speak English and just walked off and left me there. So i helped myself and washed it myself at their sink and all the staff were quick to gang around me to tell me i can't. I explained if anyone was willing to gove me a clean dish but nobody did. The rooms are only suitable for 2 people. Anymore it's too small. The best looking thing about this hotel is the lobby.  The one thing i will rate them for is that we're around at 7am and they allowed us to check in at that time. After a long flight we needed that. There was also a load of people just sleeping in the lobby area and looked more like a shelter.  I mean for the money i don't expect grande but cleanliness is paramount.  It makes all the difference and even when i highlighted it it wasn't addressed just thought what's the point. You felt dirty having a shower and just don't feel clean no matter what. There were hairs stuck in the shower head (see picture) and bogies stuck to shower walls (too disgusted to even attempt to photograph that). Went to the shop bought my own  cleaning wipes. I did make a video where i turned over a dozen cups in the breakfast area to prove my point but it wouldn't upload. The breakfast was cold. They make a load then leave it at the back and keep topping it up. The tea was made like coffee.  One teabag it seemed to a whole coffee jug. It was extremely weak and by the time you add a droplet of milk it was enough to make a very white tea. They don't give teabags. The cutlery was dirty too. I was wiping everything.,Trip type: Travelled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",41 ,37 ,,1.0

The hotel is always busy and reception being the hub is always well staffed, the receptionist speak good English and are extremely helpful, the room was adequate but could have been cleaner, attention to the bathroom and sparse coat hanger area in particular, only 2 bath towels provided, no hand towels or flannels. Two tea bags for 2 days again isn't what we expected. The rooms were very noisy when above guests moved chairs and you are able to hear adjoining room guest speak etc. The facilities offered,.pool etc. Really good as is the restaurant food quality, just a shame the room prep and facilities could have been better. It is ideally placed for Kampong Glam and hop on/off bus root. The hotel is good value for money. Singapore is well worth a visit.

Date of stay: April 2019,Ryan H,Total unprofessionalism displayed by Front Office Staff,"A booking was made for a friend at Hotel Boss age 19 and 16 years of age. Upon check in, I received a call from the guest saying that Hotel Boss had rejected their booking and refuse to let them check in. Feeling puzzled with the situation that happened, I spoke to the reception over the phone and was told that any guest that is below the age of 18 is not allow to check in. Yes, it is true that no hotel in the world is allow to accept reservation for guest that is below the legal check in age. However, the reservation was made for one of the guest that is 19 years of age, which is perfectly legal. In order to clarify on the situation, I asked to speak to the Duty Manager (which I was told that her name is Hidayah). She refused to even pick up the phone and speak to me. Instead, she asked the Front Office staff to tell me that she will not speak to anyone that she doesn't know. If that is the case, why are you in the hospitality industry in the first place? What kind of professionalism are you showing if you refuse to speak to a guest? And you are holding the title of Duty Manager for Hotel Boss? Wow, amazing I must say.

As the issue is still unresolved due to the ""professionalism"" shown by Duty Manager Hidayah, I have personally went down to Hotel Boss to sort out this matter. Upon arrival, I was told that Duty Manager Hidayah was not around at the moment. Truly professional I must say. She must have set a truly good example of how a Duty Manager must act while on Duty, which is refuse to speak to guest and not around the reception while on duty. Great job Ms Hidayah

Instead, Mr Jason Yap, the Front Office Manager came to speak to me. I have told him that I understand that the Hotel reserved the rights to reject guest which is not of legal age to check in. However for my case, one of the guest is already 19 (with all legal document provided). Isn't she liable to check in?

The reason that Mr Jason Yap gave was the hotel reserved the rights to reject any booking that they deemed fit. No question asked

Truly professional Mr Jason Yap and Ms Hidayah (though I never get to see her or even hear her voice during her duty as a Duty Manager). Well, I do have to add that Mr Jason Yap had commented that he will make a full refund for this booking despite all the inconvenience caused. And I have to wait for at least 14 days or more to get the refund.

Lastly, there's nothing more I can do, but to ask one more question before I leave. Why was this booking rejected since the guest is already 19 years of age? Is there any particular reason for him to do so? Again, as you might have guessed, the answer is, the Hotel reserved the rights to do so, ""no question asked"". This is all he can tell me during the entire conversation

Shower water is very hot no matter how you adjust.

Date of stay: March 2019,Zlosnica00,Very average.,"Rooms are very very small. Not a massive problem for me, as I was only seeing it as a place to sleep. However, my sister found it very claustrophobic.
We paid extra for a room with a balcony. Waste of money. We got a room ""inside"", which means we were looking into the court, instead of outside 'city' views. Room was very dark, even during the day.
Bed was comfortable, but could do with another pillow.
No bedside lamp, and only one bedside table. Lighting in the room was disappointing. You had to get up from the bed, to switch some of the lights off.
Bathroom was small, and shower very temperamental (going from hot to cold without touching anything).
Pool area big and airy, yet not enough sun beds, and no staff members to help. I saw drunk people using lifering for their own alcohol induced entertainment...
Lastly, biggest disappointment: breakfast. Very, and I mean very limited choice. Only white or brown toasted bread, some form of noddles, funny looking sausages and ""scrambled eggs"". No cheese at all, no bread selection, no vegtables, no yoghurts, no fruit (only melon), no boiled/fried eggs, no cold cuts etc. I'm not a picky eater, as I can always find something on buffet breakfast, but not here.

Room was small by western standards, but common size for Singapore. However, still okay for the three of us. Remember you are not going on holiday to stay in your hotel room. Blinds made the room nice and dark at night. Beds were comfortable as were the pillows. View was great.
Towels, toiletries and water bottles were replenished, along with beds being made, daily which was great.
Great wifi which reconnects when back in range - an absolute must these days.
Pool was a good size and a good temperature. Nice and clean too. Change in your room prior to going. Also a water bottle refilling station by the pool towels was a nice surprise and handy so we didn't have to keep buying water.
Jubilicious restaurant (in the hotel complex) for buffet breakfast was nice and some of the food did change, but obviously the standard staples for breakfast will always be available. Remember to go to reception and purchase breakfast before arriving at restaurant.
Close to the MRT (Lavendar station) and bus stops outside the hotel. Taxis easily accessible from lobby too.

PROS:
Great wifi.
Great pool.
Staff friendly and helpful - remember respect goes two ways.
Easy to access MRT & buses.

CONS:
The smell when you enter the lobby took ages to get used too. Think its the cleaning products they use.
Could hear the neighbours so easily, so very thin walls.
When the neighbours turned on the light by their window, our room would become brighter.
You had to pay for breakfast at reception each day you wanted it before going to the restaurant - would have been better to have the option to tick it up and charge the credit card once at the end for all breakfasts / other incidentals.

We have arrived in Singapore on 3rd December 2018 and still continuing our stay in Hotel Boss Singapore even today. We would be leaving to India in next 4 to 5 days after finishing our work here. Our prolonged stay in Hotel Boss could be possible only due to the fantastic hospitality extended by their staff.

Date of stay: December 2018,Cal_Mariko,Very basic but otherwise comfortable,"Stayed overnight as an interim plan for a pre-arranged booking in Sentosa which did not go as planned. This is your typical hotel suited mostly for transient corporate people going for short business trips which I think is quite common in SG. The room we got was very basic, not much room to move about, but otherwise clean and comfortable. I'm sure there are rooms more spacious. There is an ice and water station at every floor which is always convenient for guests. A money changer counter is also conveniently located on the ground floor. Found it a bit odd that the toilets in the lobby are located outside. The automatic sliding doors are a nice touch (no germs!) altho there was an old man who slightly panicked as he didn't know how to operate the door. Good thing I was there. Poor guy.

Not really a first choice for tourists but if you do decide to book here, there are food hubs along Lavender which is a short walking distance to the place. There is also Haji Lane and Arab Street 2 kilometers away, an interesting place to visit and hang out. The nearest MTR station would either be Lavender or Bugis.

Happened to book Hotel Boss accommodation online due to the  good reviews - and we're (along with cousin) now witnessing with our very eyes the good reception and hospitality of the staff, in particular MS. FIONA (Manager-on-duty) who had her way approaching us in the lobby, asking our whereabouts, checking on us (our thoughts on the room service, its size, and amenities). It's so unusual for such staff to find time doing a personal check on the guests, not to mention the busy season and other tasks to work on. We were delighted to be oriented on the places to visit (during our stay), where to ride a bus, the nearest malls, landmarks, eateries, and things to expect. This vacation is extra-special with such amazing customer service... and yes, I have to mention, we were moved by Ms. Fiona to a room with a nice view (just to ensure we are their happy customers!).

On check in, I was assigned a room at level 5. Upon entering the room, the whole room reeked of strong cigarette smell. Someone was smoking in the room before that. It is supposedly a hotel which does not permit smoking in the room???

I had to call reception to assign me with another room.

On the 2nd day, I left the room at 7am and returned at 2pm. When I returned at 2pm, I was surprised to see that the room had not been cleaned. Had to call the reception to get housekeeping to clean the toilet and dispose the trash bins. On the 3rd day, I deliberately called reception at 7am before I leave the room to request for the room to be cleaned by 12pm before I return. When I returned at 2pm, the room was still not cleaned.

I had to speak to the housekeeping staff personally to request for the room to be cleaned before 12pm for the 4th day before it was cleaned before I return.

The size of the room was disappointing and we 3 in a room could not walk and there were no rack to store our used cloths and we have keep them on the floor. Adding to that the rooms were without windows!!!!!

Bath room was so so small and it was stinking and when i complained on the day one the reception was so casual and told he can upgrade the room for 30 SGD per night.

Breakfast menu was same for all 5 days!!!!!!

Its not worth paying so much for the hotel where you cant relax and i never expected how can a 4 star hotel rooms can be like that.

Check inn and Check out process was quite smooth. Location is also great and has a good Indian restaurant ""Maya"" great food.

But i do not suggest this hotel and i will never book this to my customers as myself a Govt approved travel agent.

","Although the hotel's location was good, near to MRT and bus stop, however rooms and bathroom were tiny small for which we actually pay. There is no dish on their Menu for Indian vegetarians, if u eat nonveg u might be able to get something, for pure veggies u have to move to a near by place called Little India for food, keeping in mind that all the restaurants there also closes by 10 pm, so pls ensure that you are not LATE else u have to be fasting that day. The only other good thing apart from location is their duty manager Mr. Ryan Yee who always kept a smile on his face and genuinely and promptly guided and helped the guests. We reached hotel at 11 AM and despite the check in time was 2 PM and since they had room, they allowed us early check-in without any extra charge or much of request. We appreciate their gesture since my mother who is a senior citizen and my 7 years old daughter were very tried after a long flight. Also, the Hotel has a baggage counter where u can keep your luggage in case u have checked out and there is still time left for your flight. If you are an Indian and plan to do more of sight seeing then I would recommend that you should go for some cheaper hotel since u would come back only for sleeping and not b able to use other facilities such as swimming pool and Gym. Since you would use the hotel rooms only for sleeping and getting fresh, and the rooms are tiny small with basic amenities such as AC, Bed, 1.5 ltr drinking bottle, room fridge, Electric kettle for tea/coffee, toiletries, bath towels, TV which u will not use since it does not have any Indian channels moreover you are not in Singapore for wasting your time in watching TV (for food u will have to visit place called little india, which has lot of Indian Restaurants, since as I mentioned the hotel and its surroundings do not have any dish for Indians, only McDonald's is near by at walking distance at Lavender MRT). I booked thru MMT and paid 10,000 per day for 3 adults, which I experienced was on the higher side for sleeping bed and small toilets. Further the lady on the Travel Desk was rude and always busy on her cell phone. She was interested only in her business, so in case you buy tickets to any of the places of interest, she will give u minimal details, forget about any FREE ADVICE, for that you will have to do your own research, also the desk accept CASH only, No Cards are accepted.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Agra, India",36 ,23 ,3.0,

I stayed in the standard single room with queen sized bed for four nights. The room was smaller then what I am accustomed to. No sliding window. Hotel decor in the lobby, hallways and actual room was dark (compare to that of Ibis on Bencoolen - Ibis decore bright, fresh airy feel.)

Large wall mounted lcd tv screen was a plus and wifi connection was excellent. Room cleaning service done on time and done well with fresh towels and replinished supply of tea coffee sugar and water bottles on a daily basis.

I could hear when guests in the room above me flushed their toilets. Shower head in bathroom worn out and needs to be changed.

I observed you can hear noise from guests walking up and down the hallway, that did not bother me but I understand how this would annoy people who prefer total peace and quiet.

But the most awful thing about this ‚Äòhotel‚Äô (more like a hostel) is the noise! There is no sound proofing and people were shouting and talking loudly up and down the corridors at all hours.

It was a very busy place so families must book a few rooms beside each other then just stand in the corridors shouting. The people staying there are rude and inconsiderate

Date of stay: October 2018,Wylie210,You get what you pay for...,"We were excited to finally get to Singapore and enjoy the remainder of our holiday, I booked the room here through a third party website for a very cheap rate and thought we scored a bargain. As the title suggests, turns out you get what you pay for... The staff at the entrance and lobby were very nice and helpful (especially the staff manning the taxi area, always happy and have plenty of advice) so we walked in very happy. Then we got our room keys and headed up, where we found the rooms were tiny, like, really tiny. If you are travelling with two suitcases then you will not have room to open them in the standard rooms, we only had hiking backpacks so were able to make it work, but there is next to no room to move, other than sleep and shower. If you plan to enjoy some time resting in the hotel, then I suggest you book the biggest room with the balcony (still significantly cheap compared to other hotels). The next morning we went to the restaurant for breakfast but as our deal did not include breakfast we were turned away and told to go downstairs to the lobby and upgrade our stay to include breakfast, we declined and went elsewhere for food. Do not buy any food or drink from the hotel, the prices are hiked up way to high, there is a small convenience store where the taxi rank is, they have cheap prices in line with the rest of the city. There is no laundry service at the hotel, they have a self serve 'Laundromat' which is just 3 washing machines and 3 dryers on the fourth floor balcony open to everyone, so unless you have a couple hours spare to sit and watch your washing, maybe find a local laundry service that delivers. That night we went to bed and were woken at around 12 a.m. by our entry hallway light flashing on and off, upon closer inspection I found that the room control panel has shorted out and besides making lights flicker on it also cut out the air-conditioner, leaving the small room to quickly heat up. I called the front desk, and the came to try and fix our problem. About 30 minutes had passed and they were unsuccessful so contacted the manager who then told me they will get us a new room but needed us to pack our room up and head down to the lobby which I was not happy about. I put some clothes on and took the elevator down 19 floors to the front desk where I told them I had no intention on packing all our things and moving rooms at 1 o'clock in the morning, and just wanted a spare room that we could go and sleep the remainder of the night away then worry about packing in the morning. This took around 20 minutes of them saying 'no that's not how it works' and me saying 'yes, yes it is how it works. Your room is faulty and we want to sleep, let us pack in the morning', eventually they gave in and we were given a room 3 doors up that we could go to sleep in. We will not be staying here again, Singapore has heaps of hotels, but if you are travelling on a budget and don't mind about the small details then this may cater for your sleeping needs (assuming your room control panel works)",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",9 ,7 ,3.0,

- great amenities. fresh towel everyday

Cons
- receptionist rude. Please do not say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste my time‚Äù to your patron. I thought you were in the HOSPITALITY industry. I know it can be challenging, communication breakdowns & whatnots, however, please have the decency to NOT make such audacious statements.

Other than that, the room service/housekeeping dept did a good job. Heads up for Mr Liu Fei, & the others. They deserve the mention, for their time & effort to make us comfortable; not like a certain receptionist that apparently we wasted his/her time. I wish that said person well.

She took her time to physically bring us to the the different rooms to see which was perfect before we decided to upgrade. Her excellent service really reflects well on Hotel Boss.

On the second day of our stay , Gwen ( Manager ) assisted us on extending our stay for a few hours , came up to our room to have a chat to see if there is anything she can assist us with and also gave us a written note to thank us for our stay.

Nigel ( Staff ) also took the liberty to come up to our room again to ask if there is anything he can help us with. Great service

Honestly , this has been the greatest service I‚Äôve received from any Hotel. Good Job. üëç

Date of stay: October 2018,Patrick C,Simply BAD,"1. Booked hotel for 5 days.(@$148 per night). On my check in, told receptionist that I might extend for another 1 week due to work. Receptionist‚Äôs reply that it would be fine to extend one day prior to check out. One day before check out, told receptionist that I want to extend for another week (due to the location near to my meetings) , was being told it will be $185 per night. Reason given was that room rate will fluctuate due to occupancy. Why I was not being told so on my 1st day during check in , so that I could book for period of 12 days in total to make some savings?

2. Sound - whatever happened along the corridor (especially during vacuuming) and activities at the adjacent rooms, you could hear it loud and clear. Wonder what kind of sound insulation walls was fixed.

3. Do not disturb / clean up rooms hanging tag - the room was not provided with such tag. Door bell was being pressed now and then for cleaning.

4. 4 stars hotel rating - surprised that it was rated as 4 stars hotel (because it is new built up or lobby‚Äôs decor? ) on the internet with less than 2 stars in everything maybe except location. Perhaps it should be 2.5 to 3 stars to avoid misleading customers.

5. Lastly, with over 200 bad reviews and almost 200 terrible reviews. The replies from the guest relation department all are so generic it seems like telling you politely ‚Äúeither you take it or leave it, as we are not short of customers‚Äù

In the end, I extended just one more day so that I could have time to look elsewhere. Yes, I am one of those customers who will ‚Äúleave it‚Äù and good luck to those customers who will ‚Äútake it‚Äù. Writing this, not looking forward to your generic reply but forewarning others to lower their expectations on the hotel. 1st review on TripAdvisor - really unhappiness to the core.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"London, United Kingdom",2 ,1 ,1.0,

Date of stay: September 2018,ashleych0i,My First 1 Star Review,"I don't know if this hotel is considered a 4 or 3 stars hotel, but based on my experience, it is only worth a star, or negative if i was to compare it with all hotels that had stayed before, and here's why I had honored my first 1 star review to Hotel Boss.

Service:
For the first time, I received no reply from the hotel despite emailing them twice for additional room request and quires. I don't care if you are a 5 stars hotel or a 3 stars; replying an email to your guest is the most basic service, and your hotel staffs couldn't even deliver that?

Check-in:
Also for the first time, we were told that we need to call our booking agent to change to our full name by one of your staffs despite my partner showing him his office photo ID which clearly prove he is the person who booked the room. Let me be clear on this, I have used short name that includes my surname / first name in all hotel bookings whether they are local or overseas, and I have faced no issue in checking in. This is the first time we were stopped because the staff was afraid that we were 'fake' guests? He refused to look at my partner's office ID that his company had used to book the room under for clarification? Instead, he insisted we call the agent to add in his full name? We were able to check-in after the manager stepped in to let us through.

Room:
Smallest room we had stayed. Even smaller than the standard size hotel room in Japan. There's nothing much in the room. I think it really just meant to sleep and go. The bed is uncomfortable. The room wall is so thin that you can even hear the other guests opening their doors and walking out; definitely, disturbing. Somehow, the vibe or air in the room is very compressed and made us feel moody. This is the first time we wanted to return to our own room at home. Thank you for teaching us to appreciate our personal room more.

Room service:
Called for additional pillows. Waited for an hour and nothing was delivered. Called again and still no one came. Called for the third time and finally someone sent us our requests.

Even if someone was to pay me to stay in this hotel again, I will never take up the offer. I will recommend everyone to pay a few bucks more to opt for better budget hotel. However, if you insist on Hotel Boss, remember to book using your full name and spellcheck it, or risk getting accused of being a fake guest, and don't bother emailing them for confirmation as they will never reply.

We enjoyed our stay as we had a great view outside (swimming pool as well as Singapore Flyer) from the window and also the support staff was very helpful. Would like to give special mention to Mr Faizal (support staff) who was very warm with us esp. with our 1.5 yr old daughter who provided us home like feeling and was always there to provide any assistance we needed.

Only drawbacks are the room size is bit small (manageable) and the breakfast menu is same for all the days (could be improved by giving other varieities).

Overall its a very good place and highly recommended.

There is a caf√© and restaurant in the lobby. We only tried the caf√© which did nice drinks and snacks. There are also a few restaurants/ caf√©s next to the lobby.

Date of stay: September 2018,Adrian G,Great location close to the MRT,"Just completed a 5 night stay at this hotel (we left the day of the F1 grand prix). The hotel is large with over 1500 rooms and the lobby was always busy - day and night. The rooms are small by ny western standards, but they are modern clean and well-maintained daily. The hotel is in the suburb of Lavender which is a little away from the heart of Singapore and the hustle of places like Sentosa, but the MRT (subway train) station is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel and can easily get you anywhere you need to go quickly and cheaply. I recommend getting a Tourist Pass - they come in 1, 2 or 3 day options and the 3 day is only $30, of which $10 is a deposit you will get refunded in cash when you hand back the card. It gives you unlimited travel on the MRT and the local buses. Trains Run about every 5 minutes and are always on time. The Hotel Boss offers a breakfast option, however there are a multitude of breakfast options in and near the hotel, and the choices increase even more for dinner. The staff are friendly and helpful. The pool is reasonably large and well serviced with enough seating and lounges for a hotel of it's type. The fitness centre is small and basic, but in excellent condition.

Date of stay: September 2018,Tobin T,"Boss in Size, not in quality","I am not sure who came up with this weird name for a hotel or what was in their mind.
Decided to stay in this hotel after bad experience with another one the previous week.
Got a decent deal through one of the OTA and booked for few days.

This hotel is generally not bad, it gives a fair value for what you pay. This isn't the typical 4 star or 5 star experience that you may have from countries like Malaysia or Indonesia. The services and facilities are more utilitarian than luxury. Ideal for a short stay for business or a short holiday trip.

Pros :

1.Location, quite close to CBD and if you have stuff to be done around those areas.

2. Hotel itself has few eateries and coffee places in the same premise. I strongly recommend to try the ""Founders Bak kut teh"" just around the corner.

3. Very long reception and even though the hotel is over crowded most of the time, the very long reception counter with approx 20 staff ensure that the whole check-in and check-out wont take more than 5-10 mins

4. Reception staff is generally well trained

5. Good wifi connection, and each room has separate routers.

Cons:

1. Crowded, I mean like a temple which has some special puja kind of. Its people everywhere. If you are choosing this place to invite your business acquaintances to discuss stuff over a coffee, forget it, this is not the place for you.

2. Below average breakfast experience. Very limited options with quality of the food not to a 3-4 star hotel restaurant you may have experienced before. Again, its just utilitarian. If you are looking to just grab a few slice of bread with jam and butter, this may work.

3. I have come to a conclusion that size of hotel rooms in Singapore cant be a Con anymore, its just matchbox sized everywhere, so learn to live with it.

This hotel is more like a 4 star category sleep over. Come, check-in, sleep, have a mediocre breakfast and exit asap. Good for a 1-2 days stay and could be an ideal place for large groups on vacation. (I think that's what this hotel is built for, that's the whole logic.

Date of stay: September 2018,Experience813666,Suitable hotel for quick site seeing stay or a business trip ,"Stayed at Boss hotel for 3 nights to site see around Singapore before heading off to another holiday destination. The location of the hotel overall is really good, with the underground train (MRT) within 5 mins walking distance. We brought a tourist pass that covered us for unlimited travel for 3 days, which cost something around $30 at the train station. Personally I think it‚Äôs worth it and a hassle free option if your wanting to travel on and off the transport. Right by the train station entrance there are some little shops, newsagents, cafe to buy a drink or snack ... (fresh fruit for example) and there is a mc Donald‚Äôs, Burger King, and a subway open late. In boss hotel itself I didn‚Äôt book for a breakfast stay so I can‚Äôt comment on the food available but inside the hotel they did have a coffee shop/ cafe for your morning coffee or cake if your in a rush which I find helpful.

The room itself is small for 2 people. For example two people wouldn‚Äôt be able to walk past each other around the bed, there isn‚Äôt enough walk way space. But if your not spending time in the hotel room and literally just want to sleep it‚Äôs fine otherwise I‚Äôd find it too small of a space to relax in. Also the walls are not very sound proof. Especially when feeling a little jet lagged from the flight, trying to sleep was difficult. Overall all it was clean.
The bathroom I was overall happy with, it was a decent size, clean. The actual hotel itself was a pleasant surprise, much more of an attracted interior than I was expecting, with the pool also being fairly decent. But the weather was very unpredictable with outbursts of heavy rain for the time we arrived in Singapore, so not much time was spent at the pool.
Would I stay here again- yes. But only for a short visit no more than 3 days, and purely on the basis that I need a roof over my head.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,7 ,,,3.0

The front office guy Harvey was very helpful and supportive. Good thing they have a 24 hour gloria jeans coffee shop.  Breakfast is very average slightly dissappointng. Sometimes the lobby is so over crowded. I guess it should be a three property they don't deserve 4 star rating.  For the same price there should be more options easily available.

Funnily enough the only person that seemed to want to help was the new training staff. He was very nice and asked about our stay and seemed to be helping everyone with a smile. We got to our room and I was in shock at how tiny our room was me and my friend had to share a ‚Äúqueen‚Äù bed it was not a queen bed it was way smaller. The room is basically just the bed there is barley enough room for your bags we had to jump all over ours. The bathroom is so tiny don‚Äôt even give you proper toilet paper just tissues descender. And they give you 1 soft pillow the most uncomfortable sleep of my life!! If you wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable sleeping like that don‚Äôt do it to your paying customers! The walls are super thin so if you enjoy your sleep then you may wanna avoid this.

The Premium Balcony room not only includes a balcony for great views but also includes additional space between the bed and the window (also great views).

Date of stay: June 2018,Ting A,Terrible hotel,"First after we checked in, the toilet reeks of a strong and pungent smell. We thought the smell will dissipate after a while, but it stayed with us the entire trip.  The room was way too small and uncomfortable, the photos are rather deceiving. Perhaps they used ‚Äòwide‚Äô angels? In any case, it was way too small, and again reeks of the strong pungent smell.  The only redeeming factors are the pool and the view, which was panaromic and we could see the Singapore Flyer.  Then again, on the second day, the pool was filled up tourists of a certain race and it made me shudder a little.  All in all, a terrible experience and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

There is lots of food nearby, and you can easily walk to Little India or Bugis within 15 mins.

The walls are extremely thin. I was able to hear my friend brushing her teeth in the bathroom when I was sitting on my bed. It's easy to hear someone in the hallway or in the rooms near you. There is little privacy in the noise aspect, and you could very easily be disturbed by other guests. I did not have any problems sleeping, but a light sleeper could find it difficult to stay asleep.

The rooms are very small with no frills. There is only one body towel available for each person, no separate towel for hair or face. Amenities such as dental kit, hair dryer, shower gel and shampoo are provided, but you will have to bring your own comb. There is a safe but no wardrobe.

There is free wifi in the hotel lobby and in each room, which is easy to access.

Hotel staff are helpful, but there were some communication problems. I emailed ahead hoping to have all the rooms of my party arranged on the same floor, but the staff who replied to my email did not initially understand the request. Eventually, another staff member notified me that such arrangements would be made, but when we checked in, we found out that the rooms were on two different floors. We did not request alternative arrangements as we felt it was not that important. Asides from that, both check-in and check-out were very quick, no deposit needed.

Baggage storage is available at the lobby, and there is a counter which sells discounted tickets (discounts only apply when you buy tickets to two or more attractions, otherwise it is regular price) to many attractions such as Night Safari and Universal Studios.

There is a small pool and gym on the 4th floor, as well as a fresh orange juice machine that is worth trying out.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Hong Kong, China",270 ,105 ,3.0,

Awful breakfast.,"I was in such a rush to book a room I didn't check the reviews of it on TA and boy what a mistake that was. I only stayed the night because I didn't want to pack up and find another hotel after midnight.

This hotel had the absolute worst customer service, the worst check in experience, the rudest front desk staff, a dirty room, a broken safe, non-working AC (it was broken and they didn't fix it during my stay), and the absolute worst breakfast (they don't own the restaurant, but with it being SO TERRIBLE I don't know why they send customers there),

Management had an apologetic reply but it was empty words. They did and offered nothing to make it right. It angers me to have paid for a sleepless night along with the worst breakfast that made me sick, and the stress of having to deal with the front desk and management. It absolutely ruined my short time in Singapore. They should be ashamed of how poorly managed and run their hotel is. And an apology coupled with a ""we hope you give us another opportunity"" is insulting. I can't get that night back, they could at least give me my money back. But from seeing all the terrible reviews of this place, they would have to refund nearly all their guests.

I'm not a tall guy and yet I feel like my feet is already at the edge of the bed.

Don't be surprised seeing them laughing and chatting while on reception & even while talking on phone with guests. I must say the senior management staff are very well trained but you will not have the same experience with others.

My problem with the hotel is the very small room. Can't even open my luggage on the floor, had to place it on the bed.

Also, I am a business traveller. I can't help but sigh when I saw that the only 2 PCs provided for guests are located at the very very busy lobby at the cramped space next to the the tour counter, and don't even have proper stools. It's like an afterthought and not exactly an amenity.

I also used the 'laundry room' to iron my clothes. The 'room' is not an actual room in the first place. I suggest the hotel to provide more indicators of where exactly the 'room' is.

Date of stay: May 2018,Daniel,Better read this before you book your room here!,"We were 8 members looking for rooms for 7 nights in Singapore. We researched long and hard for rooms near MRT's (these are the local train stations using which you can travel anywhere in Singapore or most places with bus connectivity adding to the train). We zeroed in on to a few hotels but my friends who were researching with me were taken in by the gorgeous photos of the Hotel Boss, me on the other hand, like to read the single or double starred reviews to try and gauge how bad things can get. We finally took the plunge and booked rooms. It was two double rooms and 1 triple room.

1. We arrived at the hotel and luggage was take care of by the bell boys who held our baggage while we checked in.
2. The lobby is huge with ample seating and good air conditioning.
3. There are about 10-12 check-in counters and we found one immediately.
4. We had some trouble as they wanted the credit card to reflect each travellers name but it was taken care of.
5. We went to the luggage person and he explained that he will bring the baggage to one room and we will have to take the luggage to separate rooms. This is ridiculous and a blotch on hospitality. Maybe that is how they are trained but this definitely is not right. Considering he had the trolley, wonder what the problem was. We were not upset.
6. The room size definitely is a shocker. We had two big suitcases and there was nowhere to lay them.
7. You have a nice plush bed and about 2 feet on either side of the bed.
8. There is no wardrobe but few hangers are provided.
9. There is a rack where the kettle etc are kept, that can be used well by placing a small suitcase on it.
10. The TV is wall mounted.
11. The air conditioning works very well.
12. Wifi was good.
13. The bathroom has a sink, a commode beside it and a shower cubicle.
14. The shower is small but awesome. I am 97 KG, 6 feet and I did not find it a problem.
15. There is a rack above the sink and a huge mirror. The rack can be used well to set up toiletries.
16. The view from our window was pathetic, nothing but other rooms to see. The triple room had a city view.
17. We did not include breakfast but we did not feel $12 was worth the spread they had.
18. Our sink clogged and it took them 3 days and 5 calls to fix it. The exhaust in the triple room broke and it took them the same time.
19. We did not use room service. There is a pool on 4th Floor which we did not use.
20. Room cleaning is meticulous, it is done perfectly and bang on time.
21. USB power outlets are provided to charge devices, this was very convenient. Other plugs are also universal plugs, so did not need to use my adapter.
22. The Lavender MRT is about 8 minutes walk and it is a food hub, there is a hawker centre which has some great options, there is McDonalds and Burger king too.

Conclusion: It was a good stay over all for us. As we left the room at 9AM or earlier and returned past midnight every single day, we could not care less for the room size, yes, you do feel it sometimes when you are packing or moving in the room but that is not a deal breaker. This is a massive hotel with 1000 rooms and the fact that everything is close by. Arab street is 7 minutes walk, Mustafa shopping centre is 15 min walk, Little India the same. Cabs using Grab app arrive in less than 5 minutes. The points listed in conclusion are the reasons for my rating.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Havelock North, New Zealand",528 ,94 ,4.0,

Called the hotel in the morning of the 21st May, the person who attended the call named Lin was rather reluctant to reply my queries. I mentioned the email which I had put in my request however she claimed there was no such email received. Did not greet on the phone and hung up the call sounding unhappily. First impression of the front desk upon check in - sloppy! A whole row of front desk but none with professional looks Nor hospitality ethics. Requested a high floor but was given a room at level 8 (pretty high ?) Room had a weird smell that of a talcum powder. TV wasn‚Äôt working at all! Called the operator the first time and she said to reset the cards - yet again they really don‚Äôt know how to speak to guest. Sent someone to check and even after TV reset, the TV wasn‚Äôt working. Called operator again and this time she was like irritated that I mentioned about it again, said they will change the room for us. And I believe there is a way of telling hotel guest nicely on the change etc. Was rude and yet again was not bothered her reply was as if I was troubling her. Shifted to room at level 17 - the moment we entered it had a smoked cigarette smell filling up the room. It was so bad! We were so disgusted. Air con was not good even tho we set the temperature at 17 deg, we were feeling humid at night! No bin in the toilet (where do you expect us to throw our tissues, sanitary towels etc?) I would not recommend this hotel to Locals for staycation unless you‚Äôre on a last  plan with a budget but even so, there are much better hotels. The only advantage was the late check out at 3pm given due to booking made via website, that‚Äôs about it. Over - crowded lobby mainly with Indian nationals and Chinese. Definitely not a recommendable place for a staycation for locals. Moreover the price is steep for such a Budget hotel, guest service that lacks training and mannerism.

Singapore was our first stop on a girls vacation with my toddler, so we were extremely jetlagged. Staying up late at night we spent some time in the lobby where I realized there's definitely an escort service operating out of the lobby after hours. Men come in ladies disappear and come back and return to their seats. Its all very discreet and the women are dressed like regular women enjoying an evening out. The front desk seems to be in on it so it doesn't feel sketchy and you'd have to be sitting in the lobby long enough to notice, but its totally going on which made me uncomfortable to enjoy that common space with my child late at night.
The pool level lacks lights so a late night play at their sparce playground was out of the question. Since the pool is not closed off I wish the area was lit at night, as its a lovely place to strolll with a jet lagged toddler.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Brooklyn, New York",4 ,,4.0,

When I made this booking I looked at all the options of rooms and decided to pay a little more for a room with a balcony.  On the website it showed a spectacular skyline view.  I have sent two requests to the hotel to ask for a good view.  They replied twice that it can only be confirmed at the time of arrival.  I was so disappointed when I got the room and it was on the 7 floor and looking into the courtyard of the building.  No view.  I can however say that we were allowed an early check in at about 11h00.  This was great.  On our way back from Bali we stayed there again. (Still the best vallue for money)  This time we got a room also with balcony as per my booking, and I asked the super efficient lady at reception that I really want a view so badly.  I was not disappointed this time.....wow!!!  Spectacular!  Rooms are overal small so this hotel is perfect for a 2/3 night stay over.  It is very central.  Taxis, busses are freely available.  No need to arrange with hotel for pick up from the airport as the taxi system in Singapore is fantastic.  Everyone knows Hotel Boss.  Taxis work with a meter system so don‚Äôt worry about the charges.  Check out was at 12h00.  They kept our luggage safe until we had to go to the airport that night.  Whatever you want to arrange they are so efficient.  Breakfast was perfect for the 12 S Dollars.  This is a very busy hotel but the best feature is the absolutely lovely swimming pool area on the 4 floor.  We enjoyed that a lot. Reception also great to assist with taxi‚Äôs, postcards and restaurants.  They recommended Swee Choon Tim Sum.......that was a great local experience!

6. I have never seen breakfast as pathetic as this hotel. There was no live egg counter, no boiled eggs, no brown breads.

I found the staff to be warm and friendly and eager to help. The rooms are very well maintained and clean though very small. But you are not in Singapore to watch TV in your room are you? The one peeve I had with the rooms is that the walls are paper-thin and noise from the corridors and neighboring rooms carries easily. However, this is a great location to see Singapore from. There is a bus stop practically outside the front of the hotel and a metro stop nearby. Also, within a few minutes walk, you will find the shopping area of Burgis, Arab street and other malls.

It was awful.   The ""restaurant"" was a dirty, dark miserable room  and the expensive food was just not worth it.   The upper halal restaurant food was better but as we could not get drink there it was no real substitute.

There are plenty of food options around this place.

The room is small... Superior Double is 14 m¬≤/151 ft¬≤.
Size didn't matter to us as we are only a couple and also we got the city view. Also, rooms are very clean, comfortable and nice.
(But don't know how you can manage with kids in such a small room.)

Date of stay: October 2017,Yoong N,Wasn't expecting this.,"So this came as a surprise on how brand new and pretty this place is. I remember looking at hotels on Expedia and there was a lot of 'Hotel Boss' or 'Boss Hotel' chain in singapore and I did not like it one bit for my budget, so I opt to up my budget a bit more and just booked this one. With no expectation what so ever, my taxi driver dropped us off outside their lobby and I asked him are you sure this is Hotel boss? and he looked at the address I provided and replied with a Yes. The lobby is grand and is crowded with so many people, service was fast tho. and yes I was indeed booked into this hotel.

Reason I chose this hotel was because it look modern, and that it was close to the station, about 5-10 mins walk. and the train goes directly to the airport (you might need to get off one stop and wait for another train but it is the same line)

The room was small - average, if you ever stayed at Red Planet hotels in Philippines its the exact same size, its a room with all the necessity to just sleep and shower comfortably and don't stay there too long you might feel claustrophobic. Very clean and modern tho, they have a outdoor pool area on one of the levels, towels are provided there as well, but Singapore weather is so icky that you just want to stay indoor, so we didn't bother and at night it was full with other guests.

Our taxi told us that the Bak Tuk Teh connected to the hotel is very famous, but we didn't have time to try, but further down we discovered on our last day there was a hawker style centre that has the famous Tien Tien hainese chicken (from maxwell centre) and other food stores there.

Stayed here for 4 nights, we didn't get housekeeping, we called them up to change our towels, there wasn't much service required here because we were out every day.

All in all, if you want a cheap place to stay and close to transport and away from the busy crowd of orchard road, then this is the place.

also DON'T go to LEGOLAND is a waste of time, a run down theme park.

Two of our party shared a twin room which was VERY compact and was a struggle to fit them, two suit cases and their clothing in. The hanging space is limited.

I up graded to a Premier room with a balcony on the 13th floor. A very wise choice if staying more than a couple of nights.
The hotel was clean and well organised. The reception staff were very young but were very professional dealing with any problems. The staff organising taxis and the lobby were very frie fly towards us.
Several disappointments to highlight. As in previous reviews the breakfast is the same every day. There are several eateries around the hotel so is an option. You only get bath towels no hand towels are available.
The biggest disappointment was due to a late flight we had to pay a full nights rate to keep a room on to shower and change in. Not a problem until the key cards were canceled on more than one occasion which then led to many visits to reception to sort out.

There are a lot of food along the way such as McDonald‚Äôs, Old Chang Kee which sells fried food, Food courts, bubble tea etc.

At the hotel lobby, there are still a lot of cafe and food court selling local delicacies.

The lobby is always packed with people due to its close proximity to Bugis and Town. Bugis only 1 station away while City Hall is 2 stations away.

The room is cozy for 2 persons stay. However it does not provide slippers and it can get cold. Only 2 pillows which might not be sufficient for some.

Room is equipped with basic such as toiletries and 2 bottles of mineral water and coffee/tea.

Firstly the room was a box room, there was literally no space. There is also no drawers or places to put your cases so really not practical.

The staff at the front desk were not particularly welcoming and when we asked for more coffee in the room from the cleaner we got dirty looks!

At night, if I cannot sleep early, I can walk to the 24 hours Mustafa Centre and Jalan Besar for my supper. There are many nearby places where the visitors can eat.

Upon checking-in, the receptionist was very courteous and informed me that I can check out at 3pm because I booked the room directly in their hotel website. Likewise, a chinese gentlemen in the receptionist was also very courteous when I checked out.

Although the room is small but it has a great view given the cheap rates that I was paying. Having no cupboard to hang my clothes was not an issue at all as the hangers were designed to be an open concept. The air conditioning and the water heater were in perfect condition. Inside the room, there are electric kettle, mineral water, coffee, tea, sugar and milk powder. The toiletries were also sufficient.

Date of stay: March 2018,Nnitin6336,I still have to stay here for a week,"Let's start with the goods, the location is nice. The exterior of the hotel is great and sets your expectations of amazing stay. However

Cons .
1. Breakfast
A. Closes at 10.30 , with people still at the tables they stop replenishing at 10.20 and the waiters are stern and give a close ended reply "" 10.30 breakfast close,so no more"" . I have been travelling for business quite a lot around the world and the first time seen a request for buffet food being turned down when you are 1. Min late.
B.Menu - same menu for the last 3 days , preparation is far from avegare and seems no effort is done to get quality or flavour.

2. Rooms
A. Small is an understatement
B. No cutlery in the room, which is the strangest thing again, they don't provide any cutlery in the room and always adviced to buy from the nearest 7'11
C. No iron - another thing, when travelling for work you need to have an iron in the room and the same is not provided. Howe d. they have a common iron place on the 4th floor where you you can take your clothes, now you can't take your room hangers as obviously those are the ones that are locked and the whole task makes you feel like a dry cleaner carrying clothed to different floors.
E. The laundry service is also missing and has a common vending machine for that. Now when travelling for work one needs to keep receipts. The reception refused any reciept for the 20 dollors I have spend washing my own clothes. They don't keep manual reciept book also. Strange.
F. Thinnest ways possible. To an extent I can hear my neighbour flush everytime he takes a dump.
G. No ventilation in the washrooms , so you live in the stink of your washroom so that can't be good stall.

Overall it's a cheap ( not that cheap if you compare ) for all travellers however if I had known I would have rather prefferably an Airbnb over this hotel.

Date of stay: March 2018,AnneA57,I liked the pool ...,"I liked the pool, which was one of only a few good things I have to say about the Boss Hotel. The pool itself was a good, refreshing activity to combat Singapore's heat and humidity. However, please, employ someone to be in attendance, at least intermittently, to clean up the mess left by other swimmers.
Good point number 2 is location. Situated between Lavender and Bugis MRT stations and within walking distance of Little India and the Arab Quarter with lots of shops and eating places to choose from. Number 3, great views if you are lucky enough to have a room facing anywhere other than the atrium (looking at other people's rooms and balconies, isn't a view).
Ok, so now for the negatives ....
Tiny rooms, especially those without the added balcony. There wasn't even a bedside table in our twin room. There looked like there was enough room for one but then I realised that there would be nowhere for a second suitcase to sit/lie (only enough room for one suitcase stand). Needless to say, rooms too small for any kind of cupboard although there was a kind of hanging rod but good luck being able to hang anything longer than a shirt. Also, only one bed had the facility of a power outlet. Just didn't feel like much thought had been given to the small details.
Floors were dirty and why does it seem too much effort to clean the grout in the bottom of the shower? ... the teeny, tiny shower I might add where you constantly hit the tap resulting in scalding/cold water or turning it off completely.

So my aunt, bless her cotton socks, accidentally booked a non-refundable/non-changeable rate at Hotel Boss for our stay this month (her, my uncle and my mum) which was fine as it was one of the properties we were looking at due to the location. And the location is fantastic - plenty of food options in the hotel and close by, near to Little India, Bugis and transport.
What is not fantastic is:
- Welcome from reception staff. The receptionist we had was thoroughly uninterested, barely looked us in the face and said 5 words total to us. I know you're a big, busy hotel but you're still in primarily a service industry.
- My aunt had emailed months ago using the details on the hotel website to ask if our rooms could be allocated on the same floor and close to each other. She never got a response, and the hotel allocated us on different floors on opposite sides of the hotel. Even though they are different room types, not to receive any sort of reply or explanation is poor.
- I'll be lying on a concrete slab when I die, I don't want to when I'm on holidays - mattress and pillow super uncomfortable.
- Power point at one bed but not the other in twin room. At least it is an opportunity for one of us to have to force ourselves to get up to turn off an alarm, but in this day and age even older hotels are updating their access to power to make it more convenient.
- Hotel room floors are filthy. We had just spent 5 nights in Penang on old hotel floors and our feet didn't turn as black as they have after 1 night here.
- Add some sign posting on level 4 for the laundry. It's not mentioned anywhere.

Now some good things about the hotel:
- Location
- Plenty of food/drink options close by, and convenience shops
- Views from the rooms that actually have views are amazing, especially at night.

The lobby area is really nice. We arrived at hotel at 8am but check in isn‚Äôt until 2pm however the staff were nice enough to give us a room right away which we highly appreciated! When we got to our room the first thing we noticed is how tiny it is. I saw someone‚Äôs review describe it like a prison cell and I‚Äôd have to second that. The rooms feel newly renovated so that was ok. The bath room was nice just small. There was a small stain on the blanket.

The room was tiny but it still has everything you need so we were happy with it. We had a lovely first nights rest and when we got back to the room it was tidied, fresh towels and bottles of water/coffee/tea were replaced. Housekeeping staff were lovely. The subsequent nights however were terrible and we experienced the thin cardboard walls. Our neighbours were up ALL night talking from about 12am-7am and it felt like they were literally right next to me talking. It was SO loud it was ridiculous.

Pool area is nice, good views and big pool. The gym is small and awkward as it‚Äôs in a glass box looking out to the pool and people can watch you workout.

The hotel is in a convenient location, it is in between 3 train stations on different lines (blue, green, orange) which makes it super easy to get around. Easy to get to from Changi airport. There is a food court literally right next door which is pretty cheap and delicious. It is a short walk to the golden mile tower where you can get busses to Malaysia. The location of Hotel Boss would have to be the best part of the stay for me.

Hotel Boss would‚Äôve gotten a ‚ÄòVery Good‚Äô rating from me if it wasn‚Äôt as noisy as it was.

It is conveniently located close to the CBD and most tourist attractions, taxis are easily available, there is a really good food court and 2 restaurants in the building, (not part of the hotel). Plus several eatries and other food courts a short walk in any direction.

ALL rooms are the same - I checked the fire safety floor plan.

Our room comprises a double bed, 42cm of space either side, and 91cm of between the foot of the bed and the wall. The shower is 90x70cm, and it is very difficult to get clean without perpetually nudging the faucet and scolding yourself. I would include pictures, but would need a fisheye lens to be able to photograph anything more than a blank wall.

There's no room to put our cases down, so they stand between the bed and the window blocking one side of the bed. To retrieve clothes, we have to put them on the bed retrieve what we want, close them up and then put them back. Obviously there is no wardrobe because there is no space for one!

Once we finally got past the bulldogs and up to what we thought were going to be rooms we were then struck by the fact that the rooms were about the size of your average prison cell, this is no joke, if we wanted something out of our suitcases we had to put them on the bed to open them. No toilet roll only those little single sheet dispensers you would expect to find in a train toilet not a supposed 4 star hotel. We had no hot water and when I phoned down to complain the bulldogs replied ""We know there is an issue with the hot water heater for that floor"" no apology, no attempt to move us, nothing! Then to top it all off for 2 nights in a row we were woken up by what I can only describe as a Chinese school trip running up and down the outside the corridor shouting, this was both times in the early hours of the morning. So we had the rest of the week we were due to stay refunded and went and booked an actual 4 star hotel The Parkroyal (Please see my review for this hotel)

Had to request more than one pillow per bed, as clearly illustrated on their brochure no problem but to provide more than one towel per person clearly was.

Checked twice with staff day before that taxis would be queuing at 6am the next morning...no problem we were assured. Guess what, big problem.

Reception staff were miffed that I had the audacity to ask for a room change but grudgingly gave us a different room however we could smell cigarette smoke daily when walking down the corridor to the lifts. the noises from each room were way above a satisfactory level and at one stage we had to ask a lady to talk a tad softer when making a mobile call directly outside of our room door.

Date of stay: February 2018,nimajavanbakht,so so hotel!,"We were having a 4night trip to Singapore. I decided to say what I can do to help travelers (I know its long but it worth it!)
The hotel is priced well and new. From the outside and lobby it can be like a 4* hotel but when you go up I'll give it 3* (Maybe a 3*T). The reception is about 10 persons, some of them is so kind. It's by your chance to get a good one! but generally they are helpful. We were having 1585 (twin with no view) and 1520 (a double with city view) on the 15th floor. They won't take you any deposit. The view was truly nice though it seems our booking was without a city view, We were get one of rooms with that feature. Elevators was plenty and fast. The rooms as it is appears is too small but clean. you'll have house keeping everyday and will have a water (though the water is drinkable in Singapore) and coffee and tea. it has good wifi for rooms and lobby. there is a safety box and hairdryer in a slide and off course a refrigerator. The air conditioner is good too. The bed is comfy but so simple with a small pillow. it could be much better. it has tooth kit and shampoo and soap in the toilet and you can ask them slippers to give you by calling to 0. a bad point is that room to room feature on the phone won't work!
The toilet doesn't have water hose. The shower is so short and I couldn't easily take a shower due to the problem. also the water went to toilet area after some minutes. Another big bad point is that, if your neighbors were in the room and make noises you will here as much as they are in your room! But fortunately our neighbors was silent mostly. Generally The room is basic. For us as we were going to the city from 9AM - 11PM its ok cause we were going to room as a tired one and we just need some sleep but if you want to use hotel more, go for better choices -although they are expensive in Singapore-.
The breakfast, I suggest you to use the Halal breakfast on 4th floor. It's so simple again. 2-3 kinds of fruits like watermelon and orange. the juices is just made from sugar and water and not so good. the menu is simple too. you can have scrambled egg and some chicken ham or sausages. Sometimes you can find Kaya Jam too. The breakfast is for a 3* hotel.
Swimming pool and Gym was interesting and it seems it looks good though we couldn't use it. The tour guide in the corner of the hotel is kind and has nice informations and sometimes the ticket prices can be better if you bought from her (Though I take everything by myself cause some family pax and student pass will have a discount). Also don't forget that buying tickets online with Visa card can sometimes give you extra discounts on their websites. The money exchange near the hotel is not a good deal. It gives us about 129 or 130 Singapore dollars for 100 USD (Although better than airport and some touristic attractions ) but you can easily find 132 or 133 rate for 100USD in Little India. If you need exchange by emergency and that was closed walk to Lavender and look for V-hotel Exchanger or walk to Arab St and you can find that 130 rates there as well.

The hotel is near MRT and I really recommended you to use MRT with purchasing EZ-LINK cards from the MRT stations for your journeys (You need one for each person) and for choosing the routes you can use ""SingaporeGo"" app on iPhone. The Lavender MRT is about 3minutes walk in your left and also you can enjoy some food like Burger King / Subway / McDonald's / some bakeries and more that they are well priced too. For example a BigMc meal is about 7.95$. If you turn right from lobby hotel and walk about 10-15 minutes, you will get at Bugis MRT station too. Also the Bugis has some shopping centers and more food centers as well to choose. The prices is good near the Bugis as well and you can get a chinatown feeling too. Also the Arab St and Sultan Mosque is near the hotel and you can get there by 7 minutes walking. it worth to visit but generally I don't like so much and the food was there was pricey. Don't forget the Singapore MRT price is based on the Kilometers you will journey, so the lower one is better for your pocket. The EZ-LINK is 12SGD that 5SGD cannot be refunded and is the card price. you have 7SGD in your card for traveling and the minimum charge for each time is 10SGD. each trip will be about 0.7SGD to 2SGD based on your journey with this card and is 50% less than a regular ticket. Also you can use this card for example on Mandai Khatib Shuttle for going to Singapore zoo, or you can use it in all the McDonald's to order.

I would recommend this hotel for travelers like us -Cause Singapore itself is lovely to visit- that they need just night sleep and well price. Tough it depends on your chance for view or neighbors noises.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Stockholm, Sweden",7 ,30 ,3.0,
Date of stay: February 2018,happytraveller085,Very basic,"As others have mentioned, the rooms are very small. I was in a 'superior twin room' and really for two people it was a squeeze, and the saying
'living out of a suitcase' is spot on for this hotel. There were three drawers in the small unit on which the kettle etc sits. One drawer was completely filled with the room safe. One partially because it contained a hair dryer which couldn't be removed, so leaving one drawer. No cupboards for hanging clothes, only a rail with six coathangers. Bathroom although small just about does. I used the level 1 'restaurant' once only. The food isn't bad with a decent choice of hot/cold but for 12 dollars its not worth the hassle. Very basic seating and although I had left a drink to 'mark' my spot found a family had sat down at that table anyhow. Understand that at certain times you have to hang around to get a seat.
However I have to say I found the staff perfectly okay and happy to answer any questions. I had requested if early check in possible as arriving from an overnighter and was given access to our room at 1000 for no extra surcharge - definite kudos for that. Hotel is within short walking distance of three MRT stations, and the Bugis shopping complex 10 mins away. Plus bus stop right outside front of hotel.

It‚Äôs very easy to get to, to get the train from the airport it‚Äôs straightforward and then just a 5 minute walk from the station. Giant air-conditioned lobby but they definitely overuse the air freshener/perfume.

When we checked in it turns out that the online agent had booked the wrong type of room. This is nothing to do with the hotel but when we were sorting the issue the check in guy helping us just pointed at the lobby phone and essentially brushed us off. So it wasn‚Äôt that he was unhelpful and I get his hands were tied, but he was very unfriendly and unsympathetic to 2 travellers who‚Äôd arrived off a 13hr flight.

The rooms themselves are small straight and boxy, and the set up is such that even a premiere room with a balcony doesn‚Äôt offer more light or space. The balcony is just another ‚Äúroom‚Äù so there‚Äôs no windows to it, you just have a solid wall and a door you open. One door for the bathroom, one door for the balcony. But the rooms were clean and functional.

Breakfast is packed every morning as it is such a large hotel, I‚Äôd recommend going for the halal breakfast as it‚Äôs on a different floor and has more choice, the main one doesn‚Äôt do pork anyway so there‚Äôs nothing missed out. The pool was a nice size and the location of it gives it lots of heat and sun. The ""gym"" was 3 treadmills and a crosstrainer.

The famous founder bah kut teh and Tian Tian chicken rice are just 2 minutes walk away from the hotel which is a great plus.

The room was pretty small but clean and with a large window so you won't feel claustrophobic.

Our first room unfortunately, was on the 5th floor- 1 level above restaurants and there must've been a gas leak as by nightfall our room was filled with kitchen smell and it was totally disgusting. I called for room service and was asked to go down to the reception where I was asked to go up again to wait while they send someone up (Probably could have sent someone up before asking us to go up and down multiple times). After the problem has been verified the staffs at the reception was still rather nonchalant and rather than being apologetic, it feels to me that they seem rather irritated that they have to deal with this problem as it was late midnight; regardless they gave us another room upon my request.

Date of stay: January 2018,June S,Good Location,"We have just returned from Singapore having stayed 7 nights at the Hotel Boss. The hotel was large but with 10 receptionists check in and out was quick. Yes the rooms were small but they were clean. My room unfortunately was near the lifts and therefore very noisy as people were arriving all night. I found opening the door and asking people having loud conversations in the hall to be quiet ( 2.30am) worked.
Location was great and we used the Lavender MRT all the time and also for out lunch/evening meals.
My one big disappointment was the breakfast which was just boring. There was only one toast machine working so gave up on having that. There was a sign saying that if you wasted food, you would be charged $5, which is fair enough. However, my son's partner, who had paid for breakfast, filled up her very small water bottle from the water cooler. She was shouted at and was made to pay $5 for the water. There was no sign to say this couldn't be done so how was she to know that this was against the rules?
After this event we took our custom elsewhere where the food was better, better choice and no body shouting at you.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Napier, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand",5 ,3 ,4.0,

The same could not be said for the double room which faced a wall a metre away.  In both rooms there was not enough room to place our cases to open them.  Bathrooms were tiny with not enough shelf space- you needed to be a contortionist to reach the loo paper as it was behind you at head level (due to no space).In the six days we stayed the soap was not replaced once.  We spoke to reception on our second day about our safe which didn't work & our shower head which wouldn't stay up.  We were told they would look into it but neither were fixed during our stay. Bed was very hard and pillows terrible.   We requested two extra pillows and these were no better.  Cleaning was sub-par with coffee cups left unwashed & it appeared like a quick dash through to make beds & change towels only.

Free daily water is a real bonus in this humid climate.
The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in bar my own - no soft pillow tops and excess pillows
One downside is no wardrobe and only one drawer

The room we were given was very small, the floorspace available was used up by our 2 cases, which made staying here quite a chore, particularly accessing the bathroom, as the door for this opened outwards so getting in meant tripping over and repositioning our cases on to the bed.
We didn't include breakfast initially, but decided we wanted this on our 2nd morning, so went to the restaurant, and were sent to reception to add it to our room and pay for it there and then, which although inconvenient, it did take a lot of time, more than necessary, this is meant to be a business hotel, not sure why it couldn't have been added to the room and billed for at checkout. The breakfast also turned out to be a waste of money as it was very poor in terms of choice, quality & value for money, we opted to eat breakfast elsewhere the next day.
The bed was comfy though, the location of the hotel was good, it was easy to get an Uber from, the gym very basic but the pool looked ok.

The problem is,,the hotel has thin wall. I can hear the room next to me took a bath or using the bathroom. I cann hear people talking or moving things. The room is small,,average size for singapore. But what pissed me off is on the 9 th Evening after I went back to the hotel, the housekeeping did not sweep the floor. So I can see many of my hair from yesterday and all the small dirt on the floor. They practically did not clean the floor. I stayed in room 0701.

1. Location was great as it was near the Kampong Glam/Arab St area where u can find cafes/bars/rest in abundance. Nearby bus and mrt stops.

2. Quite a number of eateries within hotel premises including a food court and convenience store (Cheers).

3. Food court has 2 halal stalls serving western fare (Tenderfresh) and Smashed Chicken Rice (Uncle Penyet)

4. Clean hotel room with a nice city view and smart TV.

5. Fast check-in maybe due to the fact that they have 8 counters.

6. At least 6 lifts at both lift lobbies so you didnt need to wait too long.

Cons :

1. Triple room was rather small.

2. Toilet has no bidet or water spray for you to clean up, so it could be a problem for Muslims.

Date of stay: December 2017,Himanshu G,Worst ever hotel stay experience across the globe,"Nothing except for the location is what I can say we liked about this property. To start with the staff is exceptionally rude to deal with guests. There are hardly any amenities in available in the room, rather we would say even the room space is scarce. We thankfully changed our booking to a premier room with balcony else would have surely regretted our choice 100%.

During our stay one day, at breakfast, one of the guests walked out to attend to an emergency call leaving his wife & kid at the restaurant, the was being polite enough to not attend the call while other guests were taking their breakfast. While we were standing to give our details to the restaurant manager to start our breakfast, she was very rudely asking this guest to pay up for re-entry citing the sign boards stating he should have informed her before going out of the restaurant. Though we do understand the same however, being an employee of a hotel she should have considered his polite request and not be rude with him when he proved the point that his wife and kid were sitting there.

Another instance, being vegetarians, my wife requested them to heat some vegetarian food that we were carrying as the choice of breakfast was not good enough, they refused, but VERY VERY Rudely. We were fine with not getting our request accepted, however, the rude behaviors are not acceptable from any standpoint. On top of that, they started talking to each other in their language which we couldn't understand but could surely make out that they very talking about us being fools or something like that. It was a nightmare to stay at this property and would never in our life again will we choose this property to stay ever in Singapore.

Everything as stated above except for the location being very central. Absolutely not recommended. I am not sure, if we can actually request a refund for such a bad experience but would surely love to get a complete refund from these guys if possible. We had no choice therefore, we ended up completing our 3 night stay at this property else we would have surely moved out right after the first night itself.

They talk to the guest as if they are doing a BIG favor to them for letting them stay in their hotel. Absolutely disrespectful attitudes conferred upon the guests by the staff.

They don't even provide for plates and cutlery to the guests in room if requested for they turn around and say they don't have it. For god sake, why are they even running this hotel boasting about largest number of rooms in whole of Singapore.

The room sizes say it all as to how they managed maximum number of rooms in the whole city.

Another MRT station, Bugis, is not too far away on the other
side of the road. There are also many old food establishments all around the hotel and within walking distance.

The main business of this hotel must be associated with mass-tourism because the huge reception lobby is always filled with large groups of rowdy tourists who are brought in droves by busloads and that explains why this hotel has a floor specially designated for coaches in the building itself. There is a long reception counter and also two lift towers with many lifts to cater for it.

Check-in was terribly inefficient and slow and when we had some problem with Agoda's misrepresentation about breakfast which was advertised when booking but denied when checking in, the manager on duty was ineffective and rudely refused to offer any help to resolve the matter with Agoda. The unprofessional attitude of the manager & staff at reception was one of the downside of this hotel and seldom seen in the service industry anywhere.

The hotel room was clean but too small and the bathroom was even tinier. Facilities in the bathroom were basic minimum and shower pressure was weak. Bed and pillows were thin and not comfortable, but air-conditioning okay. There was no space for any wardrobe & there's no ironing facilities in the room. Furthermore the room walls were not sound-proof and voices and shouts could be heard from the corridor in the wee hours and also the shrieks and groans from the neighbours were also not spared.

Level 4 is a nice and wide open terrace with smoking areas and you can find the restaurant, a half-sized swimming pool, a small fitness centre, a laundromat with some coin-operated washing machines and driers at $5 per use and also two shared ironing boards for guests besides a number of cozy sitting areas spread around the floor.

No answer was made from your part to indicate that you did not provide this service. I was told that you could not reach me since I booked via booking.com, I don't think so. Anyway.
¬†
On our arrival, before the payment, I asked again about the baby cot to be ready in the room, I was told ""Ok sir"". When we got to the room, there was no baby cot (of course not), so I called the reception and only at this moment I was told about your policy: ‚ÄúWe do not have baby cots sir‚Äù. The only solution I was offered was to be upgraded in a room with a simple bed for my daughter. Come on, seriously? A 8 month baby in a single bed? We were then told to leave the hotel and that a refund would be done which I accepted without any drama about the whole situation.¬†
¬†
The day after, seeing that I had not been refund, I came to your hotel once again to have a document from you so I could turn to my bank and ask them to see if it was normal and in the process but like I told already, your guest relation manager told me to write an email to you, which I did. I received an answer from you asking some more details about the booking that you already had and I gave them to you once more. Since then, no answer. This is my 4th email and still, no answer, no refund!!!!

Is this standard policy from your company to charge guests and offering them refund that you don't deliver? I could understand it can take time to process but I don't understand and I don't appreciate that you don't answer to emails.

Date of stay: November 2017,patrickkww,You get what you pay for,"Well, to write a review about Hotel Boss is actually challenging as opinions about it are so different. When we entered the hotel everything looked like luxury, but when you see the room it is of course not.
We go often to Singapore, sometimes to shop there, but sometimes we only stop there on the way to/from Australia. In that case we came from Australia and wanted to spend some nights in a hotel with a swimming pool, but did not really want to spend too much money on the hotel, as Australia itself is already so expensive. So when Singapore is not the major destination of the holiday I would always come back here. There is a swimming pool, the location is very good as Lavender MRT station is just about 200m from the hotel, you can also easily walk to Bugis. The room is VERY small, some might even get problems when you have claustrophobia. It was difficult to be with 3 suitcases in the room. But everything you need is in it, it is just really small. The pool looks very nice, but it is only 1,2m deep, which is not a real pool in my eyes, feels more like a pool for children.
But, you have to see the price. The rate is so cheap compared to other hotels with this location in Singapore. We even booked one more night, just that we can keep our room for complete day as our plane left at midnight. For that hotel rate you cannot ask for more, and that makes it really acceptable. I would do it again, when going from/to Australia. I would not book it for a holiday only in Singapore...
Even Internet is provided free of charge, and it was a very convenient connection. Disturbing was also that there was no ""Do not disturb""sign.

On arrival I was impressed with the modern look and feel of the hotel.  It was very clean in all areas. We were greeted by the friendly reception staff who rapidly got us checked in and up to our room.Our twin room was very clean with a modern feel to it, but unfortunately it was far too small to be practically used, as only one of us could really stand up at a time, while the other was forced to lay on the bed., or wait in the small bathroom.  Plus there was nowhere to put our second suitcase.  so we had to place it on the floor and step over it.    The room was quite dark because the window looked out to small walled off area and straight across literately into another guests room.  We could see them moving around inside and I pretty sure they could see us, so we had to keep the blind permanently closed.   The WIFI was nice and fast but  it went down for a few hours one afternoon/evening.The outside pool area was very nice, large and clean, but when we visited it , it was just far too busy and noisy to relax.  And some of the guests were mis-using the life rings as pool toys.Breakfast was in a separate cafe around two minutes‚Äô walk from the hotel, and it was very nice indeed with great choices of food and drink on offer, with a very friendly helpful lady working there.I arrived back to the hotel in my Uber one afternoon, and the concierge seemed to be quite rude to my driver.

How I see it this hotel is booked by travel agents for group tours, hence the staff is also indifferent to the needs to individual requirements and service, they know they will still get the business.

On entering the guest meeting and reception area oozes glamorous yet sophisticated with a wow factor.

The staff on entering rushed to help with baggage and were friendly and welcoming.

The room was smaller than expected but cosy. All amenities you could expect were included and a washing service and drying service were available on 4th floor at a cost. The iron and ironing board was free.

The room was very clean and satisfactory. Everything worked in the room accordingly.

The only negative about the room was the TV didn't have very many channels at all.

The hotel offers a gym on fourth floor and a pool and breakfast area‚Äã.

The hotel is perfectly located near the subway and the many segments of malls. Bugis plus is home to some great shops and a cinema a walk away.

Taxis stop routinely outside the hotel through the doors of the lobby area.

The taxis here are usually quite cheap but to maximise benefits choose comfort cabs. They start at a lower rate.

The hotel is prime because you can get to the docks from the hotel quite easily, bugis malls, the merlion statue, cat cafe, we are the furballs dog cafe, cinema, bars and food outlets and much more by walking.The taxis can take you to the zoo and tree top adventures and universal studio. Its not really far at all.

We had a panic moment where I left my phone in a taxi and I didn't feel some of the staff on the reception were taking me seriously but ""Fiona"" stepped in and took charge and got my phone back to me safely.

The staff were very helpful with information on how to get around and what there is to do in this wonderful city. As requested, the staff will give you a map of Singapore and the MRT subway map for free. The hotel was recently built, so it has a modern feel to it. The guest rooms are clean but not very spacious. Comfortable but not much room to walk around. For our size family of 3 it was fine. Most of our days in Singapore we spent discovering the countries culture so a small room was only for resting at night. If we needed more room to stretch out we would hang out on our balcony in our superior double room. At your convenience there is a refrigerator to keep your refreshments cool if needed. The private bathroom offers a few free toiletries such as a toothbrush, q-tips, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and a shower cap. Not only are free products delightful but the floors are made with a smooth pine tiles and the shower has a transparent glass shower door.

But I feel there is a lot lacking, otherwise this hotel could be highly recommended for budget travelers. Let me put it in point form:

Pros:
-New and clean modern hotel, premium decor in a budget hotel

-Fairly cheap and a great location

-Large view window with window blinds

-Good WIFI connection

Cons:
-Tiny Room (This is standard for most Singapore budget hotels)

-Check-out time is ridiculous: 11am with SGD $30 for each additional hour

-Room are not sound proof; I could hear the LOUD chinaman and his whole family spitting and clearing their throats in the morning! Pray that you don‚Äôt get to stay next to them!!

-No Bidet at the toilet

- Lacking Tissue paper, the only one located in the toilet dispense in single pieces!

-Aircon could not be controlled somehow and it is NOT cool enough in hot weather

-Lame TV channels, web browser in TV could not work with Netflix or other streaming websites

-Hair Dryer is not located in the toilet and could not be removed

Conclusion:

I honestly like this hotel, modern looks, new furnitures and Amenities, great location, and a fairly good price if compared to hotels in Bugis or Lavender.

I would recommend this place for young couples on a budget as the location is good to explore.

Do not expect much if you‚Äôre traveling here with your family for a holiday as this hotel is somehow a travel agency favorite for having large group tours. It can get noisy and cramped, bound to have an unpleasant stay if you‚Äôre the fussy and intolerable sort. I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel for a long stay of more than a week.

I hope the hotel could extend the standard check out time and be more mindful of the guest comfort in regards to the toilet consumables. (TOILET ROLLS, TISSUE BOX AND BIDET PLEASE)

Everything smells like it was sprayed with an overwhelming amount of floral scented spray to the extent that one actually starts sneezing and gasp for air. The hotel is massive (1500 rooms) so guests are seen as just a number with NO personal attention or warm welcome from the staff. Reception staff couldn‚Äôt careless about ones experience or areas of concern. We booked 5 nights, non-refundable and checked out after spending only a few hours in the hotel.

The rooms are ridiculously small, dirty areas, walls have no point because one can hear everything happening in the hall, the smell of toilet-spray is hanging in the area, the kettle broken, no decor, no view and the bedding is completely worn-out.

The bathrooms have no toilet paper but a mere tissue dispenser which falls apart due to the cheapness of it. I‚Äôm not even sure one can call the small soap and tiny shampoo bathroom amenities. The towels are so old and used its hard as rock and the material is actually deteriorating.

The common areas smell either like smoke or holds a overwhelming floral (toilet-spray) smell. The buffet area looks like a production area, no elegance or class.

The location isn‚Äôt any better then the inside of the hotel. Barely anything to see in the surrounding area, so the MRT or taxi are really ones only option.

Rooms are small, but it's fine. Windows are very small, just a pillow width as seen from the picture I uploaded. The room allocated to me is right beside elevator. You could hear the elevator beeping sound as well people walking past. The frequency of people walking past is at maximum since it's closest to elevator. Could not sleep well. Guess it's just my luck. Otherwise, try to demand for room further away from elevator especially for locals. They give better treatment to foreigners, with more room upgrades given.

Date of stay: October 2017,GlobalTrek,Nightmare from Hell,"Without doubt this is one the most horrific hotel experiences of my lifetime, and I travel around 100 room nights per year. I was stuck in this utter hell hole for over two full weeks and I'm still recovering from the experience days later.

To be specific:

- The room I initially booked was TINY, as in zero space for any luggage whatsoever. The mattress nearly touches the three walls that surround it. The room did not look anything like the photos on the booking website. I had to threaten litigation with the tour operator in order to get ""upgraded"" to a room that had (barely) tolerable space.

- Rooms had zero soundproofing. I could hear other guests brushing their teeth, watching TV, talking, and even a few bodily noises. My room was directly next to the housekeeping station which resulted in mysterious crashing sounds of equipment for a solid hour each morning.

- The AC in my room would not cool below 24 degrees. The hotel does not have any fans to lend, so I went to a discount store and purchased a large electric fan to cool the room in the evenings. On the plus side, it drowned out a lot of the noise I was experiencing to that point.

- Aside from the lobby, the common areas were FILTHY, particularly the pool area (see photos). Rubbish and dirty towels strewn everywhere. I only saw staff cleaning the pool area one time whilst he was smoking a cigarette. Lovely!

- Whilst some of the staff did make an earnest effort to be friendly, training was poor. I routinely encountered staff in the lifts loudly smacking chewing gum, whistling, etc.

- The hotel has NO ICE available overnight. No machines. Nothing. Not even in the convenience store on the ground level. Guests must walk a considerable distance to 7-11 where only giant bags are available for purchase. I eventually worked out that the Chinese restaurant would sell smaller bags for $1-2 but that was late into my stay.

- At one point I lost my key. I went to the front desk and gave my room number and got a new one. No name or ID was requested. Not very reassuring from a security standpoint.

- Regular rolls of toilet paper are apparently too much of a luxury for Hotel Boss, so instead be ready to pull individual sheets of tissue from a dispenser located a few feet above and slightly behind the toilet.

- I returned to the room one evening to find a large swath of lipstick on my ostensibly clean sheets. Suffice it to say it wasn't mine.

- Room service isn't really room service. It's the menu of a nearby restaurant that will deliver to your room as per whatever agreement they have with the hotel.

- The hotel has 1,500 rooms making it among the largest in Singapore, yet the structure seems suitable for about half as many. Nearly every lift ride was completely packed stopping on multiple floors.

- The lobby is nice but is packed throughout the entire day with people who appear to be, well, just sitting there for no apparent reason. There is no queue management for the front desk - you just have to pick a person to stand behind and hope that their transaction doesn't take forever.

- Similarly, there is no enforcement by the bell staff of an organized taxi rank. Families would ignore the queue and simply pile into whatever taxi they wanted straight away.

Summarily, Hotel Boss is an unmitigated disaster. I will never set foot on this deplorable property again if I can possibly avoid doing so.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Dallas, Texas",89 ,136 ,,1.0

Room 516 was extremely small , facing a block of HDB flats . A small sense of cool chill rush past us . We thought it was the air con and leave it as it is . We open the roller blinds to let in the sunlight . A big mirror was design next to tv and facing part of the bed . It felt weird . I was staring at the mirror for a good few seconds . Trying to pacify myself although room was small but well , it is newer than V hotel lavender rooms . The toilet was tiny as well but it's new . The stuff provided was decent also.  My bf had to go out for a while to run some personal errands leaving me alone in the room for an hour or so . The moment he left , the mirror was fixated to my eyes again . I turn on YouTube , watch funny stuffs , and I saw a flash of light from the mirror to the door . I keep dismissing what I saw thinking I must be very tired the whole day from lack of sleep .  The internet was ok most times before midnight but , the same cold chill settled in the room again . Lowered the temperature abit , had abit of struggle with their led temperature remote panel . Then I had a quick shower and dried myself , snuggling back into the bed beneath the sheets . Everything was ok just a weird feeling that something is staring at me all the time . My bf came back after an hour plus . We drank some hard liquor and the bottle of liquor was left on the corner side table of the floor untouched . We snuggled in bed , suddenly , the bottle toppled over by itself (it was crazy) I was drifting in and out of tipsiness, was woke up by the toppling of the bottle . My bf heard a long breathing near the door by something (was very close to us) at 3am . Then we googled and realized there was a suicide at level 15th sometime back . So since it's the 7th month , don't encourage couples to go there and stay yah . Other than that , do recce for other hotels as the rooms in Hotel Boss is really tiny , not much of a nice city view anyway .",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",35 ,69 ,2.0,

Date of stay: July 2017,SleepingBeauty8000,Clean & Well Maintained Hotel near MRT at a decent price for 2 days,"The Hotel is situated at Lavendar MRT and is just a 5 minute walk when you exit the station.  I arrived in the evening and had no problem finding the hotel.  The walk was pleasant even with a luggage. The Room is a decent size one for a solo traveller but might be a bit cram for two if you have more than 1 luggage.  The Queen bed was clean and the sleep quality was good because the hotel provides Full Shade Roller Curtain.  While there is no wardrobe in the room, there are hanging hooks in the corridor and a small open-hanging cupboard above the desk (see photo) which is sufficient for my needs.  Hangers are available.  If you want to iron or do laundry, you can do it at the Recreation floor where the swimming pool and gym are located.  I saw coin laundry and ironing board there.  As for views, I have attached photos and you can see for yourself what's outside your window.The toilet is small but clean and the hotel provides basic tooth brush & paste, and towels.  I use my own set though.  Lighting is good as there are spot lights above the bed for reading a book.  Without the spot lights, Lighting is warm for TV viewing.  Wifi is available and speed was fine.The basic amenities are in the room except for a fridge. The desk is used for providing simple Tea drinks and one of the drawers is an electronic safe. But do you need a fridge since there is a 24-hour Food Court right at the Ground level of the hotel and also many Eateries and a supermarket at Lavendar MRT.  I liked walking over to the supermarket and juice stores there after dinner to get some drinks or fruits as the walk helped with digestion.  I agree with many hotel guests' observation that one can hear people talking in the corridor or if kids are running pass your room.  But fortunately I did not encounter much noise disturbance at night even though I did bring my ear plugs.  I did not hear the TVs in the adjacent rooms. The rooms are lined up in a circle around the building and have section glass doors.  I believe one can actually go out and close the section door to limit noise coming from other sections.  Alternatively, I believe the hotel management can also put signage in the corridor to alert house guests to be considerate about loud talking and running in the corridor given the sound proof situation.  Recreation wise, I went to their gym room on both evenings.    While the GYM is very small with just a few treadmills and cycling machines, the poolside GYM is very pleasant workout place as you can  watch people swimming in front of you even late in the evening.  There are also pool tables and chairs all over this recreation floor for guests to hang around for social drinks. Lastly, there is a 24-hour currency exchange near the hotel too.  My stay had been pleasant and I was quite happy that all the basic needs were met at the hotel and its vicinity. The Room price was also very decent for a one-year old hotel. and  I will come back again.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Hong Kong, China",132 ,80 ,,5.0

The main reason we were pleased was the location, really close to Lavender station and with the unlimited MRT pass we were able to cheaply see a lot of the sights in our 2 day stay. The reason why I've given this an average rating was that firstly, our room was tiny, not big enough for us to walk past each other let alone put our clothes or cases anywhere and with practically no natural light as we were facing into the lobby on quite a low floor. And secondly as the breakfast was very expensive.

Unfortunately there were a lot of tour/school groups visiting when I stayed this time and they were very noisy. They'd yell and run up and down the hallways, knocking on doors. The bed was hard in my room and it really wasn't a restful stay. Just as well I was out most of the days I stayed. The service was a bit lacklustre as well.
I don't think I'll return to this hotel again when I'm in Singapore next - I'll try a smaller, more boutique place near the MRT.

Date of stay: July 2017,SusanNSW,Good location ruined by paper thin walls,"On our arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a porter who insisted on taking our bags upstairs and was very friendly. I had already read on previous reviews that the rooms were small, therefore had booked a four person family room with balcony. The room was a reasonable size for three people, the balcony a good size. The room was provided with coffee making facilities and three mugs which still had stains on them from the previous occupants. We washed the mugs in the bathroom before using them and expected that maybe it was just a one off. The next day after the cleaner had finished making up the room, once again the mugs had stains on them. I contacted the front desk who arranged for someone to come and give us clean mugs. The next day after the cleaning was done we were once again provided with dirty mugs.

On our arrival we also noted that the toilet seat was loose. I reported this to the front desk however it took another two calls before anyone came to repair it and they expected us to stay in the room to wait for the maintenance person.

On the third day we ran out of toilet paper (should have been replenished the day before when it was getting low) however as we were going out, I expected that the room would be cleaned and paper replaced by our return in the afternoon. We arrived back at the hotel around 3pm to find that the room had not been cleaned yet. I went down to the front desk and advised them were were out of toilet paper and that the room had not been cleaned. I was curtly told they would send someone up shortly. We went out for about an hour and on our return nothing had been done. I went down to the front desk and spoke to the concierge. I told him our room had not been cleaned and we could not use the toilet due to lack of paper. He signalled to the staff member next to him and told her to call someone. About 15 minutes later the cleaner arrived; we had to wait on the balcony while he cleaned the room.

The worst part about this hotel was the paper thin walls. You could hear everything from next door and around the floor. On the second night a couple of families arrived in rooms across the corridor. Instead of using their phones in their rooms, they had a habit of coming into the corridor to conduct their conversation. We did not mind this too much until we were woken by their loud voices at 2am! So don't stay in this hotel if you value a good night's sleep.

All in all the location was good, close to two MRT stations and Bugis shopping precinct. There was a great food court downstairs and plenty of other eateries around the district.

Our stay was marred by noise from other occupants and the lack of attention to basic things such as hygiene and maintenance. As there are plenty of other hotels close to transport and shopping, I would definitely not stay here again. I am amused by Zakiah's responses to complaints on this forum that always promise to do better, however nothing seems to change.

Entrance
I rode my bicycle here, so was pushing it across the hotel lobby to the drive way where I can park my bicycle. Instead of helping me with the door, the door man chided me for pushing it across the lobby. Only when I told him I'm a staying guest, he kept quiet and stood still (without helping me with the door still).

Even if I'm not a guest, shouldn't he be approaching me with more courtesy instead of chiding me?

Reception
Check in was smooth and enjoyable. I think it was Ryan who checked me in, and he was really nice and efficient.

Housekeeping
Saw a housekeeper outside my room and asked her for extra pillows since I saw a few pillows on her cart. She couldn't speak English so I spoke to her in mandarin. She just brushed me off saying ""no extra, call downstairs"". But there was obviously pillows on her cart.

Call centre
Called call centre twice - first to ask for wifi password and the second for pillows. The first call was rudely answered and ended abruptly. However second one was pleasant and polite.

Room service
Room service menu is actually by a separate restaurant at the lobby. Called to order salad and a beer and requested for ice. But they refused to send up the ice and beer, just the food only. Which I really wondered why.

Room
Clean and new. Really comfortable beds. Sound proofing done really well because at the balcony, the traffic sounded really bad but once in the room, it was all quiet. Didn't even hear the morning worships from the mosque opposite and I was only on the fifth floor.

I would say the walls were unbearably thin though, in my opinion. I could hear people being loud next door and in the hallways at 2am in the morning and could even hear the bell of the elevators.

2 bottles of water per day complimentary. Instant coffee powder and tea bags in room. Not meeting your expectations? Can always buy from shops close by.

Not many English channels on the TV. The wall is thin, so quietness will depend a lot on other hotel guests. During my stay, they are mainly Chinese and Indians.

Most of the space was taken up by the bed and once we shoved the luggage under the shelf where the tea/coffee maker etc are kept, there was barely enough space to walk. The rooms have no shelf or wardrobe. Only four hangers (one of them was broken) were provided. The tea maker was dirty & faulty and on requesting the customer service, we were told, quite rudely, that there would be no replacement. The rooms are not sound proof & it is quite natural to hear conversations & noise floating from outside.

It's in a great location near Kampong Glam and its funky cafes and restaurants, not far from Bugis MRT station.

We were a family of three travelling with another family of three, and we were thrilled to find two triple rooms @ S$198 at short notice. We were flying back to Australia late the next night and staff accommodated our request for a late checkout with no hassle at all. We had two rooms til 1pm and paid S$20 per hour after that to keep one room til 6pm. With three tired kids between us, it was money well spent.

The room was very small (tiny bathroom) but everything we needed was there and it was all new and worked well. No wardrobe though, just a small hanging rail above the desk.

Date of stay: July 2017,Apanda8,It's clean but that is it,"This hotel was set up by our tour company that I had booked the end of last year. The reviews that I read were decent and the rooms looked nice.

Over the last few months reviews were mixed on other sites like TripAdvisor, google, Yelp, etc.

We arrived from the airport to hotel boss. We checked in with ease even though the lobby was overflowing with children.

We arrived to our room to discover the smallest room in our travels. We have even stayed at a prison (that was redone into a hotel) in Europe. It was quite a shock for us. We both have two large suitcases and two small ones which clearly barely fit in the room. Our bed was small and we had to be strategic when we walk in the room so we didn't bump into each other. Our balcony was bigger than our room!!!

Luckily another local Yelper (shoutout to Nik) took
Us around the city so we didn't spend much of the day in the room.

That night when we slept in the room it had paper thin walls so we heard all the outside noise in the hallway at all hours of the night.

My husband and I tried to go to the gym at 615 and the gym was pitch dark. It didn't open until 7am. We decided to wait for breakfast and it was not very good and didn't offer that much variety.

We decided to leave after one night and cash in on our Marriott points for an upgrade. Please note we don't need a nice hotel.

Date of stay: July 2017,InfoMiss Trips,"Hostel posing as a hotel, nice staff, odd amenities, ill-mannered guests","I usually try to only comment on my positive experiences. Had I entered Hotel Boss with the expectation of a hostel-like stay, I might have given it an extra star, but the place literal has the word ""Hotel"" in its name. Our booking was for 3 nights in 2 superior double rooms. Hotel Boss does not have connecting rooms. The staff at the Hotel Boss was always kind and did their best to be helpful.

The bad: First, the lobby is under 24/7, unrelenting, cloying deodorizing. The air ""freshener"" is so strong my throat was swelling. After a 30-minute meeting at the lobby cafe, I had a gnarly headache, which went away after I got out of the lobby. It's overwhelmingly bad and a thoroughly obnoxious smell.

Room Service is ordered through the downstairs unaffiliated restaurant - Papasan. All meals are sent up in plastic. Ice is sent up in a plastic box and contains 3-12oz cups of ice - and they want $5 for it. Walk down and get your ice from the Thai tea place (""Saint"") near the FoodClique. I took the plastic container I received from Papasan and was only charged 1.50. Still not cheap, but better than $5.

Breakfast in the morning is not good. If you are paying extra for breakfast, I would skip it and go to FoodClique or Lavender Station if you must stay at Hotel Boss. Breakfast at Papasan is an array of tasteless calories. The coffee was good. I took my cup to go as one would do in a hotel and was berated the following morning when I returned it. Really? Chewed out by a restaurant employee because of the hotel & restaurants weird arrangement that is unlike most hotels in the world? I worked in Food & Beverage for many years and you do NOT discipline your customers. Tacky and inappropriate.

The rooms are crazy small. If someone is sitting at the desk, you will have a tight squeeze to get to the fridge, or it's a climb over the bed. The room entrance door will slam into the bathroom door if you haven't closed it thoroughly. The Boss Hotel rooms are smaller than a room at the Marriott and I did not think that could be possible.

Ill-mannered Guests: 2 out 3 nights we were at Hotel Boss, we needed to report smokers on our floor, despite the fact that this is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel. The hotel staff did come round and knock the doors to find out who was smoking, which we really appreciated. My kids asked me take a shower before sleeping with them because I smelled too much of smoke. I don't care if people smoke, but when it affects/harms me, I very much care.

On the subject of ill-mannered guests, there was a lady balling/whaling in the hallways that seemed like she was having a lovers quarrel or such. The whaling was off and on for a couple of hours on night one. Morning of Day 2, we endured the noisy departure of a group of tourists at 7-8am that had zero interest in the fact that the rest of the floor wasn't going on their tour. Back and forth between rooms, talking at full volume in all of their chaos for an hour while all we wanted to do was sleep a bit longer.

The lobby at the Hotel Boss is like a train station with an air freshener stench. Except at 6:00am, I never once saw less than 50+ people hanging out in the Lobby. The Hotel Boss seems to attract tour groups, so be aware.

There is no ability to communicate with staff about rooms (no door knob signs?) - either to clean or Not Disturb. One night my spouse was woken up in the middle of the night by a baggage person knocking on the wrong room. The next day he was again woken up from a deep sleep when he was feeling ill and trying to rest. Our rooms were cleaned 2 out of the 3 days. We don't really need much cleaning, but would love the trash dumped. A door sign would've fixed all of this.

The Internet wasn't perfect. Wifi download speed was 10Mbps, upload was 2Mbps, but it was spotty. It worked but was sometimes difficult with multiple users.

The shower water would sometimes not get hot/warm, so we took a few cold showers.

We used Hotel Boss only as a crash pad and tried to stay away all day, so we couldn't take advantage of the nice pool. We were all glad to leave at the end of 3 days.

The Good:
The pool was nice. It was a nice length, it was warm and there were towels. Chlorine levels felt normal. Nice view from the pool area with nice cabanas.

It's close to a SMRT station - Lavender.

There is a fresh-squeezed OJ vending machine on level 4. It costs $2 for about 4 oz of juice, and is nice to have avail.

There is a water fountain on level 4 to refill your water containers/bottles.

There are no in-room irons. There is a community laundry area with ironing boards and irons. This is actually pretty cool and makes good sense, but its just more evidence that when you stay at the ""Hotel"" Boss you're staying at an pricey hostel.

Food Clinque had hawker foods that were nice. The Thai tea shop next door (""Saint"") was a treat. The little shops outside of the lobby where the taxis drop off are sweet and much better than the Cheers shop near Food Clinque.

Again, staff at Hotel Boss was nice.

The room was very clean everything seemed very new. There is a dryer in the room and toiletries in the bathroom. What we thought it was funny first night when we came in the room there was a note on the bed saying that they did not made the bed because we had personal things on it (pajamas)....so next day we remove our pajamas from the bed. There is also a safe in the room. They have a laundry which is OUTDOOR?! u have to pay $5SGD for laundry but u can iron for no charge.

We booked the superior or deluxe (cannot remember exactly) double room and paid 188 SGD per night but the hotel is not worth the money at all. I know that Singapore is expensive but there are just too many negative points:

The room is clean, but very small (no place for luggage)

The room service is irregular and doesn't bother forgetting to clean your room even after making a call

Extremely noisy, you can hear everything that is going on on the floor and in other rooms. Not the hotel's fault but people have extremely loud conversations on the floor and ""accidentally"" knock on our door in the middle of the night.

Bad customer service: Staff who are rude and rudely ask ""card number?!?"" Before you can even ask a question, The phone service just hangs up the phone while talking

The breakfast is terrible. Small choice, low quality. You can walk just 2mins to Lavender station and eat there much better and for less than 5Dollars.

Besides that, very very slow and bad wifi and only 1 beach towel per day per person (no towels to clean your hands or face etc.)

The cleanliness and amenities are typical for a 3-star hotel but can't beat the location.

The rooms were clean and had everything that I needed for my stopover.  The bed was very comfortable and the view from my window was extremely pleasant.

Date of stay: June 2017,Samantha De Castro,Not worth your money,"This hotel is pricey yet they manage to fail each of my expectations.
First, wifi sucks, it's slow as hell. There's a time were our cable had been interrupted for an hour so internet for our room were interrupted as well.
Second, they don't get the old towels so in our 4 days stay, we had 16 towels in the room.
Third, no free breakfast for the rate considering it's 500 dollars a night for a VERY SMALL ROOM. Yes, it is small. It doesn't feel like the room is for 4 when I indicated that it should be for 4.
Fourth, there are no cabinet. My luggage is beside the bed, so it consumes the space in my tiny room.
Fifth, pillows are soooooo thin, it is not enough and not comfortable. One pillow per person.
Sixth, I booked for 4, the bottled water given to us each day is only for 3.
Seventh, the toilet is small as well, as small as the airplane's.

So please book in another hotel and get your money's worth. There are other hotels that offer the same price for better quality. The only nice thing in the hotel is that it is in front of the bus stop but it is 1 km away from Bugis and Mustafa.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Makati, Philippines",179 ,46 ,1.0,

It cost 12 SGD each and it definitely was not worth it but good if you just want to fill the tummy. The selection was horrible with toast being the highlight for me. There was butter but no other spreads available. Other selections were scrambled eggs, baked beans, ""fresh fruit"" (watermelon and cantelope), potatoes, spring rolls, oats (do not even bother) noodles and a few others.

assisted by Customer officer called Mr.Adam Koh, who did a superb service. He was really clear on the instructions, and was really helpful. Understanding our
situation he even provided us facility for a late checkout free of charge. That made sure our 1st impression was good.

Hotel was superb for those who wish to travel all around the Singapore, and want a place to take a good nap, stay comfortably, relax (pool/gym), and head back

to city. Another great thing is there are many eating spots all around the place (In the hotel and outside) which are having lowest to higher price range. Also burger
king and McDonals is also pretty close.

Date of stay: May 2017,–¢–∞—Ç—å—è–Ω–∞ –°,Value for money,"Not for a long stay as the rooms are very small.  If you book a room without a balcony you will not have even breath of fresh air as the windows are blocked and the room is 14 sq m including the bath room space.  If you have a balcony (it is upper category of the room)  at least you can open it in the evening when it is not too hot. The bed is comfortable. No wardrobe and no space for a bag. Rather low ceiling. Noisy from the floor,  you can hear people talking when passing by to the elevator.  And if your room is close to the elevator you hear the bell every time the elevator arrives. So the best choice is to book the room with the city view and with the balcony and send a comments to the hotel you want a room away from the elevator. Location is good.  To the main attraction you can get by public transportation, mrt station Lavender is 3 min walk from the hotel,  the but stop is just across like 20 min and it is even more comfortable to get everywhere by bus. And always taxi is available downstairs near the taxi sign. The food court with very local food is just the next door from the main entrance. Wonderful open swimming pool and the chill out area on the 4th level. The gym is small.  Only 2-3 people can make their workout at the same time. Always free drinking water and clean towers  are available near the gym.  The swimming pool is open and lighten even later then announced like until 12 PM. Very nice big lobby. The hotel is new and clean. The Mustafa market is in 5 minutes walking distance and open 24/7.

Third, not sure what system this is. The ac can only be set to a minimum of 21 temp and the compressor goes off. You wake up in the middle of the night sweating.

She knew I was approaching for she gave me a top to toe running glance over before she decided to 'look' busy. A male Chinese staff noticed my plight and asked me to go over to his station. Check in was a long draggy process despite my booking in advance. By the way there is no housekeeping provided within the same day of booking. Budget travelers might be happy with this setup. The cost matches the service. But this is a new and clean looking hotel.,Trip type: Travelled on business,"Singapore, Singapore",35 ,39 ,3.0,

Date of stay: May 2017,66agupta,Should be renamed as Hotel Mess,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 21st to 23rd of May. This hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed

At the time of check I requested for 2 rooms next to each other as one room was for children but person at the reception told us that 2 room available are far to each other and 2 different lifts are used for each of these rooms and even after repeated request he did not listen to us. He gave us room no 1926 and 1928. But when we checked in the rooms they were next to each other. This show how inexperience and Unknowledgeable the staff is.

Secondly, After getting card for our rooms I requested the person at concierge (name-Firdaus) to sent the luggage to our rooms but he told me that he is very busy and we should carry the luggage ourselves and he was doing just nothing.
We requested another employee and he immediately took luggage to our room.

Thirdly, in the room kettle was dirty as previous guest may have cooked some noodles in it

Fourth, rooms as so small in size that we could not find space to keep all our luggage. No cabinet in the rooms
Moreover lobby is very crowded as many big groups stays there. Maybe as they have tie up with some of the travel agents.

So this hotel is not Boss but a total Mess

The room is so small, I can barely move my 6ft body around the room.

The shower is almost impossible for me to shower in without knocking the water off. Totally bad.

But the clincher was there is no ironing board in the room and there are TWO IRONS only in a common outside area, for 1500 rooms. And they claim this is a 3.5 star hotel, no way. I had to wait 20 minutes to iron a business shirt. Come on, what's this!

There is also a MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE in the event of a fire. There is no way the fire escapes are large enough to evacuate the lower floors in conjunction with the upper floors. I noted that many rooms have 2 people and many children, so being able to evacuate say 6000 people out in the narrow stairs, I simply cannot see occurring.

So I told him that I am going to the money changers. But he told me that it wasn't needed. His commitment was enough. The next day when I went there to give money the manager told me I needed to pay 1000 sgd. When I Sayeed him about the receptionist he told me that doesn't matter. Only money mattered.

Restaurent with breakfast package not worth it. I had breakfast included which is 16 $S per person. Hotel rooms are cozy and clean but very narrow space. Rooms are made of wood or board I don't know. But it's not sound proof. You can hear all the walking sound and talking in the corridors or near rooms. Specially when the floor is fully packed with South Indian people and there loud voice.

Rooms are very small and there is nowhere to put your clothes apart from a tiny hanging rail, We coped as we were out most of the time but if you are a person who likes to chill in your room this isn't for you. The hotel is a nice central location which is good. One last thing the service on reception was shocking, we asked on our last night if we could book a taxi as we had an early flight and it was Chinese New Year and the gentleman said no you be able to get a taxi no problem in the morning out front, well you know what happened, no taxis couldn't get one anywhere time was ticking and reception said they couldn't get one as they are busy due to Chinese New  Year holiday (really!!) and they virtually wash their hands of us.Eventually after about half hour walking up and down the street I managed to get one myself and I was lucky as the taxi driver was about to go home but took sympathy on us, this is no way to treat guests but never mind you live and learn and next time I know not to stay there, If you are thinking about going Singapore go I loved it but maybe stay elsewhere.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",56 ,48 ,2.0,

Date of stay: May 2017,Jay T,Big value in a small space ,"Kind of lengthy review here but wanted to cover most of every I can think of while I'm at work and it is fresh on the brain.I stayed May 10-16, 2017. I was a little bit nervous after reading some reviews online before arriving there.  I am from the USA so I'm used to space and general western standards.  First I arrived at the hotel itself after midnight and was immediately surprised at how clean and spacious the lobby was.  It was also really easy to get to from the airport as it sits right on the corner of jalan sultan and Victoria streets.  This means that it also has the bus stop right on the corner which is a huge plus if you want to try the public transportation system.  Large area for vans, ubers and cabs to pull into their circle drive for pickup and drop off.  I was initially given a room on the 11th floor with balcony that overlooked terrace and I asked to switch to a city view style room and was granted that on the 14th floor.  For anyone that complains about the size of the room and how small it is the first thing you should have noticed is that they don't have a single room with king size bed available. What is it that you expect knowing that fact alone? Also if you are a big person either heavier in weight or taller in size then you won't be comfortable without a much larger family room or something with multiple beds. To be honest it is likely most comfortable for a common size and height person.  Overall though since I travel pretty light the room for me was actually really manageable.  I counted 3 total power plug ins with non of then actually being in the bathroom. The lighting is good but has some decently dark spots as it is mostly small led pods above the bed and desk area.  They have a full length mirror but because of the lighting I'm not sure exactly how much use it is if you need it to see a bunch of dress details.  None of the multicolored linen was present like it is in the pictures but that's not a big deal to me personally.  The white linen was clean and changed everyday along with my two bottles of water.  The staff spoke great English and was actually really friendly.  I'll include the sales guy down for the tourist activities as well since he helped and drove also for the safari tour.  For a fee of course. Ha.  The room came equipped with hot water, and tea maker deal TV with its on WiFi system, desk with a chair, mini fridge and of course a balcony which really was half the size of the room in general.  I kind of would gave preferred to have half of that outside space inside and a little smaller patio but it does offer a great alternative to close quarters if you're in your room late and can't sleep or want a morning tea.  The shower itself was good, the water was soft and it had a removable shower head that allows for better reach.  Small counter space for personal item storage also.  I could actually control the ac in my room contrary to what I had read.  The TV had a movie channel and BBC news as pretty much the only English speaking channels but it did have YouTube and once you disable the filter in the settings you get better content access. The Internet is setup by room and is actually pretty quick.  I had my firestick and zero issues with it whatsoever.  The power outlets are exactly like the ones used in Australia but they do have 2 USB ports as well to charge.  The bed was pretty firm and the pillows were kind of flimsy but nothing you couldn't fold and make decent.  There was not very much activity happening on my floor hallways but I can say that the walls are thin in either case. My window in the room overlooked the river also.  Again the kicker of the room itself is the patio which is nearly a wrap around.  Big bonus there.  The gym isn't really much of a gym but is manageable if you want to sacrifice some normal amenities.  It consists of 3 treadmills a couple of bikes and a small universal.  It is located just in front of the pool.  The pool itself is a nice size and spacious enough for those guests that want to swim for fun or take in laps for exercise.  The view also is really nice.  The pool area is usually left pretty dirty at the end of the day by the tourists from India (just what I noticed) but the staff there always have it back right before 6am.  I only know this because I was at the gym each day at that time.  Sidenote since you are close to little India also should expect A LOT of Indian guests and their traditional habits.  One of those is women swimming with most all of their clothing on.  I get it and I respect it so once I realized what it was I just overlooked it and kept doing my thing.  Some might find that odd.  Now to location and environment. Hotel boss is directly across the street from a mosque which as I caught it got pretty active at about 530am each day with songs prayers etc.  10 minute walk or so to little India, 5 minute walk (east /west) one direction across the bridge to get to the mrt, McDonald's, burger king and another great food court.  If you walk opposite that on Victoria then you would be a 7/8 minute walk to bugis junction Mall which is great for shopping, movie and of course more food.  The food courts in that area are actually pretty cheap.  Walking along jalan sultan (North South) towards concourse(building with Starbucks inside) you will find 711 and that sultan Nightclub as well as some other stores along the way including a cool breakfast place. There are spas and solid places to hang out near this beach street and jalan sultan intersection and it Segway  into little India.  In the opposite direction you get more into the local environment of Singapore with more authentic food shops and local shopping places.  There is a Tappan place down stores along with a bistro, 2 general stores(1 is 24 hours) a small food court and a souvenir shop.  I did not use the car park so can't attest to that.  Outside of the 4th floor is also the washer dryer area.  Cost is 5 dollars for each. So ten sing dollars to wash and dry.  I didn't pay that just cause I feel it is too high.  There are only two irons on property.  They are located right in front of the laundry stuff. Overall I would stay here again for sure.  The price was fair for what you get and the location is actually a big plus considering how easy it is to get to and from it by public transportation, private car or just walking at any time of the day.  Lots of accessible food as well.  It's small but fair.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,,11 ,2 ,,4.0

The view from the pool/gym was nice, but very disconcerting that other guests were filming us whist using these amenities. Had to ask them to stop. Not the hotels fault, but still weird.

Neat and Cleanliness
New Property at great location
Lots of ameneties like pool, laundry, luggage storage
LED TV with apps
Centally located
Very large hotel with more than 1500 rooms
Prompt customer service
Taxi availability

What we did not liked
Rooms are very very small. Hardly 2 people can stay in the room and there is no space to move freely around. We had taken 2 rooms due to this.
Bath room is tiny one and if you are a medium/thin built then only you can fit in the shower cubicle
Breakfast options are very less for vegitarians. You need to survive on bread, cereal and fruits. This may not be an issue with non-veg folks
Though walkable distance from little india, you need to walk atleast 750m. However most of restraurants deliver food to hotel.
Asked for hot milk to make coffee, they told me upfront that they cant provide. Not sure how one can make coffee with milk if the milk is cold or at room temperature
Does not offer great views from room

Date of stay: March 2017,Yurieca Garnis,Location is everything,"I went for two nights trip to Singapore and decided to book this hotel along with my friend. Here's the pluses and minuses of Hotel Boss Singapore.

+ Pluses
1. Easy Check-in, despite the queue.
We booked hotel online, showed our booking print and passport, we got the keys.
As easy as that.

2. Average room size in clean condition
We were placed at the 7th floor, glad to see quiet space between bathroom and the bed. Love the huge window, it gave the light every morning we woke up. Also we had a balcony to chill, with the city view. It's pretty nice. The bathroom was okay, only the trash bin was outside, so we moved it inside the bathroom.

3. The APPSTV, it's literally a fun thing in the room.
We spent time watching Youtube at night through the TV! A nice experience, because it's pretty cool. But too bad at the second day, the TV didn't work as the first day.

4. Lavender MRT is only 3 minutes away!
This is the highlight of my stay in Hotel Boss. The MRT is sooooo close with the hotel, I had no problem commuting around midnight. Plus the area was so close with every other places like Bugis Junction, Arab Street, and such. There's a mosque at the right side of the hotel, nice for Moslem travelers.

5. Very close with food complex
If you wanted to have a breakfast like the local, you can just go to Kitchener Complex, the same direction with the Lavender MRT. You can have all kinds of food there. I enjoyed my toast along with Milo Dinosaur every morning from Toastbox.

6. Nice staff
Staffs are nice and polite and until check out, we didn't experience anything bad.

- Minuses
1. Room design is too plain
I believe Hotel Boss can do better with the space and room usage.

2. The bed was not too soft, but okay.

3. It's hotel for short trip, not for a staycation or family stay. Maximum 3 person in a room at the same time.

4. Wifi sometimes stop working with no sign, it appeared connected while it's not.
If you go for a business trip, it could be a little bothersome; although when connected it's pretty fast.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Hotel Boss and happy to recommend it to others.

Cons:

-You can control the AC temperature but not the fan level, so the fan switches on & off all night. I am a light sleeper, so this disturbed my rest.
-Poor sound insulation between rooms: the first 2 nights were fine but the 3rd day we could clearly hear our neighbors, even though they were talking at a normal level. This is the fault of the hotel construction, not our neighbors. You'll just have to hope you get lucky and not have people in the next door rooms.
-We checked in as a group & they had accidentally canceled 5 of our rooms, instead of the 1 cancelled room we requested.

The location of the hotel was very good for easy access to ALL THE PLACES OF SIGHTSEEING INTEREST. One more reason for our choosing this hotel is the proximity ( ~ 800 Metres) to The Mustafa Centre, vegetarian restaurants and Indian Shops in and around that place in the Little India region, and the Balaji Temple.

Nice and Neat Hotel. The location of the Hotel is great, just walking distance from Bugis junction and Little India. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel. Staff are ok. Bath Towels are replaced daily you don't have to request for it. They have complimentary bottles of water and coffee daily. If you get the room with balcony you will enjoy the balcony üòä
They have blower inside the drawer.
If you dont have plans yet for your tour, they have an agency in the corner of the lobby where you can buy tickets for ride, places to visit.
The internet connection is very good both in room and lobby. You can also use their tv to use for internet / google on something.

Negative side:
The room is quite small, they dont have coffee table inside the room for there is no more space for that. No cabinets, but there is a corner where you can hang your clothes. If your travelling with many luggages it would be a problem because there is little space in the room.

They only provide 1 trashcan. So either you can place it inside the bathroom or your bedroom. The Toilet bowl has no sprinkler/bidet spray.

They have the same kind of breakfast everyday if you plan to avail their buffet breakfast. Though they have two restos : 1st floor - western food; 4th floor - asian food - Their buffet breakfast costs $12 in SG each.

Bring the ff:
*SOAP - because they only give you one time very small soap;
*Slippers - they dont provide one.

The view of Singapore flyer and Super treetops of Gardens by the bay from room window was really nice. overall the room was small, but  could manage. The room service was good. They offer international breakfast buffet from 6.30am to 10am which was really convenient for travellers. There is a food court and ""cheers"" convenience store in ground floor, so that you can have those emergency goods and other meals from there.

Date of stay: March 2017,aliskyyyy,Loved it.,"We had a fantastic weekend at Hotel Boss! Reading the reviews I already knew what to expect but it definitely exceeded our expectations. It's a very short walk from Lavender station and a slightly longer walk to Bugis centre where there is lots of food and shopping. I found the rooms very comfortable and tidy, with everything you need. We asked for an early check in and a room with a view and Vincento (Vincent? Vincente?) went out of his way to ensure we got a fantastic room- and the view was spectacular! The staff were very nice and very professional. We didn't eat at the hotel as we are more 'street-food' kind of people, but the food court downstairs did not disappoint! The pool area is great also. Overall it is very basic but done well- Singapore is very expensive and to have higher quality of everything would mean 200+ a night at least, but we were extremely happy. Thanks Hotel Boss for making our Singapore experience great!

Only downside- the corridoors carry sound so I was woken up on our last morning by someone yelling loudly- but I can be pretty loud myself and happy to put people in their place. They stopped yelling and all was well afterwards!",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Perth, Australia",5 ,6 ,4.0,

Date of stay: March 2017,skyperceus,Being Generous with 1 Star,"For a hotel which is supposedly relatively new and smoke free, the first room I was checked into stunk of cigarette smoke. Requested for a change, which was promptly given but the toilet stunk of pee. Decided to fork out extra cash to upgrade to the Premier Balcony, which had a musky smell as well, but whatever, it was too much of a hassle to change again.

Upside was the view I had from the balcony. However, with the amount charged for the Premier Balcony, there are much better hotels in the vicinity.

Also experienced absolutely poor handling of guests affairs and communication amongst staff. During check in, I had clearly indicated I would be checking out late and would be willing to bear any additional charges. I even went down to the front-desk the day before my check out to remind them that I would be checking out only at 6pm and would like to NOT be interrupted as I would be sleeping in. However to my absolutely horror, I received 4 phone calls and 2 knocks on my door by 6 different staff (!) from 11am to 5pm on the day of my check out.

On checkout, when I queried why so many staff needed to interrupt my stay, all I was told with a shrug of the shoulders was that they needed to ensure they collect the charges incurred for the late check out. Seriously!!??",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Singapore, Singapore",8 ,7 ,1.0,

Their ""superior room"" is the smallest box room I have ever stayed in - it doesn't even have a wardrobe! Worse still when we checked into our room the bathroom was filthy. There were urine stains and hairs on the toilet seat and hairs in the sink. We called reception twice asking for it be cleaned but no one bothered until the next day! Our sleep was also disturbed 2 out of 3 nights with loud, drunk hotel guests shouting in the halls on Night 1 and with loud banging by hotel staff on Night 2.

On turning back the bed cover we discovered a soiled pillow case which was reported to management at reception - we were subsequently offered a room upgrade which we accepted. The new room was slightly larger than the original room but had no other additional features. We had prebooked breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was dreadful The food was all cold even when it was brought straight from the kitchen. On complaining to management we were informed that the restaurant is contracted out to another company and the hotel staff can do nothing about it. We were then upgraded to the halal restaurant which was no better. Other guests to whom we spoke were equally disappointed by the hotel; one Australian lawyer said 'this hotel is crap' and we agreed.

Exceeding expectations:
1. Massive lobby - plenty of room to hold a great the crowd who, like you, are looking the best value for money

2. Efficient check-in and check-out - since booking was placed via Agoda, processing time to get room keys took 10 mins (for passport info) and to check-out, 10 seconds (surrender room keys and go).

3. Queen plus single bed - orthopedic beds were comfortable with clean sheets, one pillow each head and enough space for 3 ladies.

4. Taxis at the lobby - plenty available throughout the day

Be prepared for:
1. Luggage space. Our 2 hand-carries and one medium luggage fit just right. A larger luggage will occupy the space between the two beds

2. Shower pressure. Not strong but has good drain. Shampoo, bar of soap, body wash, good clean towels are provided.

3. Toilet paper. 2-sheet pull ups are of tolerable softness. Do be wary since the convenience store on the hotel block only sells wet ones.

4. No closet. There is an open shelf with hangers near TV (for shirt-length items) and 3 additional hooks provided on the hallway wall.

5. Bring your own slippers.

Date of stay: March 2017,Ben T,Average - Standard of service could be better,"My first impression was etched when the overwhelming air freshener smell engulfs my nose upon entrance to the hotel. The front-desk person could be much friendlier during my check-in as her face was totally blank with no expression whatsoever. She keyed in an amount on her calculator and she mentioned that that was the final amount I'm supposed to pay. I gave her my credit card and she charged it a dollar higher. I asked her if the higher price is the correct price and she just nodded yes with no apology or clarification. I wasn't very particular about it because it's just a difference of a dollar but other guests may not be as forgiving for not ensuring accuracy in pricing.

Room was average (booked the premier room with balcony). I was expecting the room to be a little bit more equipped like a welcome information book (apparently the info was all in the TV but it was not clear enough - had to find out breakfast timings online); bathroom lacked any hand towels or hand soap, etc. Basically the room was equipped with the most basic stuff, that's all. I'd say the redeeming factor was the cable TV.

Breakfast was a little underwhelming due to the quality. The front-desk lady forgot to include breakfast during my check-in (I didn't know) and I had to argue a little with the restaurant greeter in the morning before heading over to front-desk to rectify the issue. Again, the same front-desk lady gave a poker face while she reinstated the breakfast and mumbled to me that she included it in already, without any apology.

There are redeeming factors such as the strategic location, nice swimming pool, cable TV, helpfulness of the operator as my cable TV shut off halfway and they immediately got someone to come up to my room to rectify the fault.

I was attended to by another lady (I think her name was Shirley) for my check-out and she was extremely pleasant and the transaction was smooth.

I feel that the standard of service could be more consistent as it creates very lasting impressions. It was an overall average stay and I would heavily consider other options if I had another staycation opportunity in the future.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",34 ,9 ,3.0,

If you are a Halal eater, then you eat on the 4th floor and everybody else eats on the first floor and the hotel does it's best to provide for everone, which is good, however they provide chicken ham and chicken sausages, which to a westerner are quite disgusting.
The choices of cereals are basically limited to cornflakes and coloured sugar puff type things, which seemed stale every time I tried them.There is a choice of brown or white bread , which most people chose to toast and scrambled eggs and beans, which was good. There was also rice, noodles, porridge and cucumber, tomatoes and two types of fresh melon, plus an assortment of other things to cater for mainly asian guests.
We were lucky to have a great room with a view.There are 19 floors, with very quick lifts. The rooms were cleaned and fresh bedding, towels and toiletries every day.There is a choice of shops and eateries under the hotel and the pool area is very good.
If you use the laundry, prepare for a long wait as it is tiny and always busy!

we can hear people noise from the corridor clearly and the smell of food from hotel's kitchen or restaurant from outside even the window was a fixed closed window.

Siti called a colleague over for assistance, but this colleague also looked quizically at the screen.  I finally called over an older gentleman who appeared to be more senior to resolve the situation.  He did so promptly and efficiently because it turned out to be a simple matter; however, he attempted to defend the receptionist by saying she was new.  I had to explain:  *  Having new staff is fine, but they need to be appropriately trained--this means the new staff member should be able to read the message on his/her computer screen;  *  If the new staff member requires assistance, she should request it rather than staring at the screen and wasting time;  *  The (presumably more experienced) colleague should be able to assist instead of also staring at the computer and wasting time; and  *  When I say my husband is already in the hotel and I have just arrived, the staff member should not ask nonsensical questions in light of this information.Other staff on other days were fine.Apart from this, the rooms were small and the insulation and ventilation were concerning--we heard and smelled our neighbor passing wind several times on the second night.

Date of stay: March 2017,NickinNagoya,Misses the mark,"Checked in late after our flight was delayed, so arriving around midnight. Asked to pre-pay room at check-in. The room itself was smaller than I had expected based on the Lobby photos. I am used to smaller rooms in Tokyo, and this was a bit bigger than those ones so no real issue. No handtowels provided, only bath towels. Missing a night stand which is shown on the rooms advertised online. When I called to Reception, was told there is none. There was a ledge near the window where I could place my glasses and alarm clock. So the room was not quite up to my expectations.
Paid SGD$21 extra for a room with breakfast. The breakfast was well below par from my point. The buttons of the coffee machine that usually dispenses cappuccinos were covered with cardboard, so only option is black coffee. Fine. When I asked if there as juice available, I was told that it was the punch. I asked again for juice and was told there was no juice. I noticed a line at the fruit/salad bar which had 6 bowls. There were two bowls of watermelon and 2 bowls of melon but only one serving tong available. I asked the staff if it was possible to get another serving spoon and was told no and to wait in line. Generally speaking, it seemed like quality was mediocre on all the ingredients, so the breakfast was lackluster and definitely would bring my overall star rating to poor., certainly below average.
I was planning to stay here next week, but just finished book elsewhere. Going to try out the pool before the 11am check out.
The room is clean and no smell of smoke. Noise from hall is not too noticeable if people are considerate. Shower was fine.

Date of stay: March 2017,doraemonger,A day as a tourist - 4th March,"Decided to stay here for staycation to explore Arab street and Jalan Besar. Good location but stay one time will do..

Lobby was heavily perfumed with air freshener, overwhelmed for me as I have very sensitive nose.

Check in reception either occupied or doing own stuffs even when we were standing in front of the counters for about 5 mins, not knowing which counter to go to. Check in with Shannen, bad attitude, asked for our identity cards and after registered, left our IC on the counter without informing that she's done with it. No eyes contact, no smile.

Stayed at 07-57 with balcony. View was more to the nearby HDB flats/ factories. Not really worth paying extra for a city view. Room was really small and came with flat pillows. No wardrobe but toiletries are included. Floor was very slippery and sticky, like over poured floor cleaner and left it without cleaning with clean clear water. My little gal slipped and hit her head quite a few times.. Bed was quite firm and had creaking sound. Sound proofing was poor to the max..

Pool's water was cold, through out the day and night. Chlorine smell was quite strong too. Not very suitable for kids or people with sensitive skin to swim in.. No lifeguard and no restrictions of pool use timing though stated closed at 9pm. Had a group of people hanging at pool area till 3am and can hear their laughter and talking loud and clear in our room with the balcony door closed. Playground is only half shelter and it was on the small scale side.

Breakfast.. I rather head to the foodcourt.. Don't even understand why we paid extra for breakfast. So simple fares that doesn't needs culinary skills at all. Scramble eggs were tasteless, watery and perhaps add too much water to it thus the super pale colour. Porridge don't even have other side dishes to go along with, perhaps peanuts or preserved cabbage. Salad choices were pathetic. Think the only edible food was bread. Oh ya, check the plates and mugs carefully before use. Staff who was manning the entrance was quite rude so were the cleaners.

Overall, it's a bad stay for us. Didn't sleep well, didn't have a good breakfast and have to check out by 11am. Definitely not a choice for staycation.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",414 ,85 ,,1.0

Beautiful lobby, lots of staff, room is miniscule, just enough room to walk around the queen size bed with a bedside table on only one side, bed is rock hard which seems the norm for SE Asia, but I awoke with a sore shoulder. Bathroom is also cramped but functional.

Upon check-in we were told booking including breakfast but upon going down to the lobby restaurant there was no breakfast, we had to have a bit of back and forth with the front desk before they gave us breakfast included for our short stay, would rather of not had to argue with them, they're excuse being the clerk who booked us in was new and made a mistake, in which case just do the right thing immediately and look after your guest without making an incident of it.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Oakville, Canada",53 ,8 ,4.0,

I actually working in SG thus I'm quite familiar with the location and direction. Chose this hotel due to the price is quite reasonable with this location. It's just around 7 mins walking distance from Lavender station and it's near to Bugis too!
You can get to Bugis Street by taking bus opposite the hotel. It's just few stops away.

Location is good, room is small but it's still fine. It's just that the soundproof is really bad, we can hear noises from corridor quite loud when we are inside the room. Besides, I did call reception to make some enquires about vehicle parking ticket, their service provided is low, rude and unprofessional.

Overall it's a pleasant stay with my families in Hotel Boss.

They could have made each room slightly bigger but for profit maximising reasons they chose to make it no more than that of a luxurious prison cell.

Date of stay: February 2017,tml2210,Worst hotel I've ever stayed at,"My partner and I stayed here for 8 nights and without a doubt it was the worst hotel experience of any country I had visited. The room is extremely tiny. It is basically a double bed with about 30cm of space around it. Speaking of the bed, i would have preferred to have slept on the floor in a sleeping bag (if there was actually room to do so). Waking up with lower back pains that take about an hour of stretching and walking around to get rid off is not how I planned my mornings for this holiday. The walls are paper thin so you can hear EXACTLY what the other guests are doing for about 3-4 rooms away. The only thing this hotel has going for it is it's location as it is close to public transport. As other reviews have said, staff are also rude. No reciprocation with the usual ""hey how are you"" but instead just stared blank faced and instructed you to do what they wanted. Don't but tickets for attractions from their stall either. We weren't scammed but they tried to sell us  cable car ticket, ($30 each) as the only way to get to Sentosa. It's really $4 via the Sentosa express which takes about 5 minutes all up. I expect this at road side stalls but not in a ""top"" hotels lobby. Disgraceful. No option to turn the air conditioning off, but instead you can only change the temperature. Situated in such a beautiful city and on the top floor we expected quite a good view at lest. Nope. Our shoebox had a beautiful view of the inside wall of the hotel, where we could see straight into other guests rooms who where lucky enough to be in the same situation as us.

There was almost no floor space left.The was no wardrobe. There was a short metal rail on the wall with 6 coathangers. We asked for an upgrade but the manager advised that all rooms were the same size!! So where did ""premium triple"" come from? The best he could offer to ease our pain was some more coat hangers!!!

Date of stay: January 2017,KFG2004,Does the Hotel Boss care enough?,"My family and I didn't find the Boss Hotel as impressive as I expected. Sure, it's big but also rather impersonal. I found the staff at Reception to be quite efficient but stiff, in contrast to the warm reception afforded in other hotels we had recently visited in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. You pay at Reception upon arrival: I didn't find it very cheap either: our three-day stay was booked nearly a year earlier for just under NZ$500, which is not budget accommodation in my language, considering the distance from the CBD. This rate was inflated when the young man at check-in cheerfully pointed out that there was an extra 17% surcharge for tax purposes (buried in the fine print). That took the account to nearly $600. He found this amusing. The room was very small for three people, with no wardrobe, no Welcome Book to give information on their facilities, and with one small rubbish bin. The bathroom was also small and cramped, with no outlet for the shower steam or other vapours and one roll of toilet paper for three people. The windows don't open, of course. The walls seemed to be thin, as there was a lot of noise from other rooms and the corridor. I found no reference anywhere to laundry facilities so enquired at the desk and was informed brusquely of the DIY laundry on Floor 4, near the pool. A welcome Book in the room could be used to point this out to guests. When we checked out after three days, I received a peremptory ""goodbye""  from the clerk after she had checked that we had no outstanding bills to pay; no little flourish of hoping that we had had a pleasant stay or expressions of goodwill upon our departure, zilch. No bellboy to open doors or lug suitcases around. I got the feeling that it's all about getting the punters in, get their money and tolerate them until they leave.

Room size is extremely Small (I believe this is normal in Singapore) but the room has all the necessary amenities. Bathroom is also compact but the hot shower is the best thing after a tiring day.  The lobby is big.  The front desk area is always crowded with tourists hanging around. There is no wardrobe instead they have only 6-7 hangers in one corner of the room to hang your close.  Breakfast on 4th Level has same Menu almost every day, too many repetitive dishes but they do have choice of Vegetarian menu on breakfast.  BTW Hotel offers two complimentary water bottles in the room and charge 2 Dollar for an extra bottle but on 4th level near the swimming pool they have cold drinking water option so lot of people refill their empty bottles here.If you're looking for a decent price hotel with easy access to transportation and wouldn't mind small room this could be your choice. Taxis are always available in the hotel lobby, Lavender MRT is about 300-400M from Hotel Boss, there is also a bus stop in front of the hotel.

My room is small, but there are other rooms even smaller than ours. Bathroom is also compact. If you're tall or bigger than most asian, you'll find not enough space to move around. I seriously suggest you to look at other hotels or spend more for bigger room. My first night the AC was very cold and we find it hard to understand the AC control panel. The second night, it was not cold but not warm, so i slept with one leg hanging around and the other tucked inside the blanket. Not good.

Date of stay: February 2017,Hal C,"Darth Vader's summer palace has both it's good, and not so good qualities...","First off, yes, from the outside the Boss Hotel looks like where Darth Vader would stay if he came to Singapore.  An austere, angular tower of black reflective glass but not without it's charms.  So let begin with what I liked about it:Good stuff about Boss Hotel-First off, it's cheap.  You should be able to get rooms here all day long on line for about $70 a night Sing.  Cheap is good in an expensive hotel market like Singapore.The rooms are clean and serviced daily and the pool area is really nice with a great view of downtown and, as near as I can tell, no ""closing"" hours.  It's a swimming/bathing pool, good for swimming laps or just having a soak in between sitting in a lounger lying in the sun.  The gardening around the pool area is very well done and there are lots of spots around it in the shade to just hang out if you like.  Also a small, kind of useless gym as is the way of hotel gyms and some $5 coin laundry machines that you can use.  Also, 2 powered massage chairs for a small fee.Downstairs you will find a 24 hour Quickie Mart (not it's real name) and the walk to the Lavender MRT station is under 5 minutes.  In the other direction you can be in the many cafes and shops of the Arab St area in about 5 minutes walking.OK, so that's the good.  Now the not so good:For some bizarre reason the management has decided that the main lobby should smell like someone crashed a golf cart into the perfume mall at an airport before finally landing in a funeral home's floral department.  I could stand the lobby for about 2 minutes at a time.  Perhaps they just don't want too many people hanging around there.  I feel bad for the staff.  But not that bad because the staff are pretty clear that they see way too many people to really bother much with you.  They're polite and efficient in more of a French way than an Asian way...The rooms, while cheap and clean, are also very small (for the cheap ones) and don't more air very well.  Use the toilet right before you leave for the day, if you catch my drift...The wifi is very good and fast, except when it's not.  Don't count on it being there for you right when you need it.  It will be there when it feels like it.  To be fair, it worked well about 80% of the time.  Sometimes it goes out and you actually have to reset the room.  I'm not kidding.  This is what the staff told me to do.  You have to remove the key card from it's holder inside the door until the power in the room goes off.  Then restart it and wait 5 minutes or so.  You might need to turn on the TV to help induce this forced restart.  It will help if you think of your room as an old school desktop PC...I tried the in house restaurant exactly once.  When they told me a glass of tap water would be a dollar with no refills I exited politely while cursing them for cheap bastards under my breath.  There are numerous mediocre food court options just outside in the same building but you'd be much better served taking the short walk to the numerous and highly varied cafes clustered around Arab St or even walk the block to the Lavender MRT station and find many more, much better quality choices there.So overall?  I'd say it's a cheap place in a great location where you get what you pay for.  If you use a hotel room to sleep in at the end of a day of business or sightseeing then this should be fine for you.  If you're looking for a destination resort, you might want to keep looking...",Trip type: Travelled solo,,9 ,10 ,3.0,

There was a tours desk but he offered no help when he realised we were not buying tour tickets.
It was very modern and there was no problem with us registering in at 2am after a flight from Canada, via Hong Kong. ( paid for that night too) There were always taxis waiting in the driveway with a valet helping to call them over and explain where you wanted to go, so language wasnt a problem.
The room was small but contained everything one needed, but not much hanging space or room for the cases. The bed was comfy, AC fine.
Breakfast was included in the foyer restaurant. This was very busy and offered continental as well as some scrambled eggs, viennas and beans. It was more than adequate. We had dinner in the same place, being too tired to walk out, and it offered most western dishes including burgers, sandwiches and salads. There were other restaurants on the hotel location, from traditional chinese to sports bar.

1. excellent location: between 2 MRT stations (Lavender 300+m & Bugis 400+m, direct green line from the airport)
2. good rate taken into consideration good location (short walking distance to Kampong Glam & Arab street - right across the street, Bugis complex of shopping malls & restaurants, Raffles City - the latter is like 20-25 min of brisk walking), free wifi, hotel facilities
3. open swimming pool on the 4th floor (+garden, kids playground, laundromat & ironing zone)
4. ground floor of the hotel's building: 24HR shop (like 7Eleven), food court with various options of cuisines - cheap, 24HR restaurant on the corner.
5. friendly & efficient staff

- drawbacks:
1. the air conditioning: you cannot control it, the system operates on its own, during the night the fan power drops sometimes to 40% (all data on the screen), there is a min temp of 21C
2. noise level: of course, you don't expect fully noise-proof rooms but at 6-7 am all those talkative groups of guests communicating loudly across the whole (very long) corridors make you feel you are sleeping in the fish market in China + if someone moves something like a chair or a suitcase in the room above you you can sharply hear it.
3. towels: there are only 2 big towels for the room, towel for your face. it's manageable, just not convenient

the last thing is not a negative thing, just something for consideration: the hotel rooms in Singapore are not big (if it's not a 5* property) - I could hardly find a spot for pushups. There is no wardrobe, just a number of hangers right above the desk/minibar. (heads up for dresses below the knee).

Only had 3 hooks on the wall---otherwise, the room had no storage either.Our flight got in late.   We had planned to take the subway here but the train from the airport stops running 11:00-11:30 at night.  Stopped at the info desk at the airport and was told to go down one level to the ground transportation desk.  There's a kiosk located there where you can buy a shuttle ride to the hotel.  There was a woman at the desk that can help you with your tickets and a waiting area.  Shuttle driver comes in and calls you.  Got dropped off right at the hotel at 12:30pm. Smooth as can be and  the cost was $9 Singapore dollars each. Also, if you're looking to do a hop on, hop off bus, they pick up right in front of the hotel at the regular bus stop which was so convenient.  The concierge at the hotel has brochures.

Typical hotel room size is relatively small, 18 sq meter inclusive of bathroom. Premier double room with balcony is the biggest room, 28 sq meter. The balcony might be too big for some guests. This hotel offers triple room (3pax) and family room (4pax) as well. The cost per pax is actually the same, except for Premier rooms.

Good points:
1) Location is about 5-7 minutes walk from Lavender MRT station and 2 bus stops from bugis junction/Bugis MRT station. You can reach mustafa centre in 15-20 mins walk.
2) Convenience store, ""CHEERS"", and food court are within the hotel area, you will pass by as you walk towards Lavender MRT station where you can buy tourist pass. You can buy local sim card at the cheers store. The food court is more expensive than KOPI TIAM at Lavender MRT station.
3) SMART TV is provided at every room
4) Many taxis at the hotel lobby - about SGD20 to and from Changi airport
5) Luggage storage is available.

I was prepared for a small room because I had read previous reviews, but I am talking 'you need to consider where to stand before you try to bend over to tie your shoelaces!' Luggage is on the floor taking the entire walking space between the bed and wall.

The hotel is new and modern so at the moment it gets away with it, but there are so many little things missing. Such as no cupboard, drawers or hanging space, only one towel each, no washers or hand towels, one pillow each, no milk with the tea/coffee making, the drain in the shower is positioned in front of the door so the water runs out into the bathroom then back to the drain soaking the whole floor and floormat.

We paid over $120 per night, up to $271, for each night of a 4 night stay over the New Year period.

Our bathroom was unusable due to blocked pipes. I advised reception and notes were made in the computer. After being out all day I returned to find my morning toothbrushing water still sitting at the same high level. A phone call was made to reception. Ninety minutes later a visit was made to reception, whereby I demanded we change room. No apology, upgrade, or assistance with luggage!

Date of stay: January 2017,WorldOyster01,"Didnt work for me, your results may vary","Im not a luxury hotel traveler but I was a bit disappointed by my stay.
Based on total cost with tax approaching $100 US I would say the pluses are
1. good location near downtown and 5 min walk to MTR
2. decent pool (long dimensions for swimmers).
3. Good in-room wifi.
4. Basic mini mall with noodle fast food next door open late possibly 24/7

Now the negatives
1. Be aware these rooms are tiny. The queen bed fits in the room with about 2' or less on the sides of bed and maybe one meter at foot of bed. This is the first time at any price that there were no bed-stands next to bed. Want to put your phone next to your bed? You will have to leave it on the floor. Even though there is dimension for that, no furniture provided.
2.No sound insulation. Doors have gap below but no soundproofing strip. You can hear everything in hall. Luckily neighbor was noisy only one night of 4 stayed
3.Want basic amenities with your room? Think again. No hair dryer, no closet, very limited TV options.There is not even a plastic sign to hang on your door ala do not disturb/clean this room. Speaking of housekeeping....
4.Never before have i received a note on my bed after returning from a long day out to say they could not change linens due to personal items on bed. I guess they didnt want to move my two shirts, afraid to break my shirts ?? I scheduled my room to then be cleaned again. The did change the bed, but they did not leave any soap. Had to call back for soap. The next day again no soap, and cleaners took away the second room key which keeps the room electric on. Luckily the hotel did not charge me the promised $30? fee for a new room key....so i guess i just had bad luck with room service :)
5. Pool is fine but gym... is tiny. While there are several running machines, there is only really ONE work station for weights. Chances are you will be waiting or sharing
6.No quiet common area for inet or meetings. The lobby is big and very noisy. I am not aware of any business center should you need it.
7. Breakfast: after one or two mornings you will ask whether they could do anything different: its very basic and really nothing particularly good. It will get you fed but not much more than that.

If you are choosing this hotel based on location, be aware that Singapore has a great train/bus system which is rather inexpensive, fast and safe. In other words, if you are near any MTR station, you should be fine to get anywhere fast. And taxi or uber cars are quite affordable so dont choose your hotel based on location (in my opinion).

To be fair Singapore hotel known with their small size room, but this hotel is way too small until we hardly move inside the hotel because we have no space to put our luggages.
Lobby is so big and crowded. We had late check in and when first came inside the room, we had the bed sheet with blood stains on it. We request them to changed which took a while, till 3 guys! came to change the bed sheet. Unsure why they need army to change it while actually only 1 guy did the change. Again they still have blood stain in the new sheet, and we have to forced them to changed it again.
Another poor housekeeping happened on the 3rd day as we went back to our room at 10 p.m and found our room had not been cleaned! We went to the receptionist as they did not pick up our call, and they asked us to waited for 1 hour so the housekeeping can clean the room! Even the receptionist was far beyond friendly.

Date of stay: December 2016,ameth_sg,Value for Money - Good Location and Facilities,"We stayed 9 nights in Hotel Boss over Christmas 2016.

For us it was value for money for a good located hotel where the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) is just a few minutes walk from the hotel. We only booked the Superior Double Room and paid an average of 123 SGD per night without breakfast. The room we had was on the 17th floor with a good view of the city and sunrise.

What we found positive in this hotel:
1) Good location near MRT within walking distance (a couple of minutes) and a bus-stop right in front of the hotel.
2) Alot of eating possibilities nearby, including a Cheers convenient store and a food court just next to the hotel. Even near the Lavender MRT station has lots of eating options and a supermarket.
3) As this hotel is rather new (about less than a year as told by reception), its value for money and offers facilities like a pool where you see the Singapore Flyer. There is large outdoor seating area, inhouse restaurant, gym and a laundry area to do your own laundry by paying coins (about 10SGD per load) and ironing facilities. There is also a children playground. All these facilities are located on the 4th floor of the hotel.
4) The room provides a bar fridge, safe, coffee/tea making facilities and hairdryer. Bathroom amenities included (toothbrushes, shower gel/shampoo, shower cap)

What we found not so positive in this hotel:
1) Its really small. There were just the 2 of us and there was hardly any space to walk. After placing 2 pieces of luggages in the room, it was already very full. There wasn't that much space either for your clothes. The bathroom was also very small and compact.
2) As I am a light sleeper, I do hear noises when neighbouring rooms slam the door or even water through the pipes. The solution is to use ear plugs.

In general, I would recommend this hotel to my friends due to the many factors. Before we booked this hotel, we also compared it with Hotel 81 and Santa Grand and finally settled for Hotel Boss.

If one does not spend the whole day in the room, the small size of the room is ok. If one is looking for large bedroom and bathroom space, then this is probably not a suitable hotel.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Zurich,48 ,24 ,4.0,

Breakfast restaurant is way to small and the buffet is mostly asian food, or there is only toast with jam (only 1 flavour...) or an hardboiled egg if asian is not your choice.

There are positieve things to mention; we booked for 3 persons in a 4 person room and there were 3 towels, mugs, complementry waterbottles every day; and this is quite exceptionally I can tell from own experience! There are lots of hotels, including big chain and fancy ones, who would just keep it at the standaard 2 items, regardless by how many persons the room actually will be occupied with.

We got the most basic room but got upgraded to Deluxe, which i probably slightly bigger than the Superior. Basic amenities too so you pay for what you get.

Not much negatives really... Room size is small but i've been to even smaller hotels so size is not really the deal breaker. Perhaps a self-service check-in and check-out would be good for the hotel especially for fuss-free travellers not travelling in groups.

I was served by Vernon. Eight months ago my first visit to your hotel was a bad experience. Most of your front reception staff were very rude, unhelpful and unprofessional with terrible attitude. Last week I was in your hotel again as my wife insisted on choosing your hotel due to your location was pretty convinient.

Surprisingly, I did not expect to received such a excellent service in your hotel. I believed that your management do realize and putting in great efforts on training your hotel staff. Vernon was very well groomed, friendly and professional. He does maintained a very welcoming and positive attitude while serving us. He was also very helpful guiding us patiently on our enquiries. Importantly comparing with my first visit I felt like a ""Customer"" treated with dignity and respect from him.

I was amazed with great improvement on your hotel customer service in such a short period of time. Hope your high level standards of customer service will stay consistency. Hotel should make all customers a memorable experience, services with warm welcome atmosphere.

I will definitely visit your hotel again and sincere appreciation for the service from Vernon.

But it is nearby the MRT station and so close to downtown that you can take taxi to there at a reasonable price and without any hesitation.There is a foot court at the ground floor and ""Fat Hei Ren""Pork soup is found at the Connor of the hotel.They are both open until mid-night.So you will not be worry about at the night when u feel hungry. Besides,you just walk 10 minutes and then will reach the Bugis Street market where there are many ""local foot court"" and hawker shops.

Date of stay: January 2017,Teh M,Inconsiderate staff made my wife angry..,"I am not a big fan of staycations.. But my wife is..  My birthday fell on 31st December and she insisted on another staycation to celebrate..  I just got off the night shift and would have preferred to sleep at home..  Since my wife has booked a room she claims to have a stellar view of the city and maybe the fireworks,  I obliged as my two young kids were excited by the idea of watching fireworks from the balcony.  It was a gathering that involved my parents, siblings,  nieces and nephews.. It was our first time at Hotel Boss.. Despite the fact that the size of the room was much smaller than my bedroom,  the balcony was ideal for gathering,  albeit the poor lighting.  Anyway,  can't see the fireworks,  it was blocked by some of the commercial buildings . I was ready to go home. But my wife still insisted it was a great experience and wished to bring the kids to the pool in the morning. For the kids,  I relented. We all woke up late. My wife called to request for a stay extension till 6 pm at an additional cost of $100. She liked the place. Went to the pool. Kids were hoping for a wading or play pool. But there's none. And unfortunately it started to rain after about an hour. This is where the drama begins. Went back to the room. LOCKED OUT! With shivering kids in tow. Wife called help desk. Spoke to Edna. I couldn't hear the conversation but could see the change in her expression.  It seems that Edna's main concern was telling my wife what the actual checkout time was and asked why my wife why she didn't update the room card when no one informed my wife to. I guess Edna couldn't really empathise with the situation of being locked out in the corridor in swimwear with two freezing kids. Well done Edna! Anyway,  another staff did arrive 10 minutes later to unlock the door for us . Nonetheless,  the damage has been done.The wrath of an angry mother has been incurred and I was at the receiving end of a woman scorned. A piece of advise to all customer service providers. Listen before you speak. By listening, it means to hear with understanding..  Do not listen to reply..  Listen to analyze and then response..  Best staycation locations so far for the family.. .

Date of stay: December 2016,Erika M,Not coming back ever,"Our family has few more days to stay in the hotel but just couldn't wait to write this NOW as we are so frustrated. Didn't really bother to ask for room change as we have lot of baggages on hand. We traveled to quite some countries, stayed and experienced budget, low, mid, and high-end hotels, and this is the first time ever we feel so frustrated staying in a hotel and this isn't even considered a low class hotel.

Don't really care if the hotel improves as we are definitely not coming back here in future regardless whatever pros they have, nor would we recommend it to anyone seeking quiteness at anytime of the day. It just doesn't pay with the frustration we are currently having.

Pros:
- Wouldn't bother to write pros as it's general as what other reviews have mentioned.

Cons:
- Paper thin wall? Nothing the hotel can do about it, so nevermind.

- Small sized room compared with price paid? Nothing the hotel can do about it, nevermind as well.

- Left and right rooms next to ours are people from ""particular"" country. No manner and over loud. Our family just couldn't sleep until they do and must wake up if they do. Did we mention the hotel has paper thin walls?

- ROOM CLEANING SERVICE is utter and absolute chaos? Yes, this is within the hotel's control. We are at Floor 11 but let's just assume all is the same. It feels the room cleaning staffs are not trained about manner working in hotel environment. They are very VERY loud while working and yes we do know a level of tolerance. One staff chat and shout to each other which perhaps 2 rooms away. All of them bang here and there without any consideration of neighbouring rooms. Bang their cart, bang the door, bang the toilet,... Do they even realize the hotel has paper thin wall and doors?

As a tourist, sometimes you just want to take a morning rest as you could have been tired the day before from traveling, but that just won't happen here. All those mean we just HAVE TO wake up every single morning with a very frustrated mind whenever the room cleaning staffs pass, or worse, stop in front of our room to clean the other rooms, and that could come as early as 7:30am. It's absolutely not how we want to start our day in a supposed-to-be a peaceful and fun year end vacation.

We were pleasantly surprised with how great this hotel was, for starters the hotel is very clean and the staff at the front desk are very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and modern and included free wifi, hairdryer etc. I can't remember our floor number but we had a great view over the city below.

Breakfast was included and initially we went to the wrong food hall which was more for local food goers which was up one level near the pool. On the ground floor was our own breakfast hall which was a buffet style offering a selection of hot and cold food and drink. There was a good choice of food and enough variety for the time we were spending in the city. Our last breakfast we ate at a nearby brekkie bar (The Refinery) worth checking this place out in my other reviews!

The pool area was large open and a great place to chill out, we usually grabbed a few beers and paddled about in the water for a good bit. Below and around the hotel were various shops and other small food outlets which were also very handy.

The hotel is near the Lavender subway stop but we also had a wander to Bugis which is only a little longer.

We selected the continental breakfast. It had the usual cereal and toast and some local cuisines etc. The tea was already brewed so you had no tea bags and therefore very weak tea.
The room itself was compact, yet clean. But it missed a few things like no tissue boxes. No bin in the room.

We arrived at the end of a cruise so it was mid morning when we arrived, however the front desk staff let us use the room immediately with no extra charge and gave us a late checkout with nothing further to pay.
There were always a good number of agents on the front desk and you rarely had to queue for anything, what's more all those agents were polite, efficient and friendly.
The bell boys were the same and handled our large amount of luggage with care both on entering the hotel and when looking after it all day whilst waiting for our late flight home.
In fact every member of staff was a pleasure to deal with.

As breakfast is included there are two different locations to eat in, one on the ground floor and one on the fourth floor. You are allocated one of these on arrival so our first morning was on the ground floor which we weren't particularly impressed with. It was very busy, the hot food was only just warm and all in all not a pleasant environment. So the next day we tried the breakfast on the fourth floor. We were kindly informed on arrival that we were allocated ground floor and would have to go to the front desk to change this. I did just that with no fuss from any of the staff involved so we ate on the fourth floor which was an altogether much more pleasant experience with no complaints about any of the food or service. We were told later that the fourth floor was for halal diners!
My advice, ask for the fourth floor breakfast on initially checking in!
The fourth floor also has much larger toilet facilities so if you are getting changed for the airport on your departure day I'd suggest you use these as you do not need your room card to access the fourth floor in the lift.

We stayed for two nights in this modern, clean, friendly and value for money hotel.
My only reservation is the size of the room. Admittedly there were three of us with a lot of luggage coming off a one month trip but even for two people it would have been cramped. There are only two small drawers, one of which contains the hairdryer, there is no wardrobe but there is a metre long hanging rail above the tea and coffee making equipment!
In truth this room size would be suitable for an overnight stay before your early morning flight.
However, in spite of this we did enjoy our time in Singapore and if you are prepared to accept the trade off of room size to cash in pocket then I don't think you will be disappointed!

Finally the taxi fare to the airport for three of us with a lot of luggage was 20 Singapore dollars which included a small tip. Compared to the 60 SGD we had to pay coming off the cruise, it was a bargain.",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Sheffield, England",46 ,80 ,4.0,

Just realised the wifi is good. Nice LCD 37 "" TV. There is a safe box in the drawer good for a 10inch tablet and passports and cash. The rooms are clean.
After booking the hotel for a few nights in 2 rooms they checked out and gave me the rooms' electronic key cards.
I stayed in each room for each night and was shocked. (1). The standard room is small and the design made it claustrophobic. This was in lobby A. Not just for the guest but also for me too. The premier room in Lobby B was marginally better in size. (2). Both bathrooms does not have a bin to throw your toilet or sanitary papers so we have to throw it in the room bin. They do not have toilet paper but a rough tissue which doubles as tissue and toilet paper situated
above the side wall of the toilet bowl. (3). The room insulation is horrendous. We could hear all that is happening in the next rooms. (4).To make things worse the noise was much worse when the off duty staffs were talking so loud as they were returning to their room on the same level after their outing. When i asked them reduce their volume they just ignored and kept talking. The manager confirmed that is the staff staying room. (5). The matteress is hard and not comfortable. (6). Being a budget hotel the shower area is small not for a big size person. My guest had a few knocks while showering and so did I had a few hits. So we need to be extra careful while taking shower. (7).There are no cabinets only railings with few hangers.
I took the opportunity to speak to some 10 guests. None were repeat guests, but they said they will not return due to the noise level that kept them mostly awake and they needed a good sleep and rest when they get back to their home.

Date of stay: October 2016,TShahrizam,Pleasant Stay,"First of all, let me be clear about one thing. space. this hotel is highly recommended for light traveller ONLY. As I was there backpacking, the room that I took was ""just enough"" for my friend and I. We can hardly move inside the room because it was quite small in comparison to other hotel.
If you are travelling with family, it can be quite challenging.

Location wise: superb. I timed my walk for few times from the Hotel to MRT Lavender Station and it took me around 7 to 9 minutes each time. I specifically time my walk so that I can give accurate time as to the walking distance. There are also food stalls below the hotel and at the MRT station.

For Muslim traveller, you can easily find Halal restaurants nearby (walking distance) and it is very easy to find them. I even walked to Mustafa Center (Bugis Area) in the morning for breakfast and some shopping at Mustafa Center. But walking to Mustafa Center from the Hotel is not recommended if you are travelling with kids or senior citizen because it is quite a distance.

The room was clean, wifi was considerably fast and they have satellite TV. Check in was smooth sailing and I even had my friend checked in for me because he arrived in Singapore with earlier flight. I just email them the request and they attended to my request promptly. I have to give thumb up to their customer service for excellence service.

the hotel is down as a three star so I will review it on that basis
position
250mt from lavender station (there is an elevator so no steps) the walk to the hotel is up a slight slope but manageable
there is a bus stop outside that goes downtown to clarks key bugis and china town
we got the shuttle there didn't need to book went to the shuttle desk at the airport
cost 11 dollars each. we thought about the train but there was a change of trains en route so we opted for the bus
there is an opal card which you can by at the airport which allows unlimited travel for trains and buses for 3 days
the hotel is a couple of years old and modern the rooms are on the small side but very comfortable, clean and well appointed including fridge, tea making gear, a good shower a firm comfortable bed and excellent aircon, we didn't use the restaurant or bar
there was a very nice big swimming pool and sun deck on the fourth floor (in the open air) the staff were very polite and informative
there is a small food hall and mini mart on the ground floor next to the hotel but we preferred walking down to the station there is a good food hall and stalls behind the station and a MacDonald's if you walk through the arcade and bear right there is a supermarket if you need one
we used the train to get back to the airport (about 5 dollars) it was quick (37 mins) and easy the pavement down to the station is easy to wheel cases on.

Date of stay: November 2016,Edward D,The Boss gives no service.... only takes charges..  :). Very uncomfortable stay.. checked out very next day.,"I was doing a Singapore-Malaysia-Singapore trip with family.
On the first leg stayed in Holiday Inn,Orchard Road and on the second leg booked hotel boss due to its very good location to Little india, etc.
I booked the hotel on booking.com... the pics looked great. Made a big mistake in booking this one as Holiday Inn was not available and this one had a good location to the sites we intended to visit.
was traveling and returning from Malaysia with family and when we landed at the hotel, it was late night.. Nobody helped with the luggage. We were told that nobody was there to bring the luggage to the room.
No issues with that.. After being issued a room, we trolled with our bags to the room.

Now the room given was stinking with some chemicals, when inquired about the same, we were told that chemicals were used to treat the smoking smell from previous guests.
I had booked a non-smoking room, so why the hell give us a smoking room. But anyways they managed to give another room but that too on the same floor. there was still the smell of that chemical, but not much in the room..As we were very tired from our long day, had no choice but to just crash.

The rooms are very small, even though we took the triple room.. I don't mind the rooms being small, but for the rate of S$240 + taxes i paid per night, there was no place to keep our bags, no cupboard... Maybe booking.com gave me a higher rate or this hotel.

The rooms are very noisy, meaning i could hear the toilet flush in the adjacent room from my bed.. could not sleep. early in the morning, had some very noisy guests..
The wall are made of some wood and not completely concrete, so guess that why the sound travels from the next room.

The breakfast spread that day was average.. and didn't feel like eating anything
The staff at the restaurant is very unfriendly or maybe no courtesy.

Some Indian staff were courteous enough, so I called my friend for coffee.
I immediately checked out from that hotel, even though i had to pay a penalty of one day extra.. but I managed to get the booking in Park Royal, Beach Road and that was a relief for us. Our good experience in Singapore continued.

So Hotel Boss... don't be a Boss.. teach your staff to show some respect and courtesy to guests.
Your rooms are tiny, your service is miserable, your bills are big.
Stepping into Hotel Boss, almost ruined my experience of Singapore.

I do not recommend this hotel to anybody, unless they manage to get some cheap deals...I have stayed in much better.. so I know the difference.

This hotel should be classified as a budget hotel and not a mid-range.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Mumbai, India",12 ,7 ,1.0,

It appears that the balcony rooms face inward in the Hotels triangle configuration.
The hotel is between the two Green line train stations, Lavender and Bugis.
The distance from Lavender Station to the hotel is about 250 meters.
From Lavender Station to Changi airport train station is about 20 minutes, with a change at the second last station before Changi. The trains run every 3 or 4 minutes. Tickets are available at every station, including Changi airport.
The hotel is fairly close to the city area.
Train travel is cheap as are the taxis.
Breakfast is $S12 per person. Limited range but filling. Eggs, only scrambled, fruit juices, toast white/brown, watermelon, and rock mellon (canterlope)
Tea and coffee, milk and cereals, sausage‚Äôs, and other items.
No waiting queues, a pleasant start to the day.
Our only comments about all the staff , is they were very polite and professional
in their tasks, including the cleaning and housekeeping staff.
The swimming pool is lovely, about 4 foot deep all over.
There are a number of other eating places and shops as part of the hotel complex including a ‚Äú7-11‚Äù or as they call it ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù mini grocery , and a money changer, which is very competitive.
On the minus side, we found that the tours deck was only manned part time and no brochure rack to inform tourists of the cities attractions.
There is a taxi rank right at the door, with bell hop staff to help, all under cover.
The rooms are on the small side, but we only slept there. (out every day)

The facilities and service were very good especially the pool. The rooms aren't  big, but perfectly adequate for a couple. The bathrooms are a bit small but manageable. Unfortunately the beds are hard and not a pleasure to come back to after a long day out. The breakfast which was included in the tariff is pretty basic and not that tasty or offering much of a range. Would have been better with a few more options of tea and hot water, cereal, spreads and fruit, but as everything is imported and a tropical climate catering for more the local population it's understandable. We took ear plugs which helped with some of the noise you notice when staying in a new location, and we went out and bought some honey, bananas and jasmine tea bags from a local shop to make up for that lacking at breakfast. Our room (937) was near a corner where there are outdoor patios on every second floor, so we were kept awake as someone was partying into the early hours on the floor above.

The check-in/out was very fast and smooth eventhough there are so many guests in the lobby. Thanks to Falla in the frontdesk for being so welcoming and energetic. She was smiling to me all throughout. she tried her best to accommodate some of my questions and requests. kudos to the hotel for training her very well. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends visiting Singapore.,,,6 ,3 ,,4.0
Date of stay: October 2016,ifzzz,"New, convenient, clean and modern","Made this hotel my home for 11 nights because my home was under renovation. The room is small, but it has everything you need for a basic hotel stay. And it is a new hotel!  There's no view from my room and better to draw down the blinds for privacy.  My nose was happy that flooring is not carpeted.  I booked the room directly from the hotel website which offered the best valued price as compared to other hotel websites at that point time.  The location is awesome for me since my work place is very nearby.   However, the location is awesome to many great places too. The bus stops near the hotel can reach many places.  Some places of interest are reachable by foot too.- Bugis Junction is 3 bus stops away (from bus stop opp hotel)- Lavender MRT Station is 2 bus stops (bus stop just outside hotel).  - Arab Street is reachable diagonally across the road from the hotel. - The 24 hrs Mustafa Centre is 10 mins walk away.- Golden Mile Food Centre @ Beach Road (locally known as Army Market) is 9 mins walk away (There's a self service laundry shop in that area too.  The same area has a famous Koothurar Nasi Briyani @ Blk 17 and an old school local bakery, Sembawang Confectionery @ Blk 6) I don't think the hotel breakfast is not fantastic - skip it and save the money for better, cheaper breakfast.  The food court downstairs has better options -  I enjoyed my kaya toast, eggs and tea/coffee set there on most mornings..   Or if you can walk a bit, the North Bridge Road Food Centre is nearby (7 min walk) for you to experience a local morning breakfast.The founder bak kut teh downstairs of hotel is great for a Singaporean breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Opposite the hotel (Blk 462) there's a nice, cosy cafe with great coffee and pasta (Tolido's Espresso Nook) and an old school seafood restaurant (Nan Hua Chang Seafood Restaurant) which sells decent fish head steamboat and local zi char (wok-fried) dishes.

Breakfast Dreadful,"The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the aroma of floral notes, although slightly overdone, is refreshing when coming from the outside humidity and heat. The rooms are modern, although incredibly small with only towels provided, no face washers. We had the supposed superior twin room. I would hate to have had the standard room, I don't think we would have been able to move in room at all. We were aware the rooms were small but didn't realise quite how small they were, nether the less the room was some what comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. The buffet breakfast on the other hand was nothing at all to be desired. All the food was cold and the food options were that you would expect at a soup kitchen. There was no fresh juice, just cordial, to be honest everyone in the restaurant looked miserable with there breakfast. We couldn't even eat ours it was that bad. And the measly 2 options for spreads  (served in a squeeze bottle) wasn't exactly fabulous.

Good, safe location, walking distance to the subway line, also 20 min walking to the shopping area Golden Mile. The room was neat and clean, but extremely tiny, like there was no space even to put the luggage. It was also very dark as the window was looking inside the hotel, where I felt claustrophobic. Staff was not so kind to change the room, but offered payed upgrade, which I did not require as such. They have also beautiful pool with a great view, if you want to spend time relaxing in the hotel. Food court by the hotel is not so nice, but there is also a shop, which is helpful. Being first time in the city and as a guests in this hotel, staff was not friendly to assist even the simpliest questions how to get where, they would redirect you to the concierge, who wouldn't even know best ways to get around and would overall confuse you. They also managed to send me to the travel desk, but the person just refused to answer any questions unless I buy a trip from him. I felt this is not acceptable.

Date of stay: October 2016,bkkfreeambulance,"Modern, compact, clean, great wifi speed, convenient, value for money","For Singapore, the price was good for what you got. Check in was less than 2 minutes! Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Room was clean, modern, hi-speed wifi but it did stop for a few hours one night because of the provider (apparently). Very small but I like this style. So convenient to food courts, and MRT 200 meters away. Pool was lovely too. A really nice hotel in walking distance to Bugis, Little India, lesser known Mediterranean quarter, and if you are a more serious walker, Marona Bay area (Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, etc.). We had a view of the Singapore Flyer (ferris wheel) and the Gardens by the bay (we could actually see the light show!).

Honestly everything was excellent EXCEPT............ the noise!!!!!! OMG, you can hear everything in the corridor, it's like an amplifying chamber! I'm just talking about regular conversation can be easily heard. I heard an Australian couple whispering outside my room as they came home late. The noise is just unbelievable! You can hear water rushing down the pipes, the lifts, just everything. It's by far the noisiest hotel I have ever been at and Im sure I will never find one like this again.
That, in combination with Indian groups (I've heard other people complain about Chinese groups), at midnight shouting down the corridor to each other was just a nightmare! The staff DID respond to my call and sent someone up who asked the people to be quiet but they were still walking backwards and forwards opening and closing doors all night. On that first night I thought my holiday would be ruined for lack of sleep BUT.... the next morning my hero Mr. William Lew, the day manager immediately responded to my request to move rooms and he spent some time trying to find me a quieter room. His intent was very much appreciated but alas the hotels design is such that I do not think there is anywhere in the hotel that is truly quiet. Staff were trying so hard to control the situation but they are fighting a loosing battle. The blame lies either with the architect or owner of the building who allowed such a construction to have taken place. I would say this is a prime example of how NOT to build a hotel. So sad because everything about the hotel is great including the lovely staff. I do not envy their job but i DO appreciate your efforts to try and keep everyone happy. Thank you very much.

So, finally I had a room that for the most part was quiet enough to sleep but I slept with the TV on so noises from outside were less of a shock when sleeping.
If you stay here try ear plugs (possibly industrial grade) or something similar. If you can handle the incredible noise from all directions and guests who have no clue about courtesy then I would definitely recommend it.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Bangkok, Thailand",73 ,31 ,3.0,

I was a solo traveller visited Singapore for 3 days. I used Agoda to book Superior double room, which had the option to pay at the hotel. (Because i didn't have credit card, i used my visa debit card to reserve the room)
Due to 2 hours delay of my flight, i reached Changi Airport at 10.00am. After coming out from the terminal, i could easily find the MRT station. From the station, i took MRT card and waited for down town line train to come. Within 30 minutes, i got off from Lavender MRT station. From their, i walked 450m to the Hotel Boss at 11.00am, which is at the same side if the road.

The front desk guy was pleasant and checked me in. Paid S$236 for two nights. That is really nice to have early check-in as the normal check-in time is at 2.00pm, without any extra charge.
First he gave me a room at 6th floor and i requested higher floor. Then he kindly checked me into 19th floor, which is the top floor with great view of the city. I could see the gardens by bay and the flyer from the room.

The room is small, but as i was solo, it was perfect. But i think couples can even fit into the room easily. But not for two individuals. Then you can get into different room category.

Wifi, hot water, electronic safe, electric kettle, hair dryer, flat screen LED tv with 15 channels were perfect.
But no iron board or iron. You need to go to 4th floor for that, where the pool is in.

Best thing in this hotel is the location.
700m to Mustafa center
900m to Bugis MRT
450m to Lavender MRT

You can find many cheap and good restaurants around the street here which are open till 10.00pm.

Date of stay: September 2016,Wendy K,Convenient location,"I chose this hotel as it was reasonably priced, a fairly new property and it was close to a MRT station. On arrival the hotel looks very nice, the reception staff are reasonably friendly and the location is good. It's a little way out of the centre but all you need do is hop on the train at Lavender and you are in the heart of Singapore quickly. The location is good for a wander through the Arab and little India districts, which are walking distance. There are a few bars and eateries located along the canal that is beside the hotel. The rooms are of a minimalist design, a bit on the small side and are spotlessly clean. The pool area is good, with plenty of space to sit and spread out. Wifi worked okay. Now for the negatives, which is a shame as it could be a great hotel. The rooms are compact, so storage is limited, there is no wardrobe and hanging space is above the bench. There are no bedside tables to rest a book, a cup of tea etc on. I had to move the chair to the side of the bed for this. The beds are hard and I actually developed a sore back from sleeping on the beds. The walls are thin and I could hear the comings and goings in the hallway which was frustrating when trying to go to sleep. The complimentary toiletries did not include a separate conditioner and no shower cap. The lighting in the room & bathroom was incredibly harsh, and as it has been mentioned in a review below, it is exactly like working under operating lights in theatre (to which I actually do) and no good for putting on makeup. I think the light globes need to be replaced with something a little less harsh. The hairdryer provided is actually attached inside a drawer, which is okay but the cord is far too short. I am 5'3 tall and even with my height I had to sit on the bed to blow-dry my hair, with what seems to be the equivalent of a resistance band. To make blowdrying your hair even more uncomfortable, the mirror isn't located above the drawer, so you are adding more stretch on the cord. There is no toilet roll holder as toilet paper is dispensed like tissues from a dispenser that is far too high. Finally, breakfast was absolutely appalling, I've stayed at a lot of hotels and this is the second time I have not wanted to return to eat the breakfast.

Room itself was comfy and clean (hotel only about a year old). Sprang for a balcony which was really sizable. Not much of a view there (facing neighbors) but it'll do as a chill out spot.

Date of stay: October 2016,joesweg,Great place to stay,"I had read mixed reviews about Hotel Boss, so was a bit unsure about what to expect.
For us it was a great place to stay. It is a new hotel and the rooms were very pleasant. Yes the rooms are small, but they were adequate. We had a triple room which probably provided us with a bit more room. The beds were very comfortable.
We found our room to be very quiet (didn't hear anyone in the adjoining rooms). It certainly was a busy hotel in the foyer, but wasn't ever a problem. We had a city view from our room which was awesome.
The hotel staff were very friendly and were helpful. They attended to any of your needs promptly.
Hotel facilities were good. The pool and surrounding deck was a lovely area to relax. Pool temperature was great. We also ate breakfast at the Level 4 restaurant which was reasonably well priced, good variety, and lovely surroundings.
We used the money exchange facility on the hotel premises and got good rates with no commission. We also ate at the food court (Food Clique) and were very happy with the quality and price of the food.
Location was fantastic. Short walk to Lavender MRT, buses stop outside of the hotel, and it was very easy to catch a taxi at the hotel. It was also very close to Kampong Glam and the Arab quarters, and a pleasant walk to Bugis Street markets. It is also quite close to Little India.

The hotel also have a good area..you can easy to find food, mart,monet changer,gift shop and cafe.. all this you can find direct to around hotel building..and the best place i like in the back or beside the hotel you can see a big park..you can enjoy the morning or evening there.

Maybe for advice or dislike ( not to dislike too ) the breakfast always same when i stay there for 5 day.need more variations,but the food good. And the room maybe not to big but very small for 4 star hotel above $130/night sgp. And not provide slipper in the room.

So far i love this hotel..maybe next time i will stay here again ..soon. see you then..
Im already miss Singapore again.. :(

Date of stay: September 2016,Duc696chic,New but Disappointing,"The best thing about this hotel is the staff, location and the cleanliness because it is new. However the amenities leave a lot to be desired.

The rooms are very small even compared to nearly every other hotel we have stayed in around the world, there are no wardrobes or drawers for your clothes to put away only a very small shelf with a rail under on the wall to the right above the TV.

If there are two of you in the room you will struggle to hang enough clothes here and with no other furniture other than a desk you are required to live out of your suitcase (not really how you want to be on a vacation).

The little shops, massage beauty centre and restaurants are not owned by the hotel so you cant book any services to your room not a big deal until you want some ice which they ran out of as it was warm and many wanted ice for their drinks.

The pool is very clean and refreshing, there is no lifeguard, and no children's pool so if you have small children and you want to be able to cool off after a days adventures this isn't the pool for you. (the childrens play gym isnt near the pool either)
(we were not travelling with kids this trip)

We had a problem where one of our travelling party slipped over poolside walking back to the seating area, the hotel couldn't offer any first aid services, no ice packs, bandages or medical cleaning supplies which resulted in us having to buy ice from the restaurant and making a makeshift icepack with a plastic shopping bag.

We also had many problems with all of our room keys continuously losing there access and having to go up and down to reception to get them replaced. (they were not kept near phones or other magnetic cards)

The taxi service from the hotel is quite well organised, however having a small sign in this area for people who are waiting on pick ups for private tours would be a huge improvement and save drivers having to walk around the lobby questioning people until they find the right ones.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful but limited to what they could provide.

Still significantly cheaper than the ""fancy"" hotels in the downtown area, and much more modern, clean and pleasant than most of the cheap small places. Rooms are pretty tiny but functional, you can walk around the bed and that's about it. Bathroom is quite nice and not too small. Never had any problems with noise (15th floor so no outside noise, inside could hear people in the corridor on occasion but never heard my neighbours in 3 weeks). A 2 minute walk to Lavender MRT and of course your Uber can drive right into the taxi stand underneath the building if it's raining. Only thing missing, especially for longer staying guests, is a fix for the Do-Not-Disturb / Please-Make-Up-Room system. Now you have to either call reception to arrange it, or get your doorbell rung every day by housekeeping, if you are not actually out the whole day.

Their room is opposite to mine and at least 10 steps away. How can their voice be so clear? I can totally listen every single word of their conversation, seriously what is wrong of your insulation !!!",Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Hong Kong, China",2 ,14 ,3.0,

Date of stay: April 2016,Laura d,"Good choice for money, very nice pool and breakfast","The Hotel Boss is centrally located, walking distance from Little India and near a subway station.

We were a group of 4 and we all had a good impression. Clean hotel, TV and wifi worked properly but the best was the pool in the roof, with good views to the city! It was great going in for a dip after a day touring around the place. Everything was well maintained too. Breakfast was nice, varied, with international products - fact that we very much appreciated as we felt a bit fed up from rice, chicken and asian food in general after a few days.

Rooms are very small but they do have everything one might need. Next to the reception there's a guy with who'm you can book several excursions. We had big expectations for the night safari and it was an absolute mess. Be ready to see no animals and just wonder around in a kids train through the ""jungle"".

All in all a good stay for good money. Recommended!

I have never stayed in any hotel/motel around the world and encountered this. Very frustrating for my wife when she wanted to wash and dry her hair. The bed in our room was akin to sleeping on a board. Very hard and not very comfortable. I understand this establishment is only 12 mths. old high makes my experience even more disappointing.

From my experience the rooms had a few faults. The wifi didn't work at peak times especially at night. The T.V was laggy in the room i stayed in and at one stage the toilet continued to let water run. However Hotel Boss staff always were happy to fix these problems so it was no problem.

The lobby is always packed with people, but there are plenty of staff at the front desk so its not an issue. However I found most of the hotel grounds to be quite noisey, including my room.

I thought the location was great, its near Arab St and Haji Lane so there are plenty of places to eat at around the area. The hotel is right next to lavendar MRT which is a plus. And there is also a food centre right next door to the hotel which serves good chicken rice. If you're considering doing the hop on hop off bus there is also a bus stop right outside Hotel Boss which the hop on hop off bus stops at. There is also a money changer right next door to the hotel.

Date of stay: July 2016,Laura S,Good Location. Modern & Well Equipped. Small Rooms.,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Boss for 4 nights. This was our first trip to Singapore and we found this hotel to be very located, a few mins walk from Lavender MRT. We actually walked all the way from the hotel to the Marina one day in about 30-40 mins but thought it was a great way to see the city. The lobby is impressive (and smells lovely!) and the check-in was super quick and efficient. The highlight for me was the pool and roof terrace...the views are amazing, especially at night and there is plenty of room with chairs and tables set out so you can enjoy an evening up there. We didn't get chance to visit any of the restaurants or food court on the bottom of the hotel but they all looked good from the outside.

The size of the lobby and the terrace in this hotel is quite surprising given how small the rooms are. However, we managed just fine in a Standard room as we didn't spend much time in there and it was very clean and well equipped. The Smart TV and WiFi worked brilliantly. It was quite noisy with the sounds of people coming in and out of their rooms though. We travelled with a lot of luggage and were able to leave some of our bags that we didn't need for Singapore in the luggage storage area for the duration of our trip without any problems...this actually saved us some room!

Overall, I would recommend this hotel as the location and facilities are very good and it is clean and modern. Just make sure you know what you're getting when it comes to room size!",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",3 ,1 ,4.0,

Hotel both look and feel is good

Checkin was too fast, even we came one hour earlier they allowed us to take room mostly they won't allow as they follow strict timings on 02pm checkin..

Services are fine and good they are very help full and friendly

Food as we have booked hotel with free break fast every day as long as we stay.. But for Indians specially for vegetarians there is no proper food only u have adjust with bread and butter... Rest of all items are made up of non veg.. So non veggies can warp it up üòâ

Traveling so convenient to Lavender,MRT and buses as they are very near and walkable distance from hotel

Pool and gym are available at this hotel we can use it free and fun

Little India is near when u travel by MRT if u travel by bus it will take at least 20-25min to reach..

Over all my reviews are very good and smooth hotel and yes I will stay again..

If you can get past that then this is a fantastic place to dump your bags and explore Singapore. It actually makes you get out and make the most of your time rather than sleeping in!

Date of stay: June 2016,Gavin,Overall great place to stay!,"My stay with Hotel Boss was great overall.

Positives:

The location is very convenient. You can visit places like Mustafa, Orchard Road and Bugis Street with ease, either by public transport or taxi. The ground floor holds many stores containing most things you may require. An ample variety of food choices in a clean food court called Foodclique is available for decent pricing.

As for the breakfast buffet, it is quite western. They do not serve pork or lard in any way. There's a nice swimming pool up on the 4th floor.

The rooms are clean too. Wi-Fi is great and free. Each individual room has it's own access point and therefore the signal is high (5/5 or 4/5 bars). Download speed averages upto 30 Mbps and upload speed upto 20 Mbps. In short, very fast and no latency.

Service was smooth and great. Hotel staff were friendly, helpful and super responsive. I definitely recommend, and personally do see myself staying in Hotel Boss again in my next visit to Singapore.

Mild Cons:

The following did not bother me much however by observation the room was quite small-ish (Triple Room with Breakfast), including the bathroom as well. For one person staying it is more than enough but for three adults, it can feel a bit crowded. If you have many luggages, you may find it inconvenient due to the lack of space.

Date of stay: June 2016,montydb,A disappointment,"I have reviewed a number of hotels for Trip Advisor and have been able to make a review easily. In the case of this hotel it is very difficult because aspects of the hotel vary from good to very poor.

From outside the hotel is a gleaming triangular shaped blue glass covered structure with a wide paved patio area on the river side of the hotel. This area has been landscaped well and is attractive. Similarly on the outside swimming pool floor which again is a landscaped patio area and is ideal for swimming, sunbaking, or relaxing in the shade.

Internally things change. The foyer is large with minimal seating and there is no communal lounge area. The foyer is extremely noisy and busy as the hotel clearly markets to Indian etc tour groups.

The rooms on the outside have excellent views over the surrounding area but those facing the inside face into a dim dismal area.

The rooms are small with no storage areas other than a couple of drawers in the basic work desk. A rod protrudes from one of the walls is for hanging clothes. Other features are as described on their website. The bathroom is tiny and will serve one person at a time. Noise levels are high at night with many noisy guests arriving at all hours. Laundry is not provided but at cost washer/dryers are provided on the swimming pool floor..

The breakfast would rate as one of the worst I have experienced. It is minimal with low quality food and appears to be set up mainly for Indian/Asian guests. Most of what was offered was luke warm. This was made worse by the attitude of a number of guests pushing and shoving and taking far more food than they could cope with. The breakfast room is also far too small for the size of the hotel. No other restaurant or coffee shop is provide although a number of cafes have been established in independent shops on the outside of the hotel.

The hotel is not expensive for Singapore and seems to be attracting economy based guests.

Despite the glamorous exterior I would have to classify The Boss as a semi-upmarket backpacker hotel. It may be appropriate for younger people on a budget but can not be recommended for older more discerning guest5.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",40 ,40 ,2.0,
Date of stay: June 2016,pamy_arte,Fine hotel at Lavender St.,"Lobby: Spacious, lavish and updated. Guests not greeted by the employees. Receptionists were fast and efficient. Washroom is located outside the lobby.

Room: I booked for a Superior room non-smoking for 4D3N located at 15th floor and adjacent to the elevator. It was a bit noisy because we can hear guests walking around. Room is cozy yet small, but clean and fresh; very basic. Room service is quite good; they cleaned up our room for 3 days. I have no problem with our room.

Others: We haven't checked other amenities like restaurant, fitness centre, and swimming pool.

Overall:
My fiance and I were satisfied with this hotel. We love to walk around and use SG public transportation. Location is very nice, accesible to MRT (Lavender Station) and with bus station at the back of the hotel. Fit for solo, couples and business travellers. Not really for big groups and with children.

The hotel was very busy when i 1st arrive but very happy when the staff already check me in even though is only 9am in the morning...
The room was actually better then i expected. (Compare to my last stay in other hotel) water bottle was in the room which is a bonus. the bathroom was spacious enough and they even provide basic amenities.
Space wise is quite limited to b honest for 2 of us with 2 bags is already taken up the space on the floor. So everytime we when out we have to keep our suitcase close and stand it upright.
Alert for light sleeper that this hotel has very thin wall...i can hear what happen next door if they just talk a little louder or on the tv with high volume..but so far my sleep is still ok...bed is comfy enough for me.

Great location - close to Lavender MRT. The rooms were tiny, but very modern and clean. 1 room had excellent view while the other had no view but good balcony.
Unfortunately there were 2 negatives: other tourists were rude, unhygienic and took over the pool and eating areas (hotel staff couldn't do much about that though). Also, the buffet breakfasts were poor. Terrible selections and terrible taste (both standard and Halal).

Cons: from time to time key card would not work. Had to travel from lobby to room floor to get it fixed (5 times to say the least). Staff were not very accommodating. I had my parents on different floor and could not see them as you aren't allowed to go to other floors. Meaning i had to go to the lobby to meet them (like seriously!)
Room service was not as prompt. Needed to call to remind again.
Room was small. Not enough place after placing 2 big luggages in the corner.

No bedside table. Toilet paper placed above and behind the toilet so you have to struggle to get to it? Well this is the place for you. Ok so that's the negative stuff out of the way. On the positive the hotel is a good base for a budget explorer. Downstairs there are many businesses aimed at travellers which compensate for the lack of anything in the rooms.

Date of stay: April 2016,rover257,Good central hotel,"Stayed just one night at Boss Hotel for last day in Singapore on our way home from a SEA tour. Happy with the hotel - our room on a high floor was pretty small but had everything you needed and had fantastic views over the city. Hotel was very easy to get to from Lavender MRT station - about a 5 minute walk. When we arrived things were super busy, with the lobby area a bit of a zoo but we found the reception staff courteous and helpful and check-in only took a few minutes. We arrived sort of late and there weren't a lot of dining options available so we just bought some snacks at a shop up the road and used the tables on the terrace around the attractive 2nd floor pool area to have something to eat/drink.There seemed to be lots of others doing the same thing. Next day the helpful concierge staff held on to our cases until that evening so we could tour around the city. To be honest the baggage holding area beside the vehicle drop off/pick-up point didn't look that secure but we experienced no problems - assume the staff kept an eye on things. Our experience of Singapore was pretty good in this regard anyhow - we accidentally left a camera on a park bench in the botanic gardens only to find it being handed in to one of the park offices by a local woman some time later - refreshingly honest people :-)",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,Ireland,130 ,109 ,4.0,

As far as it being a hotel, that is a bit of a joke. The rooms are absurdly small & water pressure is so low it won't wash out my razor in the shower!! The climate control in the room is limited to turning the air-conditioning up and down. A couple of things I do like about it - internet (35Mbps dn, 15 up), the TV has internet radio and decent sound, my maid was very flexible about when I requested service and very pleasant.There is almost no place to put your stuff. The room is so small that the luggage stand makes it difficult to get to the end of the bed. In fact, there is not enough room that you can sit on the corner of the bed and put your shoes on! And it does not end there, I went to the work out room. The Precor elliptical is one of my favourite cardio machines. But they have got  a special version for dwarves!! You would literally have to be  a small child to use it! I usually go to the gym early - 5ish. The gym is hard to find because it is not well marked and they have that nonsense were saving money by not having  a light on mularky. So while I am searching for the gym, it appears that a bunch of vagrants has come to the pool area to sleep on the furniture and bathe in the pool. Apparently this is sop here since when I went to breakfast, there were vagrants right outside the restaurant still sleeping on the furniture at 7 am. Almost as disgusting as the breakfast! The breakfast is just lousy and the only actual breakfast food was overcooked scrambled eggs and toast. Others have commented on the toaster that does not toast correctly and it still does not. This tells you that the responses from management are just lip service. Note: I have spent a lot of time in Singapore & you can find a lot of really terrific food but a really good breakfast is not one of them. There are hoards of large groups of children here. It did not bother me so much but they are kids and as such need to be managed to do things like not block up walkways, lounge areas, etc. The noise insulation in these rooms is hideously bad. It almost seems to amplify as I can here every word spoken up and down the hall!!Some have commented on how great the price of this place is. Frankly if you plan ahead and search Expedia or Booking, it is no problem to find a much better place for a similar if not lower price that includes a breakfast. I ended up here as an experiment for my boss who thought we'd try it out as he has a large group of family coming in August‚Ä¶Hotel ""Boss"" failed the test and btw I can't believe they don't get sued for using what is a clear attempt at scamming the Hugo Boss brand.",Trip type: Travelled on business,,94 ,56 ,1.0,

Date of stay: May 2016,travellingricky,Its a new hotel but not a luxury hotel,"Ok, with the high prices of hotels in Singapore, travelers want good value for their money. Hotel Boss is one of the newer hotels in Singapore. We booked the hotel because of the nice pictures on their web site, but don't let the pictures fool you! The room is no big enough to open your suitcases, unless you open them on one of the beds. The bathroom has no toilet paper, only a large tissue box mounted above the toilet, you better get a few tissues before sitting down, because they are out of reach otherwise. There was no closet, not enough hangers so we had to buy our own at the local shops. Bring a power strip as there are not enough outlets for charging all your devices.

The hotel is in Lavender. If you are not on a tour, there is nothing around there to see except for a 5 minute walk to the Lavender MRT station. Not a good way to visit Singapore if it is your first time. When our taxi pulled into the lobby area, we saw all Indian and Chinese tour groups staying there. The lobby gets real crowded and noisy when the busses all arrive. It is a big hotel that packs people in, so it is bust nearly all the time. If you are adventurous you can take the local busses from the hotel to Orchard Road, the main shopping area. The busses are clean, efficient, and cheap. When you travel like a local you can get around much easier.

Skip the hotel restaurant, although the menu looks inviting, for the 4 nights we stayed there we saw no one in the restaurant except the staff. A better deal is to walk next door to the food court, cheap and tasty, and large enough to dine in comfort. Seems like many of the guests at the hotel if not on a tour meal ticket, ate there. We had our lunch and dinners, and late night snacks there at the food court.

Would I come back here as a tourist? Probably not, given what I just said above, it is far away from the center of action and you would be better off paying for a better situated hotel near Orchard Road.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",14 ,21 ,3.0,

Bed was on the small side for a major chain, dental kits and shower gels good. Bathroom again a bit small.

That's a thumbs up. The check in and check it process was fast. The room was pretty clean and the bed was comfortable. However there were stains and a hole in the comforter (but it doesn't really matters). The smart TV was awesome with cable movie channels! The view was good. The room's wifi signal is strong. Location was good, near MRT, there's Cheers.

The bad part of the stay was that the room was not sound proof, I could hear other guests' talking and their movements. That's relatively annoying and disturbing especially at night. I could hear children screaming and things dropping. It will be good if something can be done to improve the sound proof of the room! Also, it will be good if the staffs could be more hospitable rather than just having the ""I just wanna get my job done"" attitude. Smile more maybe?

Date of stay: June 2016,Peter R,Good for 1 to 2 night stay only.,"New modern looking hotel appears fantastic from the outside. Great location and very near to the Lavender MRT.
Check In was quick and easy. No problems here.
I went up to my room on the 17th floor, opened the door and laughed....... The room is tiny. Measurements are 3m x 3m. 1 x double bed, 1 x bed side table, 1 x desk chair and TV on the wall. No room to put 2 x suitcases down. 1 stayed on the floor and the other on a fold up stand they provide. No lounge to sit comfortably.for 2 people. The walls are paper thin and everything going on in the room next door and the corridor can be heard.
The bathroom is small. I mean very small. Im a large person and the is not a great deal of room in the shower. There is no toilet paper. They provide tissue paper. Tip. Bring your own toilet paper
Rooms are tidied up daily however. They don't change the towels (unless you ask) or swap out the dirty cups for clean ones. After house keeping had been, I found a very long hair in one of the cups. Not very good. They do replace complimentary bottled water each day and top up sugar and coffee. No milk but milk powder. Tip.....buy you own
Buffet Breakfast is a disappointment. I went on day one and and had toast with scrambled egg and baked beans. (No bacon) All cold. No orange juice but orange cordial. No pork is is in breakfast range which is very disappointing given that they have a Halal restaurant on lvl 4 for our Muslim friends. They aren't really catering to there western customers but only to pork restricted faiths. Tip. Have breakfast out somewhere else. For lunch on day 2 I had Seafood fried rice and no complaints at all here . Was very nice.

Overall the hotel presents very nice, is clean and very modern. Staff where very friendly and polite. Housekeeping needs to be rethought out and a better quality of service provided. Breakfast needs to represented for all faiths and races and hot foods need to be hot.

Date of stay: June 2016,BenTan21,Much To Be Done To Maximize Potential,"The property is located within a good location, with a 5-10 min walk to Lavender MRT and walking distance to Arab St, Bugis and Little India. Right outside the property, there are souvenir shops and several F&B options like JolliBean, Cheers and a food court.

The hotel lobby was huge with plenty of seating areas and the elevators are ambient and nice.

Rooms are nicely done up, clean with all amenities in good condition but I had a little difficulty adapting to the very small space. Bathroom is clean but small, with no bathmat and also does not have a bidet.

Sound proofing is terrible and you can hear the corridor and from outside the balcony. I saw a group of youngsters staying up in the balcony, didn‚Äôt spoil their fun but I had difficulty sleeping as I could hear them talking and laughing throughout the night.

In the event that you encounter your tv 'hanging', allow the system to reset by removing the key card from the wall for few minutes.

It baffles me that there is limited or no mobile coverage in the rooms and the front desk explained that this is due to the hotel being too huge with 1500 rooms. Well, that's one way to think.

Service was pretty basic and gets the job done, but it was definitely lacklustre. Higher levels of hospitality would have been good. Plenty of staff, but only few were capable of service.

The hotel offers breakfast on two levels with level 4 serving halal breakfast

Breakfast was a terrible experience as restaurant was not able to detect our breakfast eligibility, resulting in me having to go back up to my room to retrieve all my cards and going to front desk to get the cards checked.

Finally upon admission into the restaurant, we had no seats and had to wait around for one like in food courts during lunch times.

Restaurant was disorderly, although it would be fair to attribute this to the limited space and the patrons themselves. People were loud and inconsiderate. I would say it was my worse breakfast ever.

I would like to commend the manager at Jubilicious for being patient and accommodating when I was not on my best, and the few front desk staff/manager that knows what service really is all about.

Date of stay: May 2016,GopiramR,Good Hotel - Bad Service,"We stayed in Hotel Boss during Mid-May. Family of 4 adults, 1 child ‚Äì two rooms.

Pros:
1) Economical rates. Very clean rooms and bathrooms.
2) Nice pool area ‚Äì unfortunately, we could not use the pool due to time constraints.
3) Access to public transport ‚Äì the Lavender MRT is about 350 metres away from the hotel.
4) Excellent food court (Foodclique) and convenience store (Cheers) in the same building as the hotel. Additionally, there are other food outlets (McD, Burger King, Kopitiam and lots more) next to the Lavender MRT station.
5) Close to other ethnic enclaves like Little India, Arab Street. If shopping is on your agenda, the Bugis Junction mall is also closeby.

Cons:
1) Paper thin walls - commotion from the next room filters into your room. We had a little bit of difficulty with loud guests the first night. But, subsequent nights were OK.

2) The hotel really needs to improve the standard of service. Three incidents which highlighted lapses:

a. During the check-in one of the hotel staff waves me over to his desk. Once I get to his desk, he proceeds to do some other transaction on his system while I am kept waiting. Finally, his colleague spots me and informs me that it will take time and I could move to a different desk.

b. In the morning, we had a mug of coffee before leaving. On coming back in the night, the coffee mugs have not been replaced. How do I know ‚Äì the mug still carries the lipstick my wife was wearing. I request for fresh mugs which come almost an hour after we place our request. The room service staff does not take back the old mugs as he seemed confused when we handed back the old ones. So now we have two used and two unused mugs in the room. We used the fresh mugs the next day morning. But again in the evening, the four used mugs were not replaced. Finally, I had to go down to the front desk where the manager ensured that a fresh set of mugs were sent to our room.

c. My wife lost a silver bracelet in the hotel premises. We reported the same to the front desk. In the evening we were told that the bracelet has been found and the staff brought out a black bead bracelet. Ultimately, the lost and found desk was not able to find the bracelet. But, the lapse in bringing out the black bracelet when we had reported the loss of the silver bracelet is what surprised us.

Final Verdict:
Hotel Boss has a lot of pros, but it is the lackadaisical service that lessens the experience. If they can bring up the quality and reliability of the service then this would turn out to be a wonderful budget option.",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Bengaluru, India",36 ,13 ,3.0,

It was my first time staying in a e star hotel so i was expecting the worst, but when i reached hotel boss, it was not that bad. It is actually a big hotel with a very nice pool, but the rooms are just so small! There isn't a space to move there anymore especially in the toilet. But it was clean though more than you can expect from a 3 star hotel, so it is a plus. My window view though, couldn't complain as i can see the singapore flyer from my room and it was amazing during the night and i had a pool view as well. Hotel is near bugis about a 5-10 min walk so easy access to shopping and dining, accessible to their mrt as well so you can get around the city with ease.

The Lavender metro station is less than 100metres away. The Arab street , Haji Lane area is across the street . So plenty of dining options. If you fancy local food there is a food court below as well as a 7/11 type store for 1$ water bottles . A taxi in peak hour to the CBD will cost you 10-12 Sing$. Walk and take the metro at $1.90 for 3 stations or less - cheaper and healthier option but you need to be fit to walk a lot ! Folks who dont walk complain of the heat , elderly - please ensure you have a budget for the cabs - its a small country . So 4 people in a cab to say Jurong Bird Park will be 20$ SGD (5 bucks a head and will save lots of time!) The hotel has a pool on the 4th level very nice. They have over 1000+rooms . Don't expect service just a really nice place to stay at a budget. 4-5 nights is a must if you need to see everything and soak it in.  there are no wardrobes or places to keep your clothes so they will remain in your suitcase !

The real shocker though was when I called in for a iron and was told to go to the 6th floor where they have facilities to iron.

Singapore is a very easy city to get around and it surely helps to have a MRT few steps away, a bus stop bang outside and Arab street/Haji lane/Bugis market/Mustafa centre within walking distance.
Yes, the breakfast options are the same everyday, however it doesn't matter as much since it is a pretty good spread afterall. The only thing I really wanted was a small clock in the room to keep a watch on the time. 6 elevators ensure that you never have to wait to go up to your room. Also, right outside is a food court which I found to be better and cleaner than some of the hawker centres I visited.

As we stay, the advantages just piled up. There is a food court at the ground floor of the hotel where lunch could be as low as 2.50sgd. In Lavander MRT there is a Kopitiam (or something similar) also for more choices. McDonald's, Burger King, and other choices were nearby as well. Right across the street is a grocery for our drinking water. If we do not want to walk and do not mind spending a few more centavos, there is also Cheers right next to the food court. founders Ba Khu Teh is also at the ground floor.

We were all over the place and being a family of ten with young children as well as old grandma and grandpa, we take a lot of time going from place to place. So to go to Chinatown for souvenir is quite a stretch from our hectic trip. They have a 3 for 10sgd souvenir shop at the ground floor as well.

Room was clean but a tight fit. Walls are very thin and lots of noise from the hallways both nights. Bathroom was modern and only criticism would be having to reach up and behind your head for toilet paper. Sound from higher floors toilets and drains was also very loud.

Breakfast option seemed OK for S$12 each but was a bad experience. Little western choice and had ran out of most things. Settled on toast only.

Con: 1) space , especially the bathroom ,think of these portal toilet cubicle ; 2) sound proof not good enough can clearly hear people talking in the hallway ,especially in the morning which may affect your sleep

Bottom line : hotel serves as its design and 3.5 star rating , good for single traveller with short stay 1-3 nights. Service is attentive, staffs are professional ,I didn't have issues at all.

Date of stay: April 2016,Cyrus Chan,Disappointing overall,"I checked the comments on TripAdvisor before booking this hotel.

Well, I haven't written a review for quite a long time but I feel I need to write again this time.

I would like to confirm that this hotel is (1) really so small (2) really lacking of services (3) really not very tidy (4) Internet speed not reasonably fast enough and (5) bad in sound-proof.

I booked ""Superior Double Room, Balcony"". My room number was 7-79.

The room is so small that you can hardly walk if there are two persons. The balcony is quite big though but useless because this type of room faces ""raiserockhole"", so no view at all.

The house keeping service is not professional. They didn't really clean the floor of my room and the small dirt (I made it) was still there after I returned to my room.

My bed sheet had some stain on it.

Given that it is a well developed and modern city Singapore, the Internet speed of this hotel is considerably slow.

The door is thin so if someone speaks outside your door or at the corridor, it's virtually like they are speaking insider your room.

Other stuff:

No one took care of the swimming pool. Many towels left unattended there.

The temperature of the shower was not stable. It kept changing during the course of my showering!

The only good things about this hotel may be the location, the grand lobby and perhaps the price.

So, take your own risk!

The room is tiny. There is no where to even put your suitcases. There isn't even a wardrobe. The bed is average. The air conditioning sounds like a tractor it is so loud and makes so much noise you will struggle to sleep.

The breakfast was a horrific experience. The staff are rude, poorly trained and have no customer service skills at all. They are more concerned with kicking everyone out at 10.30am then to provide an acceptable service. The breakfast room feels more like a cheap hostel. To gives examples of how bad this is - there is no fruit juice, one communial butter bowel for the whole room (disgusting), no pork (halal is unacceptable to western guests), no proper selection of fresh fruit and signs up about charging guests for wastage. The staff will then proceed to remind you breakfast is over and will clean your table even though you're still eating. The hot food that is available is not nice at all.

The highlight of our stay was leaving the hotel to visit the various parts of the city. Hotel is close to Bugis station which has 2 mrt lines.

The rooms are incredibly small - there is no wardrobe or even a place to store luggage. We referred to it as the box as it really feels that way and is not a nice place to stay except to sleep, and that's if you can get to your room. The lifts are unreliable, on 4 occasions over a 24 hour period we were unable to either reach our floor or reach reception, and using the stairs isn't an option as the fire doors are kept locked. The safe is also small not fitting larger items such as a camera.

There are no ""do not disturb signs"" however the maid only came in and provided new bottles of water and coffee. The bed sheets and towels weren't changed, nor were the mugs.

We visited the restaurant on the ground floor which was possibly the worst part of the hotel. One of the meals was served with uncooked chicken and without the right sauce, yet we still had to pay for this and the 10% service charge, which considering we had to get up to ask for everything such as salt and pepper there wasn't much of a service!

No room to put bathroom products either. Room service consisted of bottles of water being replaced only. Beds not made and no clean cups given. There is a restaurant  on the ground floor which  also provides the in room menu/service. When dining in the restaurant they said you couldn't charge to your room as they are not part of the hotel. Service was very poor had to collect our own menus and salt and pepper. Never checked how the meals were. On one of the meals the chicken was not cooked fully and instead of having a mushroom sauce as advertised it had mustard on top which I don't not like. On ordering a salad to have instead (as this should be edible!) the waiter still never asked if there was a problem with the meal. When asking for the bill there was a service charge which we asked to be removed but they said they couldn't even though very little service was provided.

The bathrooms had no water separation from the toilet/ washroom and often water spilled into the rooms.
The room service was poor to average. We had stumbled upon a group of employees who were quite new on the job and hence unhelpful in many matters. The concierge fared better in regards to helping and dishing out important tips.
The room had fast Wifi and the TV channels quite interesting. The view on Victoria street was glorious.
The restaurant had poor vegetarian meal choices and the answer we got for a change of meal was that the items are set and no alterations were possible! The restaurant is not so spacious and diners have to rub shoulders more often than not. The swimming pool is good.

The room itself was clean and tastefully furnished. It has complimentary bottled water and a full set of toiletries. The bed was comfortable too. The wifi in the room was fast and the best part, you can access the internet and even youtube easily on the television. Honestly, this is the first hotel that i've stayed in that i did not find any flaws with. Absolutely love it.

Tip: dont forget to tap your room card before you press the lift button or else the lift will not ascend ( i observed that not many people knew this)",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,,51 ,17 ,,5.0
Date of stay: April 2016,Prasanna Vee,Value for Money accommodation close to Arab Quarter,"Posh hotel in a good location that comes with all the fittings you would expect in a good 4 star property. However the rooms are quite small ,but that is what you can expect for a price like this in Singapore, so its acceptable. The views from teh room are wonderful. Do make sure you get a room facing Kampong glam/Arab Quarter. The only downside is , this seems to be one of those hotels that get promoted heavily for tourist groups - esp. from China. I am not being discriminatory here, but this always brings in boat loads of tourists who constantly crowd the lobby area which can be extremely overwhelming

LOCATION: The property is located stone;s throw away from the Arab quarter - where you can find great options for food, drink as well as shopping very funky & unique stuff from local and foreign artists/artisans.

FITNESS FACILITIES: LImited GYM that has treadmills, elliptical and similar machines. NO Free weights. A single machine that can be used to work out Chest/Biceps/Tripceps is provided which is ok for a quick workout. Machines seemed to be imported from China. The highlight is the Wonderful Swimming Pool - A lap pool that is a dream to swim in, with lovely views of the high rises all around and pefect for a early morning or late evening workout.

SERVICE : Very Patient staff who politely manage the overwhelming volume that seems to crowd this place all the time. Got upgraded to a 3 PAX suite upon requesting for a room with a good view - for free! Thanks to BAO (i think that was his name!)

HOW WIRED YOU WOULD BE: FREE Wifi that worked all around the property. High speed and will enable you to do both Personal and official work done smoothly. Good Set of TV channesl including free movie channesl",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Copenhagen Region, Denmark",5252 ,567 ,,3.0

Date of stay: April 2016,melitajane,Nothing like the internet,"My husband, 1yo toddler and I stayed for 6 nights and were counting down until we left from the minute we stepped foot in the place. Service at all levels is very poor, at times to be honest it felt like a race thing, being of white Australian background most people looked down at you and weren't prepared to help. But we found this across Singapore in general.
The room is the size of a shoe box and when we queried if we were in the right room we were informed there is no difference in the size of a standard or superior double, so don't bother paying the extra if space is what you're after.
The buffet breakfast you wouldn't serve to your dog, not much variety and it's so crowded you feel like you're amongst pigs at a trough.
There is absolutely no pattern to the daily room service, one day you get only your complimentary bottles of water replaced, the next your towels are changed, we had to request our sheets be changed and take out our own rubbish most days. We saw rooms being swept out around us but not once was ours.
For such a large hotel there is only one tour desk operator so you won't get much help/direction in regards to attractions or transport here. You're best going to the tourist hub at Suntec City as a base point for any tours etc. (less then 2kms down the road or a $6 taxi ride)

The rooms are all is great condition, beds and sheets lovely and clean, well equipped with hair drier and kettle. Bathroom tiny but all you need.  We booked a family room and we read the reviews and new the rooms were tiny.  Booking.com lists family rooms as 32 SQM this is a mistake.  All family rooms at HOTEL Boss are 19sqm ...and they take no responsibility for what booking.com says.  The room has two queen sized beds and there is no room for anything else.  Our suitcases are on the balcony outside and only one person at a time can move around the room...the others have to stay on the beds or sit on balcony....I might add strangled the balcony is massive.  All family rooms face inwards so no view at all.Breakfast is terrible.  I witnessed people going thought the bread with this bare hands to find a suitable piece, sneezing on uncovered food on the buffet. The butter, jam and peanut butter are in large communal bowls, so people using same knife for butter and jam or peanut butter...it's YUK. The limited fruit on offer is not fresh.    We cancelled the included breakfast for the rest of our stay and were told that the first floor  restaurant is actually outsourced and not the responsibility of Hotel Boss.  Kindly though they did refund the breakfast charge.    The pool area is nice but for such a large hotel 16 sun beds just isn't enough. Also, many people just walk off and leave used towel on sunbed so you never know where they are coming back or not. The hotel is ok and for the price I would stay here again ....without breakfast.

Date of stay: April 2016,Saurabh J,Nice property!!!,"I stayed in this property for 6 Nights. First the good things. I liked the hotel as it is very conveniently located near the Lavender MRT station and also 10 min walking distance to Little India and Mustafa Mall. A boon for any Indian who would want to have Indian food. My check-in was quick and I was offered an early check-in since I reached Hotel at 11am. I had requested for a city view room with a balcony on the highest floor. Would like to thank Zahara and Philomena at the front office for the same also they were greeting all the guest with a good smile, one of the most important thing in the hospitality sector. Well I was allotted the Room on the 18th Floor 1857. The room had a good view of the skyline of Singapore. The balcony was also overlooking the swimming pool. As regards to swimming pool I would say it was one the best among the one`s with the Hotels with whom I have stayed during my earlier visit to Singapore. The room was absolutely clean. Since the hotel is new everything was very clean. The hotel also has a kids play area so if you have small kids they would have good fun. One more unique feature was the television, they have an android TV connected to internet so you can surf internet on the TV also you can play your favorite youtube videos on TV. I was also provided complimentary late check-out till 1PM. Thanks once again to the front office team. The wi-fi connectivity in the hotel as well as the room is superb with great speed.

Well now come to some other aspects of the Hotel. As pointed in other reviews, Yes the rooms and bathrooms are quite compact considering the scale of the Hotel. Since I was a solo traveler hence a double bed room was just fine but I doubt if it had 2 person staying the double room would not have space to put the luggage and move around. But I know now nothing can be done on the room and bathroom size. They also do not have wardrobe and just have 4 hangers mounted on the wall to hang clothes. Managing your clothes could be a real challenge if you are staying for longer nights. The problem which I experienced during my 6 nights stay. Also the bathroom amenities are too basic. Would love if they could improve on that. No bathroom slippers, I think they should provide one. Didn`t try the food at hotel as for food I always headed to Little India.

Overall it was a good stay experience and I would keep coming back to this Hotel because of its location, swimming pool and cleanliness.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Indore, India",65 ,18 ,,4.0

There are hot eating spots nearby so you definitely can't go hungry. Even when hunger pangs strikes at night there is a 24 hour convenience store at level one.

My room is situated at level 16, was small but cosy. The view overlooking north bridge road area is refreshing actually. My only gripe is the shower head which can't be fixed nicely on the housing in order to shower hands-free.

Walked around the pool area @ level 4, looks good. Wish I had spent more time to try that out.

To be fair my grandson enjoyed the playground and swimming pool, breakfast left a lot to be desired so don't bother taking the breakfast package - loads of eating options 5 minutes walk.

Date of stay: April 2016,DGandGG,Good for a One Night Stay,"We stayed for 5 nights, we arrived late, about 2300. Check in was ok but once we were in the room we found it to be very small so we were glad we booked one with a balcony. It gave some extra room to store our bags. The room was very clean with basic amenities in the one person bathroom. The room had a good TV but limited viewing and the free internet was excellent. But, on the first night that's about where it ended, the noise from other guests was intolerable. Luckily we were able to sleep in and went to breakfast around 0930. It was a basic affair and crowded around the serving area, notwithstanding the breakfast room was only around 25% occupied. Most of the hot food was tepid, the bulk butter dish was empty as was the communal jam bowl. The remaining choice was peanut butter. Needless to say we had breakfast elsewhere afterwards. To this end there are plenty of alternatives in the vicinity of the hotel especially near the Lavender MRT.
Over our five days sheets and towels were changed daily which was unexpected, however, bathroom cleaning deteriorated over the days, hand basin, shelving and toilet were not cleaned, empty shower gel tubes were not removed and soap not replaced.
This we consider is not the fault of the housekeeping but more of management and training. The housekeeping staff were lovely to talk to, but it would appear that hotel policy only allows a thorough room clean on the change of guest.
Back to reception staff they were approachable, polite and helpful.
The hotel itself is a bit remote from tourist areas but it is close to the MRT and bus system and Singapore must have the best public transport system on the planet.

Date of stay: March 2016,Meteorii,Decent Budget Hotel,"Staying here for two weeks, from late March to mid April 2016. Matter of fact, I've just arrived home yesterday.
The hotel are placed in a very strategic location.
Bus stop are directly at the front of the hotel, and the buses stopping at this stop are going to most places around SG, and few minutes walk will get you to the Lavender MRT station. The closest mall to proximity are Bugis Juction and Bugis+ malls.

There are food court on the back side of the hotel, mostly offers Chinese foods, but there are also Japanese, Western and Malay foods available. The food court is air conditioned as well.

The lobby are very large, people would mistaken this hotel as a five star hotels from the look of it.
There are more than 3 people who will help you on the front desk and they are always busy! Some of them does not speak English though, and I find it weird.

Also, I've tried to test their knowledge, and they are not very helpful when it comes to directions to touristy places, or bus routes to get there, they can only know to give you maps and expect the guests to be magically understood which way to go with it. I find it weird since I assume the people working at front desk are locales but yet don't know much how to get around their own country?

One time, one guy at front desk helped by printing out directions to Jurong bird Park, and after I tried it for a test, but all the information in there are not valid, only wrong routes and I've tried to get the Bus Interchange appointed in the directions, and turns out the bus that supposed to go to Bird park didn't even stopped there!

Lucky I am not first timer, but imagine if I am, I would wasting so much time on the road just to find out I was taking the wrong route!

The room amnesties are average, you'll get the basics such as soap bar, shampoo, shower gel, shower cap, sanitary bag, and tooth brush set. Aside of that there's electric kettle and two cups for guests to enjoy their hot beverage. Bottled water are replenished daily. So does the instant coffee, tea, creamer, and sugar.

I had funny experience though regarding this matter,
somehow they always missed to replace the coffee and creamer for my room in first few days of staying, and I had to rang the front desk each time, maybe the people who's in charge for this job needed to get more training?

There's swimming pool on the 4th floor, it is only 1.5 meters deep so it is safe for adult who can't swim but like to have a dip, but a younger kids may need supervision as there are no guard available.

The towels are available for free, but please remember to put it into the towel bins after use, I find it annoying some guests just let their used towels on chairs after they finish swimming!

Speaking of chairs, there are not enough chairs for all of us, sometimes all chairs are fully occupied, especially in busy hours, so some guests had to put their belongings on the floor, and there are still so many space for it, maybe the hotel management may want to add some more chairs so it will be far more convenient.

There are also playground for kids, a restaurant, and tiny fitness room in the same floor.

The hotel also have laundromat on the 11th floor, which I find very convenient. Inside there are 2 washing machines and 2 dryer, each will need Singaporean $5 (in form of $1 x5 coins) to use. Also available in the laundromat room are 2 iron boards, 2 clothes irons, and 2 liquid detergent container to those who do not bother to get their own detergent. And a TV so you won't get bored if you choose to wait in there than leaving it til its done in your room.

The room size are very good for its price range and there are also a window come with it, and this is not common for Singapore budget hotels. For this price range, from my personal experience, you'll likely get a room just as small but without window, no laundromat, and no swimming pool. Some rooms are also come with balcony.

The TV in the room can also play YouTube or stream internet radio in case you are not interested with the TV channels available as it is limited.

The bed are good and firm. They change the linen each day. Wish they'd give more pillow though. There are only 1 pillow on each side of the bed in my room. They could have put a pair of pillows on each side just like most hotels does.

The power output are very convenient, I have always brought adapter when travelling abroad since some countries have different plugs, but the one at Hotel boss are already versatile, no matter what kind of charger you have for your electronic device, you can use it here. I find that very useful!

There are also a mini fridge available in the room, so you can do little grocery of beverages or fruits and keep it fresh there. There's safe box and hair dryer too.

The bathroom are quite small, but enough.
The shower head could be placed a little higher as it sometimes knocked on my head since I am tall. Seems it is designed for petite posture. But the shower were pleasant, hot water streamed instantly, I never waited for the water to get hot as I usually would in hotels in South East Asia.

The wi-fi were fast, but it is not available when you are in the elevator. Only in the room, the alley way and the lobby. Since it is open wifi, I suggest to use protection when you use it, so you will have more secure connection to use for e-mails and personal browsing like that.

I was staying at 19th floor, and it was rather quiet when I was there, I had good sleep each nights. And the air conditioner are working well too, and quiet. The controller are easy to use.

One more thing I need to highlight, the check out were swift, and they'd allowed guests to drop their baggage, if they have more time, like I did, since the check out time is 11 AM, but unfortunately they didn't allow renting a room for quick shower, which I find odd, because every hotels that I have stayed in, even five stars resorts and hotels, would help me with it. Maybe the management would like to consider this because for tourists who have long haul flights, say to Europe, or North America, it is not nice to fly hours without having a shower.

All in all, this place is value for money, and if they can improve their front desk staffs service and more that I mentioned here, it will be totally worth place to stay over while in SIngapore.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"San Francisco, California",15 ,9 ,4.0,

I've tried Carlton Hotel at Bras Basah Road, Parkroyal Hotel and Park Royal Apartment in Beach Road, Ibis in Bencoolen, Royal Plaza on Scotts Road and now Hotel Boss in Lavender. The latter is quite a new hotel. I like the spacious lobby and the stunning chandelier. Location is a few steps away from Lavender station. Hotel is surrounded by some gift shops, a massage parlor, a Bakuteh restaurant, a fragrance shop, a sushi shop, a Cheers convenience store and a lovely food court named the Foodclique ( about 12 food stalls).Inside the hotel you would find 2 restaurants, ie Pappasan on the ground floor and Jubilicious on the fourth floor. Pappasan serves vegetarian food while Jubilicious serves burgers and other types of food. The hotel has a small gym on the 4th floor which is all glass and has a view of the adjacent swimming pool. The twin room which I got feels a bit cramped. Tea bags, instant coffee sachets and bottled mineral water is replenished everyday. There is a safe inside one of the drawers but there are no closets. Toiletries are provided but no cotton buds. No bathrobe, slippers nor laundry bag. Despite these limitations, the hotel is packed everyday.

The environment within and around the hotel is good and the staff at the front desk are helpful.

For the size of the hotel the restaurant was unexpectedly quiet at breakfast time and was well managed. Check again was very efficient for the size of the hotel and the fact that it is new. The location of the hotel is good with only a few minutes walk to the lavender MRT which is only 2 stops into the city centre.

No ventilation at night and it gets pretty claustrophobic. Two people cannot cross each other without rubbing against them. Everything in this hotel (rooms, gym, bathrooms) is extra small. No storage space apart from one drawer and a couple of hangers in the open... so you will have to live out of your bags.

Then yesterday, I checked into the Hotel Boss in Singapore. I really wish I had not done that!! I can honestly tell you, this was without doubt the very worst experience I have EVER had.

Now don't get me wrong, the property itself is palatable, although the write ups are not representative of reality. The room I was allocated is big enough for a person about half my size. The room was not clean (hair everywhere) and I was forced to use someone else's dirty towels!

But let's talk about the attitude of the staff....I booked through a well known website and the advice I printed out clearly stated that I could pay either on check in or on check out. Based on what I thought was my reality, I tried to check in with the plan to pay on check out.

After a VERY long day, I was advised that this is against hotel policy. When I produced my voucher to explain my position, the Duty Manager intervened. I might add that I was observing this person at the beginning - the reason he took my notice was that he was more interested in checking his hair in the reflection of the wall behind the check in counter.

That is until I started to protest my position! This is when the hair do arrived. I tried to explain the situation, indicated the clause on my voucher, only to be told that this is not the hotel policy! I suggested that he needs to sort the matter out with the web based booking agent.

At this point I was told that unless I pay all on check in, then they will not give me a room. I indicated that I had a very long day (after a serious long flight) and due to the information I had, I was unable to fulfil the wish of the Duty Manager. The response I got was a very aggressive ""I've had a long day too, and frankly I don't care about your confirmation voucher. This is our policy, and if you don't like it, then go"".

Are you kidding me??

There should be a mechanism to thwart this sort of attitude.

The bottom line? I was finally allocated a room under very strict conditions.

My recommendation? Avoid, avoid, avoid!

And if you ever see a guy in a black jacket, attending to his hair, with a name badge that reads Jason Lee, do not go near him. You might just be told that he's had a long day!! Once upon a time, the customer mattered! But not in Hotel Boss Singapore!

Date of stay: March 2016,Baiju80,4 night stay at Hotel Boss,"First of all I read a lot of good reviews on TripAdvisor about Hotel Boss and finally after comparing a lot of other options I finalized Hotel Boss for our family trip of 5 days and 4 nights at Singapore.

- Check in

Extremely good check in experience and we were allowed to check in as early as 11am when we reached the hotel from the airport. Nice and huge lounge and ever helping staff at the numerous check-in counters. We even got a free upgrade coz they had this promotion if we 'liked' the hotel's Facebook page and booked the rooms via the Hotel website. The interesting part was this promotion ended in February but the staff were courteous enough to still give us the promotion even after the expiry date. So i got my 'Superior double room' upgraded to 'Superior double room with balcony' free of charge! Kudos to the staff.

- Room

The room size is small as you might have read from many reviews here. Considering the price you are paying for the stay it is still okay. However one main issue is the non-availability of built in wardrobes so it is bit of a trouble if you are staying for 3-4-5 days as the big luggage has to be kept on the floor and not enough hanger options too. There is a 40 inch SMART LED TV in the room which is pretty good. TV channel options are very limited. Free complimentary wi-fi is available in the rooms and it was working fine with good speed. Hair drier and safe deposit box are also available in the room along with the tea / coffee options and water.

- Locality

The best thing about this hotel is its locality. Very close to Lavender MRT station and bus stops. Also lot of cheap and good eating options available around the hotel. Walking distance of about 10 min to the Little India and the famous Mustafa shopping center.

- Pool and Gym

The hotel has a superb pool in the 4th floor. It is very spacious and it is very well decorated along the boundary walls with excellent garden. There are outside seating options too besides the pool. The gym is right next to the pool and although pretty small it does have nice new treadmills and some other fitness equipment inside.

- Check out

Check out was also very quick. Although the standard check out time is 12pm we were allowed to check out at 1.15pm without any extra cost. When we told the reception about the check-out they immediately sent the person to our room to tak our baggage downstairs and subsequently to the taxi area of the hotel.

Breakfast is basic, and you can't always book breakfast with your room. We found that we could only book b&b for 2 days of our stay, the other we could only book the room. The breakfast areas are small given the number of rooms in the hotel. But since numbers allowed breakfast is controlled there is no problem once you are in the breakfast area.

This happened several times during my stay. The staff are also not friendly. I actually wouldn't stay again simply because this was so annoying. It is a shame because I travel to Singapore a lot. Not very helpful when you do manage to get their attention. It's a disturbing team culture for such a new business style hotel.

Room was good, although AC fan speed not controllable, only temperature - fan speed is incorrectly auto-governed by the temperature setting. Near my room was a staff overnight room where the door was wedged open regularly and the stench emanating from staff smoking inside that room left the hallways reeking of smoke.

Pool level is good. The pool deck would be exceptional if it had a bar.

The overall experience was great, from the intial check-in where we were met by Mr William to check-out on Monday 6th March.

Yes the rooms are small but everything you need for a stay is available; clean, comfortable bed, efficient shower/toilt area, tea and coffee making facilities and complementary bottled water. We found the TV and WiFi to work well and my wife have developed an interest in Chinese movies!

The skydeck with pool is also very nice.

Regarding some of the comments about the rooms being small, this is true but if you are only using it to sleep then there is no problem. We were in Singapore for nearly three weeks and were able to unpack all our clothing and hang it in the space provided. A tip for travellers is to bring some extra hangers and all clothes can be accommodated in the hanging space.

Our first room was 608 which had a view of Victoria Street and the second time I requested an upgrade which was room 1354. This room was a triple with city views. This represented great value at $246 Sing. dollars.

Food was available in the Food Court adjacent to the hotel and we have becomegreat fans of the Breakfast Set (two soft boiled eggs with kaya toast and tea or coffee) which was only $3.50 per person. There are also a couple of nice bars around the back of the hotel.

Access to the MRT was very easy, only being 5 minutes walk away at Lavendar station and Arab Street was just over the road with Hadji Lane and Bali Street offered great bars.

Date of stay: March 2016,arielgetz,Functional and modern,"Stayed in a family suite with balcony on the 8th floor on Saturday as there was a promotional rate.

Checked in at 2.30pm as the room was not ready when we arrived at 1.50pm. Lobby and lifts were impressive although the design of the lift numbers panel was not very well done. While the individual numbers panel was lighted up, the numbers are not thus making it difficult to see the level you would like to go. Wifi is free and is strong. The WIFI password for the rooms and the lobby are different.

Room was very TINY for a family room but the balcony was rather spacious with a rattan table and two chairs available. Bed was comfortable although the pillows were too soft. Bathroom was also tiny although it was very clean. As it was a family suite meant for four, the basic toiletries e.g shower gel, shampoo and dental kit, were also provided for four. The immediate impact was one of a shoebox apartment where all the basic necessities you required are there but without the space. We didn't manage to get a room with a view and had to contend with facing the balconies and rooms of other guests. Do remember to draw the curtains as everything is visible once your light is switched on.

There was no cupboard or wardrobe but functional hooks embedded along the walls which I thought was clever. A small fridge was available along with the complimentary tea and coffee.

Pool and gym were on the 4th floor along with a small playground for children. This level was extremely spacious with lots of greenery which was a bit waste of space though I have to say that it makes for a relaxing ambience. Jubilicous the restaurant was also located on this floor. My two children had a pretty good time running around on this level and jumping into the pool

Location is convenient as there is a bus stop right outside the hotel and the Lavender MRT is a 5 mins walk away. Easy to find food as there is a 24 hours food court and convenience store right next to the hotel. There is more food options at the Lavender MRT and a supermarket nearby.

Will I come back for a staycation? Probably not as the space is really small.
Will I recommend to tourists? Yes because it is situated at a convenient location, and provide your basic needs e.g sleep and a place to put luggage, in a modern setting.

For some unknown reason online credit card bookings could not be made so had to pay upon arrival.

The lobby entrance is impressive however unfortunately it was all downhill from there. I had to ask where the lifts were, where breakfast was served and what time checkout was, all standard things all other hotels would always communicate about when checking in.

The room was undoubtably the tiniest room I have ever stayed in. It was very cramped and uncomfortable. No face cloths are provided, no iron or ironing board in the room having instead to go down four floors to a shared laundry room. The toilet paper towel dispenser was ever so awkwardly on the wall above and behind the toilet making for a contortionist type manoeuvre to take the paper which incidentally only dispenses one sheet at a time!

There is no wardrobe, the bed is one of the hardest I have ever had to try and endure sleeping on and the walls are not soundproofed ensuring I could hear the people in the room above every trip to the toilet and showering as well as people walking past the room outside the door.

The lifts are quite slow, the wifi in the breakfast restaurant continuously kept losing connectivity and there was a curious notice on the wall stating $5 would be charged for every 100g of leftover food not eaten! There is no option of eggs being made to your liking and on the first morning of my stay the staff forgot to switch on the coffee machines.

The rooms were clean very simple, good water pressure, bed not very comfortable. The staff at front desk were friendly but not memorable!

Date of stay: February 2016,dias62,"Small rooms, but value for money","Stayed at this hotel last week with my family for three nights. This is a brand new hotel situated near the Lavender MRT station which is on the same MRT line that goes to Changi airport. Hence you can take the train from and to the airport at S$2.40 per person, one way whereas a taxi ride will cost you around S$25/-. Location is good as a 10 minute walk will get you to Bugis area or to Little India, both are popular for shopping and food.

The hotel have more than 1000 rooms and as a result the lobby area which is quite nice can be very crowded sometimes. The front office staff is friendly and helpful. They charge you the full amount at the time of check in and hence the check out is very quick as you just have to hand over the key cards.

The triple room we got was small but had a double bed and a proper single bed. It had all the required facilities like Mini fridge (No Bar), tea/coffee, water, LED TV with internet, safe, Free WiFi etc. Only thing you can complain about the room is that it lacked closet space and luggage rack. The lack of closet space can be a problem if you are staying for a longer time. The bathroom is also very very small but had all what is needed including complimentary toothbrushes. The toilet seat is crammed in between the shower and the wash basin and as a result a big made person might have some problems using it.

As the tripadvisor reviews were not recommending the breakfast we opted for bed only and hence cannot comment on the food. But there is a food court on the ground floor of the hotel where you can get good food at cheap prices. Anyway food is never a problem in Singapore as almost everywhere you will find restaurants and food courts.

Also they have very nice and an inviting swimming pool on the 4th. floor, and a small gym along with the restaurant where they normally serve the morning breakfast.

Came across hotel boss at the last minute and found some good prices online. It is new hotel opened 2015.
With four children 2 teens and 2 under 4 we used a family room which has 2 double beds. The teens share, we have a child with us in our bed and we use a travel cot. It works for us as we are used to traveling together in even smaller rooms. But saves needing to pay for two rooms.
Staff are friendly.
Room:
clean, good bathroom, ( tip - lock door to balcony with young children to avoid them getting out and playing on furniture )
Water is replaced daily and I thought the wifi was great was able to do anything I needed, teen daughters are harder to please with wifi but trust me it works just fine, if you can snap chat and face time friends at home it should meet all needsüòä
Dining :
can't comment on dining as we never ate at the restaurant but just out of doors from reception is a 24hr food hall with a variety of Asian options. (Just to advise there are less food stalls open 3:30am in morning than at lunch. ( when We first arrived due to time difference I would walk around with babies who were still getting up local time AEST) and of course grab some noodles and rolls.
Transport :
easy from this location (due to work I arrived in Singapore earlier than family and in the few trips in a taxi to the airport it cost me under $20 dollars per trip. But this could also be luck as was not a lot of traffic.
MRT( lavender train station is 300 meters up the road, level easy walk and from there you can go anywhere pretty much ) as a side note with 6 in the family while we used the MRT to get around we normally used it one way to travel to the areas we wanted to explore and then when the babies were screaming or the parents had had enough we would cab back. ( don't take this as gospel but it would be approx 6:60 - 10SGD for a train one way or about 8 - 14SGD for a taxi. Even 20SGD at the end of a long day is worth it for all of us )

This hotel is huge with 1500 tiny rooms, catering mostly (from what I saw) to large groups and school trips. Large very noisy lobby.
Check-in and front desk: Extremely chaotic. The front desk is staffed with several employees (up to 10-12) at a time. Guests wait in random order - there is no line! As soon as a position becomes available, it's a mad sprint with survival of the fittest. Incomprehensible why the hotel doesn't set up a proper line.
Rooms: Very very small (not unexpected in Singapore). Clean. Comfortable bed and pillows. Room amenities include coffee maker and laptop-size safe. Air conditioning difficult to adjust: there is a thermostat, but the fan cannot be adjusted.
Bathroom: Very very small, to the point that the toilet paper holder is above your head when you sit on the toilet. Low water pressure in sink and shower. Only bath towels provided (no hand towels). No trash can in the bathroom. No toilet paper rolls provided, only individual paper sheets.
Noise level: No soundproofing and plenty of noise from the hallways from other guests and housekeeping (the latter starting well before 08:00). Also, you can hear the toilet flushing or the water running from the room above you as if it were in your own room.
Mediocre housekeeping (coffee and soap bar not replaced).
No ""Do not disturb"" sign provided. A light on the outside indicates whether the guest is in the room (actually whether the key card is inserted in the slot), which is not the best for safety.

I stayed there twice during our trip in SE Asia.
Rooms are very very small, but well equipped with all you can need for a basic stay.

Maybe housekeeping should be improved. Due to the huge number of rooms, the housekeepers seemed to be overwhelmed and cleaning is made superficially.

Breakfast at first level floor is a disaster. Very few selection of food and the restaurant is a complete chaos, only 2 members in staff to clean tables after hundreds of people. When we returned to the hotel we didn't choose breakfast anymore.

There is no sound proofing in the walls and the hallways and there are at least 40 rooms to every floors.

Date of stay: February 2016,Megan C,Great Brand New Hotel,"Stayed here with my sister from Jan 30- Feb 1. It's a new hotel so everything was brand new which was great.

Some issues we had was we requested an early check in but when we got there at 10:40am they informed us that we had to go back at 2pm since there are no rooms available. We just left our bags at the baggage counter and came back at 2pm. Baggage counter is great btw, we had a 7pm flight back so we just left our bags when we checked out and came back for them at around 5pm. It's free and there are alot of space allocated for your bags.

On the second day our keycard randomly stopped working. And we just knew about it when we were at our door. Our room was on the 19th flr and we just came back after a whole day of walking so yeah I wasn't really happy that we had to go back down to the front desk lol.

The room is really small but it wasn't an issue for us since we were out most of the day. And the high ceilings make up for it so even tho it was small i didn't feel suffocated at all. There is no cabinet but there are hooks where you can hang your clothes. There's a mini-fridge, electric kettle, hair-dryer, complimentary water, tea, and coffee.

Wi-fi is powered per room by the tv, so it means you'll only get wi-fi if your tv is on. They also have the general wi-fi but it has a limit of only 12 hours, unlike the room wi-fi which is unlimited. Wi-fi was okay but could be improved. There were times during the night that the internet would not work.

Hot and cold shower was working great. But there's no trash can there so I had to move the trash can from the room to inside the bathroom. And even tho there's a glass door between the shower and the sink area, floor still becomes flooded because of the shower.

There's also a House of Chocolates store outside the hotel if you need to do some last minute shopping. And if ever you need anything, there's a convenience store outside, a money changer, as well as a few restaurants and their 24 hour foodcourt.

I highly recommend trying the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at the foodcourt. It's the same hawker stall at Maxwell Food Centre that Gourdon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain talked about. While the stall at Maxwell has uber long lines, the stall here at Hotel Boss has no lines at all, probably because they just opened.

Location is great. Taxi from Changi airport costs around $11. The hotel is also a 10 min walk away from Bugis St. and Haji Lane. It's also in front of a bus stop and a block away from an MRT station.

The laundry room is at the 11th floor. Wash is $5 and dry is also $5. Wasn't able to try their pool and buffet.

- Inside decoration quality, materials, work etc is rather poor. Some small defects were already described in other reviews. But considering its new - feels OK.
- Swimming pool is fantastic. Its actually the whole open air level 4 with some extra sitting places etc.
- Staff and service is a bit messy indeed. I guess in few months they should get into the flow and improve.
- Breakfast is offered in Asian and Western versions in two different restaurants. Quality is average at best, but ok for a 3* pricing.
- Rooms are quite small. Trouble is - there is no cabinet. So if your trip is over 2 days, you are doomed to have messy suitcase.
- Location is good as mentioned. Close to everything.
- Need an iron? Take your staff to ironing room and help yourself :)

2) Bed is a bit hard
3) The shower area is really small, Its ok for small size like me but i think it will be quite difficult for a burly man to take shower and open the glass door.
4) Thin wall. We can hear people talking at the corridor and close door easily.
5) Basic amenities like tooth brush+ tooth paste, shower cap, sanitary bag, shampoo and shower gel are provided. Will suggest hotel to provide disposable slipper because i found the floor is a bit sticky.

Overall it's still worth to stay as the price is reasonable and location is really great.

Date of stay: January 2016,Jim K,Average hotel with great access,"First off, the location was very good, we came to Singapore from Malaysia and arrived at the Queen street bus terminal which is a 5-10 min walk from Hotel Boss. So getting to the hotel was a breeze. We also found out quite quickly that getting from the hotel to the rest of the city was equally as easy since the Lavender MTR station is conveniently located another 5 min by foot from the hotel. The commute from Lavender to Changi airport is also easy (took us around 30 minutes), making Hotel Boss very accessible.

The room we stayed in was very small but nice and clean. Some noise from the corridors could be heard, but otherwise quite well insulated.

Hotel Boss is literally packed with rooms, but the other amenities (and staff) does not seem to be quite scaled for the amount of guests living there. Expect additional service (asking for additional bed sheets or more toilet paper) to be carried out in a matter of hours and not minutes.
The breakfast is also something that doesn't really scale well. The breakfast area at level 4 is way to small to accommodate for all guests, which is why we needed to queue for 10minute before getting seated, only to discover that the breakfast was below average.

I've gathered that the pricing is quite cheap for Singapore but did still expect a bit more value for the money. However, the standard of the room and the location makes this a good stay for a brief visit to Singapore.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",7 ,6 ,3.0,

Date of stay: January 2016,SOH YONGXIN,one-night stay.,"dear hotel boss singapore,

just let me first start off by saying that you're located in a very lovely & awesome location. not only is it centralized, it is also near to wherever i work & have my conferences at too. i was recommended by a good friend to give HB a go, considering the fact that the regular hotel that i have always went to whenever i landed happened to have no room availability that day (i checked in with y'all on the 19th Jan'16, just last night) & i thought, ""hey, it ain't going to be a bad idea, just break it out of my system & be flexible just this one time. give somewhere new a go & see how it goes!"" so i booked my room online, & headed down in less than an hour.

i really love your hotel lobby, & the entrance of the hotel lobby where our drivers would drop us. it's really spacious, i love the lightings, it's really elegant & charming. but i have got to say... to have your reception staffs not smiling & not seemingly welcoming guests is definitely not a cherry on top of the cake. check-in & registration was pretty fuss-free, though i find it VERY disturbing that my I/C & payment card went along with your staff after he got me to take a seat, & got back to me about 5-10 minutes later to confirm my check-in. (i'm not too sure if it's the right way to do it, but i was warned about credit card frauds, or anything like that which is why i find it extremely disturbing). let me wait a reasonable amount of time for all you want so you can go check on the confirmation email/notification of my room that i just reserved online, it's okay. BUT going away from the main counter to check on those with my IC & payment cards sure gets me very uneasy.

the room i booked was a superior double with a balcony. so upon entering my room, i was actually a little bit shocked, the room is a tad too tiny for a superior double for my liking. (but having said that, to be fair enough, it all comes right down to preferences) i always travel alone for conferences, & i am not one to mind paying for a spacious room & have it all to myself. but hey, i'm alone so y'know, the small room didn't exactly bother me very badly. if i were to chuck my luggage right next to the space where the door open all the way nicely, it's actually obstructing my trip in & out of both the room & bathroom. the space is really limited, & i don't think it's suitable for anyone travelling with a lot of luggages, considering the fact that i'm already having a little problem with just one luggage & a suitcase.

the room is slightly stuffy upon entering, the air-con & fan took a little while to cool - no biggie. i go right down to unpack immediately & stripping down & heading straight for the bathroom & that's when i realized... there are no bath towels at all. i searched everywhere, i touched the walls just right outside the bathroom hoping that there would be some sort of cabinets, but there isn't. NO towels, NO bedroom slippers, NO hand cloth, NO mat in/out of the bathroom to dry your feet. i called down to the receiption, asking for some assistance in regards to having no towels in the room & they got it up in 10-15 minutes or so.

aside from that little hiccup, i find the room rather cosy (though extremely constricted) & it's very clean! after my shower, i thought the sink was acting a little weird. i brushed it off & came back to the bathroom 30 minutes later, only to confirm that it's really choked. the water i used to wash my hands have not run down at all. i called up the receiption & went, ""hi, i am calling from room 1925."" to which... the lady over the line went ""what i can do for you, 1925?"" i'm just saying, that i do think that it's definitely a better idea to be addressing your guests over the line as either sir/madam, rather than the room number. it makes me sounds like an inmate, which i find it darkly amusing.

but overall, my one-night stay is quite okay. i think staying on the top floor leads to really unstable wifi & phone signal; my phone signal literally shows ""no signal"" the entire night. i got woken up at almost 9.30 in the morning by some constant knock (probably on the roof? idk, i mean, i stay on the 19th storey which is already the top floor) that didn't go away till almost 12:45 PM. well, i guess for a new hotel, there's a lot of potentials.",Trip type: Travelled solo,"Singapore, Singapore",59 ,16 ,3.0,

I am sure this was a promo price and the rate will go up soon. The lobby is beautiful and grand and the check-in very friendly fast and efficient. It seems we got upgraded without a mention to us, as we got a 16th floor city view room with views to the Singapore Eye and Gardens By The Bay. The hotel is so new everything is perfect. The rooms are small, but have everything needed. Coffee and tea making facilities, hair dryer, safe and a 40"" smart TV and nice cold air-conditioning. The bathrooms though small were very modern and clean and everything worked well. There is a wonderful 4th floor swimming pool and fitness centre with amazing views. There is a restaurant where breakfast is served behind the pool. For food options there are restaurants off the lobby and a food court in the complex or you can walk down to the Lavender MRT 5 minutes away where there is another 24 hour food court and various restaurants. I'm sure there are more but we did not explore further. Really this is a great hotel so close to everything and on the MRT line for the airport.

As local Singaporeans, we would strongly recommend this hotel as a great choice for value - for- money staycations.
It is also ideal for tourists as there is a wide choice of local cuisine available in the vicinity and it is very close to cultural and heritage sites like Little India and Arab street. Its a great place to stay in and get a glimpse of the true local culture.

The breakfast is an extra 10 spd per person, we tried it one morning but it was not so special. So we preferred to brunch in the neighbourhood. We also tried the travel desk. We booked the city tour with a very nice man who informed us well. On the day of the city tour however there was another person. As we did not see any tour guide around the agreed upon time, I went to inquire the travel desk ( we had been sitting in the lobby for 25 minutes) the man began to stress and yell at me that the bus was about to leave and how could I not recognize the driver and that they still needed to pass by 3 other hotels. I was quite shocked of his reaction as I did not see anyone searching for",,"Windhoek, Namibia",82 ,25 ,4.0,

However your Reception Staff have ben poorly trained & have an attitude problem. Last week when my wife & I checked-in, the Receptionist acted like it was a chore to serve us - e.g. not smiling, no welcome greeting & 'mechanical' in her communication. In addition a CASH payment was requested and she did not offer/provide a receipt - stating this will be provided at check-out is unprofessional of a Hotel of your standard. Other relative information regarding breakfast (not being available) and what services were also not operational was not provided.  At that time of day the Hotel was not busy - so the excuse of minimal interaction with Guest(s) is not valid. ",,"Cairns, Australia",90 ,35 ,3.0,

Date of stay: January 2016,KhairulAliffi,Reasonable price for an Amazing view!,"To start of , I was here from 31 December 2015 and the hotel just started running. It's difficult to be in the opening team, with new system running and getting the hang of it is indeed a challenge. I came from Parc sovereign at trywhitt, expected check in to be as simple and fast, and yes it was delivered. My check in agent was Ron, upon reaching the hotel, I was amazed at the lobby, it's humongous, looks grand and for the price I paid for the first night was reasonable. Knowing it was a superior room, and it's the New Year's Eve, no doubt pricing will fluctuate. Ron service was professional and efficient. Looking at the queue of check in guest, I bet it's difficult for the front desk team to handle but nonetheless it was smooth. Room was adequately furnish. What I didn't expect was the smart TV that you can actually surf the net and also YouTube application is in it. They also have informations of the hotel and ways to get around the hotel. Indeed it was sufficient. Going on to the second night so I decided to book a category higher which was the deluxe with balcony, upon reaching the front desk, I was warmly received by Kenny, he was indeed helpful looking at his uniform and quality of service I know he is of a higher position in the front desk team. I wanted a balcony high up so I can at least see the view, but unfortunately it's not available. Therefore I ask for an upgrade since it's only a night and I came down room wasn't ready, and I think the front desk team did exceptionally well to cater to my needs. I was granted the premier room on 15-100 and boy it was magnificent. Room was good, but once I reach the balcony, i was flabbergasted.  Amazing view overseeing OCBC aquatic centre, sunrises from my balcony. I was impressed. Therefore I extended the stay till today which is on the 7th.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warmest regards to those agent who help me throughout my stay, agents like Suziela who was on night shift and also Ben who help me extend my stay till now with no issues. I would gladly recommend others to take the Premier room with balcony as it is worth every penny and the pricing is reasonable. Overall it gives me the sense of belonging being away from my family on New Year's Eve. I would once again say thank you for having me here, it's a pleasure.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"England, United Kingdom",35 ,8 ,,5.0
Date of stay: December 2015,Listiyani S,Exceeding my expecation,"I was staying at the hotel during New Year Eve. In that peak season, it is hard to get a good hotel with reasonable price, but lucky I found this hotel and the rate is really competitive. It is really close to Lavender MRT station just 3 - 4 minutes walking though nice side walks.
The hotel lobby was super clean and the staff was friendly. Although there are a lot of people waiting for checking in, they were not seemed hurry but handle each guests gently instead.
The room is not super fancy but sufficient with its smart TV. Not too big but not too tiny either, the bed was comfortable. Lucky that we got city view room in the 9th floor :) Wifi connection is also strong enough.

Date of stay: January 2016,Lydia Ng,Value For Money in a Tourist District,"Small small rooms, and large open spaces in the hotel. Very new hotel and the surrounding areas were nice to explore, so we didn't spend too much time in the room. Nice touches of technology controlled temperature, door key, tv, and well thought design of safety box.
Would have been better if bedroom slippers were provided as our feet got quite dirty walking around the room. No bathroom robes provided too.

Hotel is new and everything is very clean and nice. We were staying in a room with city view, rooms are small but comfortable and cosy, there are big TV, good wi fi and very clean and nice bathroom.
The only thing we didn't like - bad soundproofed walls.

Date of stay: December 2015,lovatic92,Very Good,"My Fianc√® & I chanced upon this hotel through Agoda app. At first, we were thinking ""Hotel Boss? Never heard of it."" but then again, we decided that maybe it was a new hotel. We went to their official website and saw that it was completed in the last quarter of 2015.

We were somewhat contemplating on whether we should try it out or not but went with it anyway. We proceeded to book for our stay on the 31st December 2015 for one night.

Upon arrival, there was a really long line waiting to check-in. At least we weren't the only ones trying out the new hotel. Service was quite fast as all the counters were open. Hotel staff were polite and the frontline officers were nice too. They did not rush through things but at the same time, they completed registrations as fast as they could.

The room we booked for was a Superior double. Size was satisfactory, although it wasn't big. But there were only two of us so..it was alright. The room design was nice and gave off a comfortable vibe. The bed was superb! Maybe cause it's still new. Our view wasn't so great though as it was facing a residential block opposite but we got the 7th floor so who cares. We left the blinds down throughout anyway. There was a mini fridge which was working well. Hairdryer was provided too. Apart from that, the normal additions were included (e.g. two bottles of mineral water provided by hotel, two sachets of coffee/tea/creamer/sugar). More sugar & creamer will be good too! The toilet was clean and comes with body wash, shampoo, toothbrush & toothpaste, shower cap, sanitary bag & mini soap bar. The sink and toilet bowl were separated from the shower space by a glass door. The shower space was small and fits exactly one person. The TV in the room was good too. You could access YouTube by a simple click on the YouTube icon on the remote control. Only setback is that the TV was quite soft as it was only capped at a certain volume. But maybe it is also to avoid any disturbances to the neighbours in the other rooms. Fair enough. Free WiFi for hotel guests, too!

Location was good too. It was a 5-7minutes walk to Lavender MRT station which is where V Hotel is located too. They have a 24hour Kopitiam, Ananas Cafe, Old Chang Kee and some others down there at the MRT Station. Also, in the future, there might be a Cheers store right below Hotel Boss. The reason we didn't go there was cause it was still under construction. The hotel carpark was fine too.

The hotel rate was at an affordable price. If you're looking for a staycation just to relax & unwind, this would be the place. THEY ALSO HAVE A POOL AT THE 4TH FLOOR SO DO BRING YOUR SWIMSUITS!

Overall stay was satisfactory and would not hesitate to come back again in the future.

*Not for fussy goers/tourists as the room is not that big. Tourists might not have much space for their luggages. But then again, if you don't mind placing them near the door, why not? Or you could opt for a bigger room with the balcony. Only go if you are one who can appreciate simple and cosy hotels. If you are a smoker, consider opting for rooms with a balcony as you cannot smoke in the hotel rooms or toilets.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",1 ,18 ,4.0,
