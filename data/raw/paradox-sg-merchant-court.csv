Date of stay: November 2022,Fredphua,Extremely Upset with the Check-In Experience,"I am writing this review at 4am in the morning because I can't sleep over a very unhappy and unpleasant experience. Yes, I am still here at the hotel. What happened? Because of how your check-in staff had mishandled a queue situation (at around 2:45pm on 17 Dec). Check the CCTV and you will know what happened.

Initially there was one check-in counter (""Counter 1""). So everyone queued at Counter 1. There were 4 guests in front of me and 4 behind, I think. A man who was third in the queue (""Man"") became impatient with the long processing time and asked for a new counter to be opened. When the second counter opened (‚ÄúCounter 2‚Äù), its check-in staff gestured to the couple queuing behind the Man to the new counter. By the way, I was behind the couple. It clearly irritated the Man because he would normally be the one being moved to the new counter in such a situation given that he was next to be served at Counter 1. Moreover, he requested for a new counter but was denied reaping the benefit.

It is a common understanding and a standard operating procedure at many places for each counter to serve its own queue. So I followed the couple to Counter 2 and queued behind them with the assumption that a new queue had been intentionally created for Counter 2. The Man at Counter 1 was clearly upset because he was not asked to cross over. So he accused me of queue-cutting. I reasoned with him and the Counter 2 staff that a new queue had been created with the intention of relieving the load at Counter 1, wasn't it? It's a common operational practice. The front-desk manager whom I spoke to later in the evening concurred. I have stayed in many hotels and I know this is how it works. What really displeased and upset me was that the Counter 2 staff actually agreed with the Man to placate him. She raised her hand and gestured me to re-join the queue at Counter 1 as if I had committed a wrong. Not wanting to create a scene, I did as told. As I expected, when more guests arrived for check-in, they too queued at Counter 2 - and naturally so, right!?. Why didn‚Äôt she ask them to join the Counter 1 queue? It‚Äôs because that‚Äôs not how it works. Every counter serves its own queue, and she knows this.

The Counter 2 staff had grossly mishandled the situation and mismanaged the counter operation. She had embarrassed me in public by asking me to re-join the Counter 1 queue so to placate that unreasonable Man. It was seriously a bad judgement call. I am extremely upset with the incident. What a way to welcome a guest. And what a way to start my staycation - my first with this hotel. Guess what, it's 5:30am already.

From the welcome & checkin experience to the service and great staff in the restaurant / bar. The room was excellent, spotless and very well serviced every day. A special shout out to the Concierge, he was above excellent, even arranging a car and driver for the day to take us to Malaysia. If I had one suggestion, it would be to open the ""Blue Potato Bar"" at the swimming pool. For some reason the bar was closed and the pool area was very well frequented. It took a while for the ordered drinks to come from within the hotel, this is a bit of a lost opportunity. Overall, a fantastic stay. I will definitely stay again and the location is awesome and easy to move around the city from with a MRT station across the road.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Tauranga, New Zealand",20 ,10 ,5.0,
Date of stay: October 2022,Andrea S,Great Hotel Excellent Location,"We wanted to stay somewhere on Clarke Quay and we came across the Paradox, and we are glad we did! The location is great, so close to CQ itself and just a short walk to the CQ MRT station. We use the MRT a lot o being so close was perfect!
Check In was quite a slow process but is understandable as staffing is short worldwide, it could‚Äôve been made quicker if the self check-in was made a bit clearer, maybe sign posted. We did use the self check out when it was time to leave which was very quick and easy.
The rooms were very large especially by Singapore standards and the bathroom was large too. It was nice and clean but it would‚Äôve been good to know in advance that they don‚Äôt clean the rooms every day.
The breakfast was possibly the best buffet we‚Äôve had, there was so much choice and everything was tasty and fresh.
The pool area was nice and quiet, it was a shame the blue potato is still closed.
We would definitely stay here if we go to Singapore again.",,"Adelaide, Australia",2 ,,5.0,

,JenniG,Just OK,"If this is advertised as a 5 star hotel - it falls short. Our stay was OK, but not outstanding.

We arrived around 10:15pm following a flight from Dubai. We asked if room service would be available - we were told only until 10:30pm so reception raced through our check-in and we bolted to our room. When we got there we could not find the room service menu - then we realised it was probably on the TV menu. It was all QR code - so we had to get wifi working and then scan QR code - by this time it was 10:25pm - we rang reception number as we were told but were put on hold/disconnected. So in the end we just went outside and asked concierge where we could go - he directed us across the road to the mall. But nothing was open there apart from Burger King on outside of mall - so Burger King it was. I would have thought 24 hour room service would be standard in 5 star accommodations.

Next day at breakfast the queue to get into the dining room was extremely long - no sure what the issue was - but it took us well over 30 min wait to finally get seated - and the queue kept growing behind us. We hope that the people at the end of the queue got seated before breakfast service ended. This hotel was our last accommodation following 6 weeks in Europe - this was the 1st place we had to queue for breakfast.

Our room was on 1st floor / garden view. The room was clean and well appointed.

Pool area was nice, however pool bar was not manned/operational - not sure why. One of the days we were there some other guests were getting themselves pretty well inebriated with shots of Johnny Walker Black. There were children around the pool at this time. Now I know that guests can behave badly but no-one from the hotel was around to stop this behaviour.

Location was pretty good - first time we've been around this area. Clarke Quay looks like it needs some TLC - but walk to Chinatown, Gardens by the Bay, CBD, Orchard Road was all within 30 mins.

As i said our stay was OK, not outstanding and we would look for somewhere different to stay next time we are in Singapore.",,,217 ,96 ,3.0,

,Healthyfood,"Ok stay , not outstanding","We are staying in club room with executive lounge access.
The lounge is only open from 2pm till 10 pm with breakfast served in the main dining area, not the lounge, we cant fault the breakfast though,as it has a fabulous selection of many different foods catering for all nationalities the service is excellent, especially Wei Wei for her food recommendations and friendly chats, and Cedric for his great coffee. The service at breakfast is very efficient and well run.

The executive lounge is a little Dull and very little ambiance, last night (Saturday) no music was playing and it was whisper quiet with no atmosphere. We went one afternoon you could have soft drinks and hot drinks but there were no biscuits or afternoon treats like other club rooms we‚Äôve Been to. We found the evening drinks and nibbles excellent, the choices were different every night savoury and dessert and great quality. The service was good especially Jenny, who remembered our drink preferences and cleared plates quickly, she works really hard.
Our room is spotlessly clean and our room attendant Li Yen Hua has made an excellent job of making the room clean for us.
The 2 pieces of laundry a day has been a big plus.

Our main disappointment for us is the bed , for us it‚Äôs much to hard and has actually prevented us from having a good sleep. We requested after the first night for a mattress topper, which they provided although it isn‚Äôt much better. We both have sore joints and back ache from the hard bed, I understand everyone is different regards bed comfort, but this is the most uncomfortable bed we‚Äôve ever slept in , and we frequently stay in hotels of various stars. They advertise a pillow menu, but i rang to enquire and there are no softer pillows than the feather ones provided. Sleep is very important to us and for this reason we would probably not stay again as we haven‚Äôt so far had a restful night.

The pool area is just OK, no pool bar or restaurant which is disappointing, but it‚Äôs a clean pool and refreshing.

Asked for a later check out for two days time but denied, although told we can still use pool/spa facilities to freshen up before late flight, which is good.

Everything was in order, no hiccups, no unpleasant surprises.

We have gotten compliments from our guests that the food was awesome, quality was great, portion just right!
One of the best wedding food they had so far (no need Mcdonalds after our wedding dinner), zero complaints we have received so far.

Decoration of the ballroom was amazing! We love it totally.

Special thanks to a few that made this a wonderful experience; Agnes, Shawn & Grace.

Agnes:
Although our wedding proposal/agreement was not signed with you (signed with Hui Sian), you did your best to fulfill our requests & guided us through the whole planning process. Many advises from you which allows us to feel at ease & let your hotel to run it for us.
You made us feel assured that you got it all covered. Very friendly and approachable. Felt your passion towards your job & we can really see your effort to make our special day a memorable one.
Great work!

Shawn:
He took great care of our food, the program and the AV on our wedding day. We met him during the food tasting, he gave some advices & recommendations which were more applicable for us.
Special mention on the actual day, we ran into some issues with the AV. Almost couldn't have our videos played, he went an extra mile to find the compatible cable that finally works.

Grace:
She gave useful tips on march-ing in, what to expect, what to do, how to do, etc...
Really helpful & professional!
Got us all prepared & less anxious.

Definitely recommended!

Date of stay: October 2022,sig_icetea,Good staff makes alot of difference!,"Situated just right next to the Singapore River, Clarke Quay MRT station and Central shopping mall, Paradox is easily accessible and near to many amenities. It is also surprisingly tranquil and peaceful, and the ambience of the lobby is welcoming. Spot the motifs of crabs and more behind their counters, and the rich Peranakan history that adorns the lobby area! Beyond the splendid location and welcoming feel through their interior, what makes the experience a great stay is that the staff are attentive, polite and bright. Interactions with them are joyful and pleasant, even if it's just a greeting along the corridors.

The range of food that is put out for their buffet line for both dinner and breakfast are also good, offering a good variety for choice for diners. However, for some of them, it would be best avoided, such as the sausages for the breakfast - the casing was so solid that even the knife wasn't able to cut through!

While the experience is generally delightful, age can nonetheless be detected in the rooms based on their windows and films, as well as their closet and bathroom doors, where they may not fully close or have malfunctioning locks. The other gripe I may have with the room is that there are almost no USB charging ports, hence, do remember to pack your own should you need it for charging.",,"Singapore, Singapore",10 ,14 ,5.0,

There are 6-8 chefs but CAN'T handle topping up all the cold dishes, grilled corner.

At your grilled counter and waited 5 mins for the Fois Gra to be served onto my dish. There's a elderly chef busy topping up some food which is understandable in the wait. But there are 4 chefs in the kitchen not helping outside!!! Seem to be waiting for queue to build up ot invites to serve?? No word or smile from any chef or servicing staff. The look seem like: We own them a living!


The staff clearing tables and empty plate are instant and helpful. Extremely eager to remove our dishes when there are food remaining, even on a bowl of uneaten durian penget. We had been asked not less than 5 times by different staff when dishes are not empty.

When feedback to a service staff that the satays are hard like rubber, replied was 'it's not my satay, it's the company'. Extremely honesty.

When no chef are available at the grilled section to serve, wife queried a waitress and gotten a blank look and answer 'you must wait'. Isn't 'Can I help? I will help serve u at your table later' a 4 Star hotel answer???

Seriously, all the staff we encountered have no sense of ownership and responsibilities. Don't mention about service level, it do not exist.

Your restaurant name is right, entire operation run like a TYPICAL LOCAL MARKET. Overall your food quality is good but services are zero. The environment 5/10. DEFINITELY NOT ONE THAT DESERVES TO CHARGE $88++.

The old auntie probably made some mistake (i guess) but as a supervior/boss, It would be best if you could have a little EQ and leadership quality. Get your staff to work with you. Not work for you!!

The hotel amenities are also excellent. The room was spacious, and the bed was comfortable. Noteworthy also was that the room came with a large bathroom, with the basin inside- a rare commodity in Singapore hotels (based on our research). Another convenience was that the Smart TV allowed screensharing from our tablets.
The location of the hotel was also stellar. It's located right next to the Clarke Quay MRT station- making traversing across Singapore very easy. It's also right next to the Clarke Quay Mall, and Clarke Quay itself (along with the river).

We were allocated to the room that I booked.
Unfortunately one of the room keys didn't work at all. So only the other room key worked.
2nd of all, the room airconditioning was very poor, despite putting to lowest temperature with highest fan speed.
We called atleast few times to the operator. Operatore picked up after quite number of rings but did answer well to our queries. Maintenance staff came and did some repair work to aircon. But staff came and told us to change the rooms. They said they will feedback to the front desk and left.
We waited for the front desk to call us but didnt unfortunately. So we went down to the front desk and explained the situation in the room.
Front desk Kate informed that there was some misunderstanding but helped us immediately to upgrade us to a bigger room which was much much better. Thank you very much Kate.
After we relaxed abit in our upgraded room, we were given a call that we can check out late till 6pm. But we said 3pm is good enough. Very nice of the front desk staffs.
We went to evening canapes. They were very good but unfortunately there were no cocktails. Only the basic like wines, beers and spirits. Maybe if they can include some cocktails selection in the evening canapes will be good.
Next day breakfast was decent and good. But hopefully there can be more variety. Check out was swift.

Fast foward to May .

Before checking in , hotel emailed me asking for credit card details. I replied accordingly

Day of check in
I entered the lobby at 2.10 pm, the lobby area is nice and there are not much guests at that time.
After being attended by male recept, he said breakfast will be at in-house restaurant and evening cocktail will be served at lobby bar

I was slightly disappointed that the food and drinks won‚Äôt be served at club lounge
Then i noticed that club lounge at level 11 was closed
I entered the room , impressed by the room
The space is large enough to do HIIT
I look outside the window
It is not what I wanted
I had booked the room with river view in March!

I went to lobby bar and had coffee , no light snack provided . You need to pay for hot snack

Went for swimming and gym 2 hr later
I was impressed with swimming pool except the fact that blue potato bar was closed
After swimming , then go to toilet and dry myself
Then go to gym where I used threadmill
As I explored further, I went 2 storey of gym area , found elliptical cross trainer with river view. Thus I work out while looking at river and boats
Till then , went back to room and bath and went for evening cocktail at lobby bar
Had snack and cocktail (chargeable)
Went back to room and surf on laptop, then sleep

Date of stay: April 2022,Trev2810,Quiet but still a great place to stay,"This was our fourth stay at the Swissotel ( Paradox ) and our first time out of Australia since 2019 so we were very much looking forward to our week there ! We booked it back in 2021 when it was a Swissotel as the Accor loyalty program gives many benefits. It was disappointing to get the notification a few weeks before leaving that the hotel had changed hands and none of the loyalty benefits would be available as this was a big reason for booking. I hope the Paradox group come up with a loyalty program soon to benefit regular visitors.

Understandably, the hotel was much quieter than usual. The service from all the staff was still great - especially the front desk and concierge. The buffet breakfast wasn't fully up and running but the staff did a great job with the ""al a carte buffet "" style option.

COVID has obviously had an impact but for the price you pay I think the hotel could address a few issues. Firstly, on the new Paradox Singapore website that was launched only a week before we arrived it says the pool bar and restaurant is open - but it wasn't. I completely get that there may be reasons for it to be closed but don't say its open on the website when it isn't. Second, we had to call housekeeping on 3 occasions to service our room as it had not been done by late afternoon when we returned to the hotel. Finally, the rooms could do with a bit of refresh. We have been staying there since 2015 and I'm not sure there has been much done to the rooms in that time

Date of stay: January 2020,John L,How the Swissotel Staff changed our vacation from worst to best,"My family stayed here for 4 nights and I highly, highly recommend it.  Good location for sight seeing, breakfast buffet was fabulous, rooms were very clean and comfortable, etc etc.  But here is what set this hotel apart.On the morning of our departure, my mother-in-law announced that she had lost her diamond engagement ring probably the day before.  She was devastated.  It was expensive and of course had enormous sentimental value.  Search of her room and belongings turned up nothing.  This absolutely wiped out all the wonderful memories of our trip to Singapore.  We informed the hotel front-desk manager and described the ring.  This felt like a lost cause as the ring could have dropped off her finger anywhere.  Even if it was lost in the hotel, what are the chances it would be turned-in.But the Swissotel staff came to the rescue.  I received an email several days later saving they had found it.   One of the employees working in the bar area found it and turned it in.  It would have been so easy to slip the ring in their pocket and nobody would have known.  We worked with the hotel to arrange for oversees shipping and received the ring a short-time later.    We couldn't have been happier with the hotel and its staff.  They were so professional, accommodating, and genuinely made us feel cared for.Thank you for saving our vacation!!",,"Maple Glen, Pennsylvania",24 ,49 ,5.0,

We stayed in an Executive Room with use of the lounge where the staff were very welcoming. The rooms were well presented with good amenities and a plentiful supply of clean towels. I have stayed at the hotel in the past several times with my husband and we found the location excellent with an MRT close by. During the Covid outbreak, the hotel kept all the guests safe by using thermal scanning and an ample supply of hand sanitiser. We were very honoured to be invited to a ceremony to celebrate the end of the Chinese New Year which took place in the Ellenborough Cafe.

Date of stay: March 2020,Shasha Malik,Horrible Service From The Start,"My fiance and I were trying to book some rooms on our wedding day for ourselves and international guests but liaising with the team has been awful! Firstly, there was no dedicated relation manager to assist us in our bookings. We were thrown from one manager to another - overall, we liaised with 4 manager over a period of 3 weeks at least.

Whenever we arrived at the hotel to meet the manager, we had to wait and when we were supposed to meet person A, we had to speak to person B and go over the details again.
Our second experience was horrible as the manager on duty (another different person to liaise with) told me to just go to the counter to make payment even when I shared with her that I still have concerns on our booking (especially with the Covid-19 situation now).

I had to stand at the counter to share with her my concerns which was not any comfortable. A customer walked over and was shouting to her colleague about a lost passport. It would be gracious of the manager to sit me down somewhere that is much quieter and that we can discuss easily. Instead, she keeps insisting me to make payment and didn't address my concerns at all. Then her colleague interrupted me by talking to her.

From day 1, we felt that their services lack professionalism and we, as a young couple, were not taken any seriously. There was no sincerity in our interactions and they were too focused on us making payment for the rooms.",,"Singapore, Singapore",13 ,12 ,1.0,

It is right on the doorstep of Clarke Key. CK is without doubt the no. 1 place to be at night in Singapore ! My reservations about the hotel are really about the room quality & service levels. We upgraded at a cost of +90 dollars per night. Our new room certainly did not merit the cost of upgrade. It was badly configured & a big part of it was taken up with a businessmans desk. No good for tourists with suitcases. We had an issue one day with our room not being cleaned by the time we returned mid afternoon & we had dinner booked for 6.30. I managed to get help from Yousef in reception who organised cleaning within an hour of asking, but we had to sit around the pool whilst waiting. Fair play, he was a star !!!

As a Platinum member, I was extended early check in and late check out which I appreciated. However, there were 2 incidents which dampened the experience. 1) Due to the entire Corona issue, a temperature screening booth was set up at the main entrance. I applaud and support the initiative but there was no one manning the booth which made it useless. I highlighted this to the reception team who apologised and looked into it. However, when I went down to the lobby several hours later, once again the booth was empty. 2) I had contacted the hotel to request a small V-day cake for this celebration. The cake was not sent to the room and I called the team around 8pm to request for it. Despite the confirmation via email, the staff was apologetic and advised that there was no V-day cake prepared and offered a regular cake as a substitute which I accepted. However, closer to midnight, the staff came to deliver the actual V-day cake they had prepared which we declined since we were already quite full and were preparing for bed.

Tried breakfast on one day and found it okay (especially for vegetarian like me).

On day of checkout, requested for drinking water bottles around 1030 am but no one bothered to come even by 1145 hrs when i checked out. So pretty sure you can not expect much from them in terms of service.

So in my opinion, if your preference is location, pls go ahead elsewise its an average option.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"New Delhi, India",171 ,50 ,,3.0

An excellent swimming pool set at a level to see something of the skyline as you enjoy a swim.

Although this is right in the heart of things, the room that we had facing onto the side with the main entrance, was really quiet for such a busy city and within a stones throw of the river front and Clark Quay.

As a tourist you can walk to restaurants along the river or go into Chinatown - the Hippo Bus stop is nearby (just beyond the bunjee jump) and the river boats are even closer.

As we were getting a late night flight the hotel staff advised us that of course we could leave our bags and make use of the pool and the shower before we left for the airport. A most refreshing way to start a long haul flight.

The hotel itself is very classy, the service is impeccable and they really do take their customers‚Äô wishes seriously. The breakfast was very generous, and my favorite thing was a real honey comb plate, fresh every morningüòâ Yummy. The only thing that was a big disappointing was the quality of coffee.

We also had access to the executive lounge and from 6 pm to 8 pm we were offered light snacks and drinks, which for us was almost enough as a light dinner. It was a fantastic perk.
When we were checking out, we needed to leave all our 7 (!) bags for several hours at the hotel, and it was not a problem.

Wished the windows were clean so that can be viewed while relaxing. There was a pocket wifi in the room for the guests to use when they are out which was a nice touch.

There's a pillow menu but even the firm ones were too soft for me. That's an observation, not a criticism. Housekeeping could have been a bit more attentive in cleaning the bathroom sink.  The pool area is very nice and landscaped so it look a lot better than other hotels' standard oblong varieties.

Date of stay: August 2019,Esh123,AMAZING hotel located in the PERFECT LOCATION!!,"The Swissotel Merchant Court hotel was an amazing place to stay. We arrived with a great warm greeting and were blessed with the AC in the lobby!!

The receptionist checked us in and alongside this provided us with a map of Singapore. She explained to us where some of the key locations in Singapore were and the best ways to get there as well as the distance/time to get to these places.

Our room was amazing!! Perfectly clean and had a stunning view over the streets. The bathroom was very good quality (as if it was refurbished recently) and complimentary bottled of water were provided daily by housekeeping. Each room has a complimentary phone with unlimited .data to use (which is beneficial if you're from abroad and cannot send or receive messages via data). Also each room had a portable WiFi (yogofi) which was the most beneficial thing provided EVER!! It helped us connect all our devices up and connect to the internet so whenever we went out, we could still message each other and discover new places in üá∏üá¨ on Google maps.

The pool was relatively big and was maintenaned daily. It had a good overlooking view of the city and also a few skyscrapers. I would recommend going to the pool in the late afternoon (around 4pm) so you don't feel too much heat but not too cold either. The Gym was absolutely amazing in the Swissotel. I was able to go at 11pm and finish at 1am without any issues (as it's a 24hr gym). The equipment was maintenaned very well and was good quality. There was a lot more equipment than I initially thought - there were dumbbells, benches, treadmills, weighted balls, bench press equipment and even a leg press machine. In addition, there was always a plate of apples when you enter alongside some towels, a jug of infused water and a freezer with cold ice towels! The treadmills were impeccable as you can watch YouTube videos on them too! If you go to the top floor of the gym, you would be greeted to a stunning view over Clarke Quay and the bars across the river.

The location was PERFECT! About 20mins walk to the Merlion and just over half an hour to the Marina Bay Sands. The nightclub district (Clarke Quay) was only 2 mins away - literally outside and across the bridge. Being near Clarke Quay MRT station allowed us to take trains to various areas of Singapore (both North, South, East and West). I would highly recommend staying at this hotel especially if you're keen to explore the city of Singapore a lot! If you want to visit Chinatown guess what? It's about a 5 minute walk away! And there are a few convenience stores nearby which have all necessities needed for your trip.

The staff were amazing (as mentioned earlier). They always help you even when you're very confused with directions and even where to find an Indian restaurant! All staff from cleaners to doormen to receptionists strived to make each guests stay a pleasurable one and this was evident during our stay.

If there's only one con, it was that the breakfast option was pretty expensive. However, booking room only for a few nights and popping over to the shopping centre (LITERALLY OPPOSITE the hotel) means you can grab a nice coffee and pastry or subway for a good price and guaranteed of being full!!

I'd like to thank everyone at the Swissotel Merchant Court for making our stay an amazing one and I would definitely recommend staying here on your trip to Singapore!",Trip type: Travelled with family,"London, United Kingdom",7 ,14 ,5.0,
Date of stay: August 2019,triumvirat11,Currently staying but it has been horrible,"Well I made a reservation when Accor SuperSale at May which promised nicely at.least.30% off and free breakfast but fully prepaid. So I assumed my reservation includes breakfast but I found that it was not the case when I checked in. So they requested my original reservation details which they should know. And strangly Accor app did not show even the correct information either with wrong payment details further. It took so much time for check in too as the agent was not knowlegable for all the process and details and she kept asking the details all the time to her colleagues and her supervisor. Even her supervisor was not well informed how to spend the Accor points for the breakfast when I found out that my reservation did not include breakfast. Anyway, checked in and moved to the room, all of sudden after 2 hrs which was after 10pm already, a different lady called us to propose different arragements to leverage my Accor membership status to allow us to have breafast which ended up paying extra dollars of course but nice executive benefits she claimed. I had to accept that as we had to pay much more if we did not accept that offer. And she needed my signiture around 11 pm when my wife and daughter were already asleep. Well I had to do that if we wanted to have breakfast the day after. The arrangment made us change the room which made us pack and unpack again the day after.  The hotel promised to call us the day after to inform us when the room change can happen but it never happened. We ended up calling the front desk to check and kept checking when the new room would be ready.  Well all these efforts, we thought we finally can relax but the room keys caused the troubles again which should allow us both 5th and 11th floor which allows us to access the executive lounge which was the part of arrangements. But we could not access 11th floor where the executive louge located with the changed keys. We had to get down to the front desk again and asked the update and later we found out that we now can access only 11th not 5th. And again got down to the reception to update the keys.  Already exhausted with Swissotel merchant court and Accor membership. Everything is slow here and hotel is old which is not the quality of Singspore we expected.

All the members of the property are awesome as both individuals and professionals, and only because of their awesomeness can they provide such remarkable services to their guests.

Mr. Fenady, Senior Concierge is incredible. Concierge is an integral part of a hotel because he‚Äôs like a sergeant in the army and without the right one to guide us regarding road maps, tour operators and what‚Äôs trending what‚Äôs not, our trip can be a disaster. But this gentleman is simply fabulous. The way he interacts with his guests and colleagues most likely contribute to his attributions of being great and likeable. He makes sure that all his guests are treated with utmost care. He's kind and cordial as well. He‚Äôs an asset to the property.

Mrs. Ane Alfaro , Service Quality Manager is peerless. When guests arrive at the hotel, she only get a few minutes to make a great first impression and it's effortlessly impressive. She‚Äôs friendly and sweet to talk to. She‚Äôs a gem.

Mrs. YiJie, from the reservations is brilliant. She helped me get my reservation done smoothly and gave me a very good deal.

Mrs. Gayle, Mr. Rajino, the two duty managers , Mrs. Maria the AFOM and Ms. Rachel are peerless. Majority of the guest handling responsibility falls in the hands of the duty managers , front office officers and their dedication and promptness is unmatchable.

Mr. Mike, Mr. Allen, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Gobi, Mr. Sugan, Mr. Yana , Mr. Mel are outstanding and hard working. They make their guest feel welcomed and at home. They are helpful.

All the above mentioned names are professionals who set the tone of the entire experience that the guests will get from their stay. I appreciate the extra mile they rendered in assisting me with everything I needed.

The housekeeping (all of them )are trustworthy efficient and good.

The GM of the property is a fantastic man. He makes sure that all his guests are well taken care of.

There‚Äôs this lovely girl at the bar counter , I forget her name , a young girl by the name Fo or Vo may be,Ms. Belle and Ms. Elle have been superb with their services.

I was looking for a holiday with a blend of luxury, relaxation, warm hospitality, excellent food, spacious rooms with a view and I am glad I made the right choice and it was my mother ‚Äòs suggestion to stay at this esteemed property where she stayed for ten days last year along with my sister and I stayed for 13 or 14 nights

Swissotel Merchant Court is the best in Singapore in terms of location, safety, spacious rooms, comfort, services and food. You‚Äôll never regret staying here. Highly recommended hotel.

Thanks a ton to all of them for their fabulous services and for making my stay a memorable one. Hope to have more such memorable stay at your property with all the lovely people around. All the best to the entire team of Swissotel. May you continue with your excellent hospitality!

We found the towels were rather hard like sandpaper and they need new ones that are fluffy.  Water saver shower heads should not be installed in hotels as the flow of water is terrible. Had no decent clock that you could see when you wake at night so we went and purchased one. Our toilet was in a tiny alcove behind the door and rather awkward to use.  We did not eat at the buffet meals as they did not have enough food we liked.  The best thing going for it was the great location.  It is just a few minutes walk to Clark Quay which has literally hundreds of restaurants on each side of river with a walk bridge across.  We ate at these each night for quite reasonable prices.  The actual hotel sold yummy banana splits at the swimming pool eatery.  BEWARE of using the foyer to exchange currency as they put their own rate on it and not what is the exchange rate at the time.

At check in the process was smooth and easy. On the first night we stayed in a Vantage room and during our second stay in an Executive room. Both were corner rooms so more spacious and very comfortable.Housekeeping kept everything clean and tidy and the evening turn down service was an added bonus.
As Executive guests we had use of the Club Lounge which was a welcome oasis. We had breakfast there which was plentiful with a good choice of food including cooked items. Happy hour tended to be a bit a frantic due to the behaviour of some of the other guests who piled their plates with food seemingly oblivious to the fact it was meant for everyone.
Service throughout the hotel was exemplary. When I became ill during our stay the hotel helpfully arranged for a doctor to visit me and later a member of staff checked on my progress which was much appreciated.
The hotel is in a good central location and next to an MRT station which is handy for getting out and about. Clarke Quay has an array of bars and restaurants and we were never bothered by noise at night. It is quite pricey to eat there and cheaper places can be found elsewhere. We had a drink by the pool at the Blue Parrot which was very pleasant but other than breakfast we didn't eat in the hotel.

On our return to SIN at the end of pour cruise, we disembarked early and were still given immediate access to our room; first class.

Rooms are spacious and equipped and furnished as you would expect for a first-class hotel. More than enough space with an excellent bathroom (although the shower on our second stay was somewhat temperamental running either very hot or freezing cold!)

Location is spot-on; just across the river from the very enjoyable Clarke Quay and its restaurants & bars, while it's only a 5 minute easy stroll to the superb MRT Metro/Subway system.

Was there a downside; inevitably (for us) - yes. The cost of the breakfast buffet, if you are not a huge eater, was, in our opinion, excessive. Would have been nice if there was an a la carte choice of smaller options, rather than the full blow-out or nothing! On our second stay, we opted not to use the breakfast buffet, but found a great little eatery very nearby for a far more reasonable price.

The room was perfect, clean, spacious, the bathroom immaculate. For once we had no noise in our room, no neighbours leaving to catch planes at 1 am!
The location is ideal, next door to the MRT, short distance to Vivo City, Raffles Place, and Orchard Rd. We could walk to Chinatown, Peoples Place. Clarke Quay was next door, if you like pubs and restaurants.

We are extremely delighted and pleased throughout the planning stage and on the actual day's execution, as such, we are strongly recommending couples to hold their Wedding at this wonderful Hotel.

Special mention to our Sales Coordinator, Crescent Lim, who was the key person responsible for this success. She was proactive in engaging us a few months leading up to the actual day. Under her constant guidance and expert advice, all aspects of the actual day's plan (ie Menu, Audio Video, Guest List, Schedule) were clearly communicated. Most importantly, she could understand our vision of the actual day. Kudos to her professionalism and relationship-led attitude.

Not forgetting the Banquet Manager and Operations team on the actual day, Grace & Brandan. Both were extremely detailed on the actual day, which we strongly believe was the one of the contributing factor to the success of the event. Where there were hiccups or areas that we did not foresee in our plan during the event, they were able to come to us with solutions, instead of pushing the problem back to us to solve.

Overall, we are impressed with the decision making process and professionalism of the whole team, standing by us from the planning stage to actual day's execution. I am confident that anyone who engage this team (ie Crescent, Grace, Brandan and their team) to hold their wedding banquet, they should look forward to a memorable experience.

It is just steps from Merchants Quay, which is a fun place to have dinner, drinks, people watch and catch a boat tour of the harbor to see the light and water show at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.  The hotel is clean, classy, upscale and a great value for the price.  I slept like a baby every night on a very comfortable bed! What REALLY made this hotel special though was the staff! We were greeted off the taxis daily by Allen and Gobi. Both could not have been more cheerful, helpful and attentive. Allen spent a great deal of time telling my husband the best places to go and giving us great tips and advice for seeing Singapore.  Allen noticed that my husband was limping and wearing a knee brace. We heard a little tap at our door, and Allen had gone all the way to Chinatown for a special Chinese herbal liniment. He would not let us give him a dime for it!! We were so touched at this kind gesture! They gave us bottled waters every time we walked out the door, which was very helpful in this heat. Then, when Gobi saw us come in late from our fun evening out, he brought my son a special birthday cake at midnight to wish him happy birthday as my son turned 25, since Gobi wasn't going to be there in the morning when we left to see him.  The staff brought another cake the next morning, with a personal birthday message.  We have traveled all over the world and stayed in much more expensive hotels than this, but never have we had this kind of personal, sweet, thoughtful attention and service.

The hotel is ideally situated in Clarke Quay, central to everything. Straight across from the hotel in the Central Mall is access to MRT from where you can get anywhere cheaper than taxi's.
The hotel is a nice, clean with very pleasant staff who cannot do enough for you. From the moment we arrived we were treated very well. Check in was easy and quick. Our bags were taken to our room and we were shown all the gadgets that were available for use in the room.
We had a superior room, which was great but lacked wardrobe space. There was also very little drawer space. We lived out of our case. Despite this the room was comfortable, air conditioned and complete with Iron and board, kettle, fridge, large television and a nice bathroom. There was a hairdryer for the ladies and a safe in the room.
The bar was very good but also expect to pay high prices as per anywhere in Singapore. We did not use the restaurant as there are far too many places to eat for a lot cheaper than the hotel.
We had use of the Handy phone which was great and saved us a fortune in calls back home, you also have use of a mobile wifi system, which is so useful. The Handy phone can be used to booked tickets to attractions around the city. Make sure you use this it is very convenient and free.
When you leave the hotel, it is less than a minutes walk into Clark Quay, where you find fantastic restaurants and bars right by the riverside. Plenty of live music is being played in most bars.

During night time, we could feel the bustle of nightlife as the colourful neon lights lit up along the Singapore river right at the comfort of our balcony.

The location is perfect for club goers but not less for families too. There is a mall, Central Mall, located strategically beside the hotel and Liang Court is only less than 10 min casual walk from hotel. We went there for Japanese cuisine and also visited Kinokuniya. We also headed to the nearby Harry‚Äôs bar for some beer and it was cool just chilling there.

Buffet variety for breakfast was average but I really liked the ambience. Food variety during cocktail time at the executive lounge was a little limited much to our dismay as we had expected more after looking at online reviews. The male staff was attentive to our needs though which did make up for the shortfall.

Everything was perfect but if the staff at the lobby (reception and concierge counters) were to be a little friendlier , smile a little more and appear more approachable, I would have given a five star rating. When I stood at the lobby waiting for check-in , I did not receive any greetings nor anyone asking if I needed help. I felt a little helpless there.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the very courteous Allen; he handed us some moist towels and cold bottled water to refresh ourselves and beat the heat.

Check-in was quick and easy, we were assisted by the helpful Alice and Sat; Since we arrived noon and there were no rooms available, Alice mentioned that they will call us as soon as a room becomes available.

Allen mentioned we could use their facilities to freshen-up and we could also leave our luggages with them should we want to venture out while waiting for a room and even suggested places to visit and areas to get good food and shopping.

The facilities were very nice and clean, the room was well kept and quite comfortable and includes a free to use pocket wifi and a free to use mobile phone which makes going around and keeping connected online very convenient.

The location of the hotel is very convenient for going around; very close to places where one can get food as well as transportation, most specially the train.

Check-out was also very good; they even let me leave my luggages as I went around again after check-out as my flight was at midnight. Same as when we arrived, we were allowed to use the facilities to freshen up to prepare for out flight in the evening.

I wasn't able to use all the hotel's facilities but I think that would be in the list when I return.

In the next morning, I called to your front office counter for more than an hour continuously, but nobody received the call so far. I wondered how we could contact your front desk people or we must go down ourselves to meet them. After we checked out, we went out to take a cab. We saw one concierge staff standing there, and no one was waiting for a cab there.  We wanted to approach him to ask for his help to wave a cab coming in. However, he pretended not seeing us and walked away. I noticed that there was a signal stating that hotel guests going to the airport will take first priority. Although we were not going to the airport, nobody was waiting for a cab at that moment. Why the hotel concierge staff did not approach to us to offer a help or he thought that we were not hotel guests who were going to the airport?  Only hotel guests going to the airport will be served by the hotel concierge staff, is it correct? We just checked out, does it mean that we are not hotel guests and so it is not necessary for him to do anything for the check-out guests?

Never waited for more than a few minutes. (In some SG hotels, there is usually a queue to get a cab - in spite of Grab). After trying many hotels in SG, I have settled on this one.

Date of stay: July 2018,maypark68,Fantastic Hotel,"Stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court last week and it was fantastic especially the location!
Been to Singapore and stayed in different hotels and apartments and must say this is one of the best!
I was with my 2 children and as usual never felt unsafe at all anywhere in Singapore.
Check in was a little slow due to been a Saturday and there was a lot of people checking out. I asked for a quiet part of the hotel as we had a couple of nights at Legoland the 2 previous nights and needed a good rest. We were put on the ninth floor facing the Clarke Quay shopping mall, which was fine as it was quiet.
The room was spacious with a small hall way with the bathroom off one side then the room.The shower over the bath was a bit off putting with 2 children climbing in and out but it was fine as my son wanted a bath one night.
Everything was provided in the room Nespresso machine (which I didn't use, as I don't drink coffee but had some beautiful teas which I thoroughly enjoyed!)
WiFi, a complimentary handy phone which was fantastic to use all around Singapore and we made international calls back home to my husband in Australia.
That was great for the kids to speak to their dad a couple of times a day!
We used the MRT a lot (as my kids loved the train) and it was situated at the back of the hotel which was so convenient and occasionally took the taxi for longer journeys, which was always a plenty in front of the hotel.
We had breakfast included in package which was very nice, the staff were very friendly and attenitive but next time I don't think I bother as there was so many places to eat near by and China town was only a block away with heaps to eat as well!
Clarke Quay was pretty spectacular at night and a must see especially for the kids!
The stay was very enjoyable and very recommendable!
Prior to arriving as we lost our pre-booked apartment due to a managers fault for over booking and telling us 3 weeks prior to leaving that they were fully booked.
Rang up Swissotel and spoke to the wonderful reservation lady name 'CHADY' she gave us a price and a couple of days later when I rang to confirm the price had gone up slightly but to Chadys credit she honoured the prices a a couple of days earlier and she also included a one-time afternoon tea.
On top of that a couple of days into our stay we received a box of chocolates, a fruit platter and a card from her asking us if we were enjoying our stay!
A lovely thought from her made our stay even more enjoyable!

Room was great, spacious and very comfortable. Bathroom well appointed. We had fresh bottled water every day, good quality tea and nespresso coffee machine, replenished daily, so we were very happy.

The bar offered a good price for happy hour drinks, but it was empty most of the time so we didn‚Äôt try it. The hotel has a little wine bar with a few tables on the quayside, but a bottle of wine was nearly 20dollars more expensive than the bar (with tables by the quayside..) about 50 feet away so we didn‚Äôt bother!

Since our last visit a few years ago, the hotel has had a contemporary makeover which we felt had left it a bit soulless.  The reception area is functional but bare.  The colour schemes would not be to everyone's taste with the carpets in the hallways leading to the rooms deserving special mention for being rather garish.  But it's all a matter of taste...Fortunately the rooms were more tasteful and our Premier room and bathroom were very modern, clean and comfortable, and everything worked very well.  A smart phone in rooms allowing free international calls and internet access was a nice touch for navigating around the island. Breakfast buffet in the Ellenborough Market Cafe was good with a wide ranging choice of Asian and Western options.  However, the service was not up to scratch.  We noticed that tables were left uncleared and several of the staff seemed keener to talk and joke among themselves than do their jobs.  We had to chase them on a couple of occasions.  The pool area is very good and there is an excellent spa and fitness facilities.  We thought the hotel had lost some of its previous charm and reputation for first rate service.  But the draw for many people, including us, remains its position on the Singapore River and opposite the bustling nightlife of Clarke Quay as well as nearby Boat Quay.  It is also very close to the Clarke Quay MRT station and a 15 min stroll to Chinatown and the Merlion (via Boat Quay).  It remains a good option for a stay in Singapore due mainly to its position rather than any other attributes.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,UK,154 ,324 ,4.0,

Well located with the Clark Quay restaurant hub across the river, a mall and MRT station just across the road. The room was small and I have a feeling the receptionist pulled a fast one over me when she said she was upgrading me to a higher floor and better category of room. I had a view of another buildings windows. Breakfast was a good spread typical western and Asian mix. The pair of cooks on the egg station were artists and doing a wonderful job.

The location was good, near the MRT and the harbourfront. Easy walk to Chinatown as well. Room as expected for a 5* hotel with all the little touches that you could possibly need! Appreciated there was room in the fridge to put some fresh milk that we prefer and the water they provide every day.  We enjoyed the pool, although not enough loungers for the number of guests, but the gym was fully equipped and by the pool which was convenient.  Only had one meal and snacks so hard to comment on food, but the service was good. We very much appreciated a very early check in on arrival after our long flight It made such a difference to have our room so early, although you can shower in the changing rooms by the gym if your room is not available so early. We got a good deal for the room through booking.com, but felt the food prices were on the pricey side, albeit probably normal for a 5* hotel!  The staff were friendly and helpful.

Date of stay: February 2018,thomasvJ3846DN,Swiss excellence in Singapore,"Finding the right hotel for your stay in Singapore is never an easy task and it took us some time to agree on the Swissotel Merchant Court. I'm happy to say that we did not regret our decision. Whereas the room rates are rather on the higher side, the hotel does live up to its expectations on all fronts.

Situated alongside the Singapore river, the Swissotel offers a perfect base for exploring the city centre. Chinatown, Little India and even the Marina Bay are all within walking distance. The hotel building may appear a bit classical from the outside (especially compared to some of Singapore's more recent hotel venues) but it has a modern interior and is equipped with all the amenities one might look for in this category: excellent (and comprehensive) breakfast buffet, outdoor pool, a large gym with spa and sauna. Our room was situated in one of the corners of the building and offered nice views of downtown Singapore. Everything, and by this I mean truly everything, from the Nespresso machine to the lobby, is well-maintained and very clean.

Finally, I would also like to thank the friendly staff whose warm welcome made our stay even more enjoyable, in particular doorman Gobi and Irene from the reception. We hope to stay here again soon and will highly recommend the Swissotel Merchant Court to our friends.",Trip type: Travelled as a couple,z√ºrich,5 ,1 ,5.0,

Bars and restaurants close by sell beers from  ¬£4 a glass and wine at ¬£6 a glass. On our second restaurant meal we just had water  and had our drinks elsewhere - unsurprisingly the Blue Potato restaurant was empty on both nights, so the service was good. It is a pity as the food is very good and location is al fresco overlooking the pool but people look for other restaurants with sensible wine prices.",,"Felixstowe, United Kingdom",153 ,104 ,3.0,

Best excursion - go on MRT to Bayfront (one change) from Clarke Quay. Buy a return because big queues at Bayfront. Go up to bar on top of Marina Sands Hotel.

It wasn't helped that the waitress did not speak English. We wanted a la carte breakfast but couldn't get the member of staff to understand us.  She went away and conferred with a manager, but he didn't even come over to speak to us.

Clarke Quay itself (nightclubs galore) is just across the river and the thriving Boat Quay restaurant strip only 5 minutes walk away. Despite this, we never had any noise issues.  The only negatives were that the beds were definitely on the hard side, and too many of the drinks on the Crossroads bar cocktail list were unavailable.

On this trip we were only staying two nights and the rooms had been prepaid so I strongly object to being asked for $400 for the 2 rooms. That merely improves their cash flow at our expense.

Due to flight times we arrived early, 8:00am and expected to store our luggage until a room was available. Instead we ended up paying $20 for an upgrade to a better room which was available immediately and it gave us access to the club lounge. We used the club lounge straight away for breakfast then slept for about 5 hours as we got no sleep on the flight. Our room was spacious, clean and had great views of the river. The staff were awesome. When we checked out they knew we had a late flight so they offered to store our bags and make use of the pool, changing rooms and showers until we were ready to go - which we did, we ended up relaxing by the pool, a great way to refresh before the next 12 hour flight. During our stay we needed to sign legal documents for a home we're selling and the staff were extremely helpful with printing etc.  This place is a little on the pricey side but inline with what you pay for in Singapore. With the extra early checkin and extra late checkout, we felt that we had three days for the price of one. It was great value for money. Finally, the location by Clarke Quay is perfect.

This being said there were a few shortcomings: I had requested connecting rooms at the time of booking (which was 6 months prior to the stay), however upon checkin we were informed they had no connecting room available. We were given 2 adjacent rooms, which was OK, but not ideal. The rooms were at ground floor level, with lots of vegetation in front of the window, therefore quite dark. They both had a strong moldy smell as soon as the AC was off. Rooms and bathrooms are adequate, nothing fancy but service their purpose. The children said the internet was poor (bad connection). We had dinner at the blue potatoe, which was good, though the setting was not as nice as we had expected from the internet pictures.

When we told them we were not happy they said that they would move us the next day. We checked with reception twice the next day and rang several times but got nowhere with moving. Finally I got angry and explained that this was spoiling the start to our holiday and wasting part of our time in Singapore. We then got 3 people to our very small room to help us move to a bigger room with a double bed. We were not the only couple with this problem we talked to another couple who were also not given the room they booked.

The room, while not exactly the most spacious, was comfortable enough. It was also clean, which we appreciated. The view from the room allocated to us was not what we had hoped for, though.

We had booked an executive room, which came with the lounge access. Lounge was alright, with a decent selection of drinks and good service in general. Shirley was especially friendly with our toddler, and took extra care of her when we were in the lounge. The food selection was however somewhat limited, especially for breakfast.

Facilities were pretty much standard, with nothing standing out in particular. Our toddler's favourite was the pool, which had a couple of water slides that she enjoyed playing with. The pool area, however, was crowded most of the time, and we had some problems trying to even get hold of an available deck chair. Most times in the day, it was a common sight to see people standing around waiting for guests to vacate deck chairs.

This hotel fit the bill, and we were not disappointed on arrival. The hotel is immaculately clean (the whole place smells like a spa!), the room was well equipped and the bed comfy (there is also a pillow menu, which I wish we had discovered sooner). The only hiccup that we encountered, was that when we checked in, the room we had been allocated, per our online booking, was not ready (at 4:00 pm), and still two hours from being so! The situation was quickly remedied however, so all was good. Public transportation is nearby, and cabs are plentiful. Getting to most touristy places from this hotel ran about $10 in a cab - to our minds, one of the best values in Singapore!
We did not take them up on the breakfast add-on. This seemed expensive at $36/person. We ate at the restaurant there, but just ordered a la carte, which worked out to be a better deal. As for other meals, Clarke's Quay has more than enough choice!

My room had both a shower and bathtub, however - the shower was built into a corner and the glass doors had no rubber molding...the only places to stand faced the door, and because there were gaps on either vertical side of the door....water inevitably got all over the bathroom floor. There was no drain in the bathroom floor either....

If you're going to stay at a Swissotel in Singapore, I would recommend the Stanford. Unfortunately it was sold out and I moved to the Merchant Court location.

We were not disappointed. We checked in late as our flight didn't get into to Changi until 9pm. We were welcomed warmly and checked in fairly quickly.
Our room was large enough for our 2 night stay although I found the desk was a nuisance with its positioning especially if my husband sat in the armchair as it put me in the way of the tv.
We had a walk-in shower, as requested, which was a very good size. The bathroom was not huge but it was well laid out.
The view was of the street but who goes to Singapore to look out of a hotel window?
We didn't use any of the hotel facilities except the bar and the staff in the bar were very welcoming.
The hotel enjoys a great location. Clarke Quay for night life if wanted. The MRT and bus stops are all within easy reach of the hotel and Chinatown was also only a few minutes walk up the street.

The restaurant breakfast was delicious with a huge range of options.

My only gripe was with the check-in. I arrived a little early and my room wasn't ready yet, so I was given a free drink voucher and asked to wait in the bar until they told me it was ready. After an hour of waiting I went back to reception and was told that it was ready now. I asked how long it had been ready and whether anyone had planned to tell me about it, but was just met with a blank stare.

Hotel location is very convenient near to Clarke Quay and easy access to Taxis, MRT and Bus.  We spent 4 nights there and enjoyed our stay.  Check in was fast. They even allowed us early check in. Front desk is helpful but Mangement Staff is quite lame and slow in response to your emails. Send them 3 mails and expect one reply (if you are lucky!!)   But reception staff is good and efficient.  Advisable to put cash deposit at time of check in instead of Credit Card as many guests are complaining abt the same.  All in all it's value for money and decent hotel in this Clarke Quay area.

Unfortunately,  I couldn't really enjoy this bar, as the hotel has a strict no smoking policy.

Firstly if you can afford to upgrade to the Executive rooms/suites, do it! The little bit extra you pay is totally worth the exceptional service, rooms and food/drinks on offer.
The staff in the Exec Lounge are very good at their jobs and make sure you have everything you want; especially Norrish who is a very lovely young lady. She ended up making me 3 coffees each with different milk until it was exactly how I like it and I wasn't complaining about the coffee, she could just tell I hadn't enjoyed it. The third coffee she brought to our room after we left the Lounge, I hadn't asked her to but it was perfect and much appreciated.
The happy hour each night is a relaxed and enjoyable way to start your night or end your day, depending on your energy level. We thoroughly enjoyed the French wines on offer and exquisite glasses they were served in. 6-8pm each night.
Breakfast is in the same room, or you can go down to the main restaurant like we did on our last morning as we had an early start. We were happy with what was on offer in the lounge.
The rooms are a decent size, we had enough room for 2 hard cases to be open fully side by side and still have walking room.
The room amenities are lovely, I especially liked the loofah sponge, TWG Teas, and Swiss chocolates.
We used the pool a couple of times and my partner went to the gym. The spin bikes are on the top level on the multi-tiered gym and overlook the river and Clarke Quay so its a nice place to workout.

Date of stay: July 2016,EHOG,Stay with mixed feelings - a few problems but always rectified,"After staying for more than 100 nights, I think I should write a review for this hotel.

Location is 1st class. CQ purple line station right below the hotel and downtown line for Chinatown is just 300meters away and 80% sheltered. There are two malls nearby, Chinatown point and Central. Or you can take a direct train to vivocity.

Service is top notch. Front desk staff, breakfast staff, exec. lounge staff are all extremely friendly and very helpful. When there are issues, they will always go above and beyond to help. The team is seriously on par with the service quality of the Tier 1 hotels. But there are a couple of issues I have with the hotel which I will get onto this later.

Room is average. Very comfortable bed but rooms are generally small unless you're given an upgrade. I have issues with the bathroom, the rooms don't come with stand-in shower now, you'll have to climb into a bathtub to use the shower and it is not a low bathtub, might not be suitable for older people. you'd have to hold the handle tight when you step out of it. Shower pressure is inconsistent across all the rooms (I've stayed in many) but what really gets on my nerves is the inconsistent water temperature which is either too hot or too cold. It takes a long time for the water temperature to respond to the lever on the mixer as well. Some rooms are better than others. Whenever I had an issue with my room, the staff were always happy to assist with a room change and they never treat you like a difficult customer when you make your request.

One advice I'd give the hotel is to leave the full amenities in all the rooms. While I understand that you can provide them when customers make a request but things like toothbrush for a 5 star hotel is expected. The higher grade rooms don't have this issue.

Breakfast is really good. They serve you TWG tea or you can order coffee. Asian food selection is amazing, you get delicious porridge and even local delicacies like nasi lemak. Croissants are great. Don't expect things like fresh fruit juice, remember the price point of the hotel. Generally very good selection. Exec lounge has decent food during tea time and drink selection is impressive too. In-room dining food is reasonably priced and are generally of good quality.

Laundry is professional, expensive but slightly cheaper than some other 5 star hotels. I haven't had anything gone missing after using their laundry service for many years.

Recently, I noticed a wrongly charged minibar consumption and I was very sure I did not make the consumption. After informing the hotel, based on trust I guess, they reversed the amount which is not big. But it's a matter of principle. I do think it is important for the hotel to inform the guest whenever they notice any minibar consumption to resolve potential dispute on the same day.

All in all, if you can accept the limitations that i've mentioned, you can stay here for great service quality and location.",Trip type: Travelled on business,,39 ,53 ,4.0,

Food and drinks, hot and cold, can be ordered round the pool and this is a lovely way to chill out on a peaceful warm sultry evening.  A very nice hotel situated in walking distance of lots of street entertainment but for attractions further afield grab a taxi, they're very reasonable.

Hard to be too critical of a renovation programme, unless you happen to be the one staying there when kit happens.The main problem is that there is a pretty rubbish make-shift bar. like some badly done pop up bar.

The room was fine - but very much on the functional side in my view. Bathroom was well finished but small. This hotel is not in the same league as the Mandarin Orchard though in terms of quality of finish I have to say.  That hotel was fully booked and so I decided to try a different location and from that point of view this hotel worked well. It is a few minutes walk into the Clark Quay complex where you have a wide choice of bars and restaurants.   Staff on the desk were fine. For some reason the receptionist split my bill over two cards which was a little confusing. Still no big deal.

The check in clerk explained that the room was on the executive floor and included complimentary breakfast and happy hour each day. We are so glad we accepted the upgrade (a big thank you to Swissotel Merchant Court). Happy hour was unlimited drinks from 6pm to 8pm and the breakfast was a buffet, which was smaller than that offered in the restaurant but very good with lots of choices.

This hotel is also EXTREMELY convenient for business travelers. First, it is connected to the subway station. Second, it is across the street from a giant modern shopping mall and trendy restaurant complex called Clarke Quay. Third, it is walking distance to Chinatown.

When we arrived at in the room there was a distinct smell of concrete dust and later (next day) the room in fact filled with dust. At first we were accused of smoking in our room but finally the staff came to their senses and realized that it was construction dust. The Staff were then very apologetic and in particular Anna the duty manager  was most helpful and upgraded us an executive suite with much less noise and included breakfast in the executive lounge daily for the remainder of our stay. from then on our stay was much more enjoyable In my opinion there were rooms that not should have been used and the bulk should have been heavily discounted (or upgraded like we were eventually) and advised prior to arrival -  a failure on the hotels management side.,Trip type: Travelled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",55 ,46 ,4.0,

My family and I stayed at Swissotel Mercant Court for four days. Great location, spacy room and a very fantastic pool-area. However, all these nice surroundings looses the value when you get very sick.
One evening my wife had something for dinner that made her very sick. After an awfull night, the situaion was beginning to be quite critical and we decided to call reception for assistance.
From the very beginning, we got an extremely professional service. The hotel arranged a doctor to arrive only 20 minutes after we made our call - including an ambulance!! It was decided my wife needed to go to the hospital and suddenly we were in the situation that we had to leave our son at the hotel all by himself. However, the hotel made sure he was in safe hands looking well after him.

Luckily, my wife was stabilized after a few hours and we were able to go back to the hotel.
During the rest of our stay we had a very friendly staff asking how she was doing and if we needed any assistance.

It's in a situation like this you realise what good service really means.

Date of stay: June 2015,SimonsdadAdelaide,"Location, location, location.","The Swissotel, Merchant Court is a bit of an anachronism in modern Singapore. It's not particularly large, has only a dozen or so floors and is a bit of a rabbit warren if you have a room too far away from the lifts. The hotel is clean, particularly in the public areas, and staff were continually dusting and polishing the wooden shutters in the lobby. The rooms themselves were good, ( we had 586 ) and while attempts had obviously been made to upgrade the bathrooms, the standard of the work left a lot to be desired. There were extensive renovations being carried out on the second floor, so the noise  carried throughout the hotel. luckily, the work started at 8.00am and finished at 6.00pm. so it really didn't cause too much inconvenience for us. I can't comment on their food, as with Clarke Quay being only a 2 minutes walk away , why would you eat anywhere else. Boat Quay is 10 minutes away in the opposite direction, so the hotel is right in the centre of the waterfront nightlife scene, with all the pubs, clubs, restaurants, discos and whatever else you fancy right at the hotel doorstep.  The hotel staff were cheerful, always helpful and immediately moved two of our friends when they complained about the renovation noise. The hotel is old, at least by Singapore standards, it's tired and desperately needs a face-lift.

Great views from the kid friendly pool that has a waterslide. Friendly staff that provided a complimentary bottle of wine in our room. We didn't get the breakfasts in our deal as they were too expensive and chose to eat breakfast from coffee shops and bakeries of which there are plenty and alot cheaper.
Make sure you sign up to the Swissotel group to ensure free access to the wi-fi as its a little overpriced. Good laundry facilities. Would definitely stay here again.
Visitors beware of the friendly taxi driver in the park along Clarke Quay behind the hotel. He offers to take you to a market and you end up in a back room of a delapidated house full of watches, handbags and purses!!",Trip type: Travelled with family,"Melbourne, Australia",50 ,20 ,4.0,

We booked a club room and were not disappointed, the room was massive with windows to three aspects, good sized bathroom and shower, very comfy beds and good pillows. Well stocked fridge with tea making facilities and a coffee machine that you needed a PhD in something to work, but we got there eventually.

The evening cocktails and canap√©s were very good actually there are most spirits and a couple of choices of beer and red and white wine to choose from, the canap√©s are really very good as well. Local papers and magazines are also available as is free internet and a good Wi-Fi service.

Went out on the first evening for a look around and to find our bearings, the nearest MRT station is literally around the corner from the hotel. When we got back someone had been into our room and turned down our bed left a pair of slippers each side of the bed and left a small chocolate bar on each pillow

Good hint MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) Underground to you and me. A three day Singapore tourist pass costs $S30 about ¬£15 each and can be used on the whole of there MRT system as well as busses, at the end of your three days take your ticket back and get a $S10 refund, so in fact three days worth of travel has just cost you ¬£10 each, the MRT is safe, fast, clean, fun and frantic!!!!!

Breakfast in the main restaurant, I found to be a bit of a lottery, there was so much going on, so many different places to get so many different kinds of food from that we only had breakfast there once, the three other days we used the club lounge.

This is a class hotel with class staff and a slick way of operating, there was some redevelopment work going on while we were there but it did not detract from the overall excellent experience of being in the hotel.

We were not offered any extra tea or coffee after the initial cup. The evening drink and snacks were plentiful but not that good and all served up in a room that resembled a motorway cafe.

Two points I did not like about the room: The air-conditioning was pathetic, even setting it some obscenely low temperature did not cool the room down at all.

Although the hotel is getting a little old and a little worn around the edges in places, it still has great ambience and the service and facilities are first-class. These make up for the decision not to stay in one of the newer hotels. One of the best features is that the hotel is right on the river at Clarke Quay, so you have wonderful access to shops, restaurants, public transport and the great atmosphere of the river precinct - it is great during the day, even better at night. The first time I stayed there, the hotel got my booking a bit mixed up, but were able to correct it without incident. The great thing about it was that when I just mentioned the error, I received a follow-up email from the Manager, apologising for the error - shows they are on the ball and valuing customer feedback.

Date of stay: February 2015,ca920,"Simply the hub of an excellent holiday.  Stay here, enjoy it all.","We stayed for 8 nights at the Swissotel Merchant Court in February for CNY. We reached out before the trip to make sure all our questions were answered and arrived and enjoyed a completely wonderful experience at this superbly comfortable hotel.  From check-in to departure, Mr. Tenius and his staff were personable and outstanding hosts.  So here are a few details that we wanted to highlight:   Our room - clean and comfortable with a Clarke Quay view.  Noise was not an issue and overall comfort was perfect.   The breakfasts - we paid for several days of breakfasts.  These are pretty good and tasty.  The options are many and the staff had a ""can-do"" approach.  For example - my wife asked one of the cooks if there were any hard boiled eggs (as none were seen) for a special diet she had.  well, there was lots of eggs but none hard boiled, however,  within minutes the same cook had swiftly moved to the kitchen and returned with these specifically for my wife.  A wonderful gesture and how he ever found us in all the seating area was amazing.   Anyway - yes breakfast can be expensive, but it is all you can eat!    Staff were very good and friendly.  A few times that we encountered Mr. Rafie at the concierge desk were very helpful and professional.   Another time, one morning around 5am, suffering from jetlag I had an urge to do laundry...  so I staggered down to the front desk to get directions and the required tokens, and much to my amazement, the young lady at the desk who had every reason not to know me, says - ""hello Mr. CXXXX, you are up early,""   How she knew my name is beyond me.  Still, ,..great!      Location: as many of the reviews will say, it is superbly located.  Everywhere is convenient.    Laundry- as mentioned before, Im a laundry geek.  IF you spent time in Singapore and you are a guy, you will sweat.  Rest assured the washing machines and dryers are good, clean and efficient. Yoga - my wife likes yoga and is a decent level at that stuff.  She attended one of the free classes one morning and came back to the room just thrilled with the instructor. Had a great time and learned some new techniques.  This is a wonderful service provided free at the hotel. Pool - we spent some time here.  Its not heated (or at least it was not when we were there) and the layout from the bar is a little difficult to use.  We ordered poolside food and drinks and they were actually pretty good.  Water was cold and probably not for everyone. The Hotel Shop:  I don't think this is technically part of the hotel (its inside the lobby and looks like it is sub-leased).    Anyway, the people in there are friendly and engaging.  They knew me well after a couple of days. Wi-fi and Business office.  Wi-fi all over the hotel was fine.  Also needed to use the business office a few time for printing - even when closed, it was opened up with a friendly smile.  All good. On a final note, I want to pass on our appreciation to Mr. Tenius, the General Manager.   Truly a professional who had time, effort and an engaging manner who left us impressed and very comfortable with any location he ever leads. We are discerning travelers who appreciate a good hotel is the heart of a good holiday.  Thank you to everyone at the Swissotel.

The kids loved the pool which has a big slide in the main pool, a baby pool with a baby slide, and a jacuzzi area.   The room was supposed to be quite spacious about 40sqm, but a lot of space was wasted on the corridor area, thus the room felt smaller. The balcony facing out to Clarke Quay was nice. The age of the property shows especially in the bathroom area with multiple cracks. The bed itself was pretty nice.   Service wise, staff were pretty friendly.

I even left a bag in a taxi and they did all the phoning around to the firm helping me get it back a few hours later. They were just so approachable, kind and friendly not wanting anything for the service they were giving us. Our room during the first stay was spacious and I was most impressed with the bath with the only down side being that the water took AGES to heat up. Our rooms were clean and we arrived with our luggage waiting and the zed bed fully prepared.

We were given complimentary water and endlessly being asked if there was anything staff could do to assist us.

I must say that the rooms look smaller than in the pictures I see on the Swissotel website.

But overall, there was nothing to complain about regarding the hotel -- it is clean, the rooms are quite well furnished, wifi was fast.

My booking was for an executive floor room and I was assigned a room on the same floor as the lounge. How convenient! I only managed to drop by the lounge on the evening I arrived though. It was filled with guests and the team members were helpful and non-intrusive. The food laid out on the buffet counter was typical of any club floor lounge, not too filling but yet enticing. After all, there is a reason they call it evening cocktails, not dinner.

Now for the hitch! Wanting to ask for an extended checkout time proofed to be quite a challenge for a male team member. He out rightly refused to accord me the late checkout and when I asked that he at least check, he said bluntly that he knew what the occupancy was the day after. I would rather he take the time to go through the motion of checking and even if the answer was going to be negative, at least there was an attempt to do so.

Date of stay: August 2014,Sun H,Very bad hotel,"We stayed there for 2 nights in august.

We had booked our stay for 3 nights in another hotel in SIngapore, but since we changed our plans during our trip through Asia, we finally came 2 days earlier in SIngapore, and booked this hotel for those first 2 nights. I regret it deeply !!

The hotel is very expensive for what it is, even for SIngapore's high prices. It probably was a good hotel in the 1980-90's, but it's not anymore !

Positives:
- Very nice swimming pool area, makes you feel you're in a tropical island, even though you're in the heart of a city.
- Free wifi

Negatives:
- Very old and dirty rooms
- Curtains both in the room and in the shower had stains everywhere
- Blood stain in the bed when we arrived (they changed it quickly)
- Shower has absolutely no pressure...
- The central control device for the room wasn't working. Every time we reduced the A/C fan speed the bathroom's light turned on !! Very weird.
- Not enough people in reception...had to queue for a while duing check-in and check-out

Overall it's an awful hotel at these prices (might be decent at half the price or less). There are much better hotels in Singapore for the same price, and just paying 10% more you can get luxury 5 stars.
Its incredibly over priced, considering the rooms are falling apart. The location is very good for night life.

Date of stay: September 2014,Peter H,Avoid like the plague!,"This hotel is a disaster. I travel the world on business and can't remember the last time I stayed in such a poor establishment. From the outside it looks great, but there has been no investment on the interior and the rooms in particular are in poor condition. I stayed in a Club floor room and was seriously underwhelmed as I walked in the door. The fittings are old and the carpet was badly stained. The bathroom is ancient, and you have to stand in the mouldy and chipped bath for a shower. The drains are clogged and take ages to empty the sink and bath water. When you have a shower, the water pours out onto the floor and soaks the bathmat. The maid couldn't even be bothered to replace the shower gel, instead standing the empty container next to my shampoo and putting an additional body lotion in the rack. Just what I needed!
The rooms themselves suffer from thin walls so I was clearly able to hear the couple next door having a good time, and the other side had a baby that cried, so I'm afraid not once in my 3 nights there did I get a good nights sleep. Totally unacceptable in a premium room on a premium floor in a supposedly quality hotel.
On my first night I returned to the hotel and decided to have a couple of beers before going to bed. It was Saturday and the hotel claims in its directory that the bar is open until 1.00am. Not so I'm afraid, it closed about 12.20 and told guests turning up to go outside to the other bar. Probably just as well as the beer is an eye-watering ¬£12 a pint. It's certainly cheaper in the close by bars in Clarke Quay.
What particularly annoyed me was the managements attitude to an unattractive prostitute who was accosting every male in the bar on the Sunday night, offering her professional services. Three times the bar staff called Security, and three times nothing happened. One of the girls said if I made a fuss and complained to the Duty Manager something may happen. I went to bed instead.....on my own.
Last but not least, my room TV worked intermittently and the reception on both CNN and the BBC is poor. Also, the wireless drops out regularly.
When I checked out the receptionist was totally disinterested in any comment I had, so I decided to depart, write my review, and never darken their doorstep again. If you've read this review in full and got to this point, you have been warned. If you go ahead and book this hotel, then don't say you weren't warned.

To get a taxi after 10 a.m. you may have to walk out to the main road‚Ä¶as I experienced the bell hops were completely ignored when waving for taxis pulling in for the Central shopping mall on the other side of the entrance. (I waited for 10 minutes once, but got one on the main road after 30 seconds) To be sure you get a nice and early sleep you should prevent to have a room too close to the riverside! I had that once and the overall Clark Quay noise (people and some music) until 4:30 in the morning was difficult. That's of cause nothing to blame the hotel for, but I think it's good to know.

For foodies, Boat Quay is just a throw away where there are heaps of restuarants & pubs along SIngapore river. Central is a shopping centre where you can grab local breeky.

Chinatown is just a short walk where you can enjoy a good foot massage and FOODs :). Shopping there is not wise unless you have a local friend to bring you around. Locals shop at this shop called ""Ocean"" in chinatown for big brands fragances, comestics at GOOD price (Real stuff not fake) and daily personal shower, body and hair products.

Ask any local and they will agree -- Singaporeans are bad at providing good service. It's just not part of the culture. Hotel staff are rather cold, and certainly do not go out of their way to help you or to expedite anything. And, surprisingly, for a country that is supposed to have English as an official language, some of the hotel staff could not understand basic requests.

The Merchant Court is situated on Clarke Quay along the Singapore river. Just step outside the door for a myriad of bars, restaurants, shops & the subway. Chinatown is close by too.

This large hotel has over 400 rooms yet service is excellent. We stayed here twice on the route to and from a holiday in New Zealand. There is also a lovely pool area.

We had 'classic rooms'.The first room on the 2nd floor had a great view over Clarke quay & was spacious. It was decorated in a traditional style & maybe was a liitle in need of updating. The 2nd visit we were on the 6th floor- a big room on a corner-much more modern in style. The only downside was zero view (wall or car park). Still, we didn't spend too much time looking out of the windows!

The buffet breakfast was excellent-plenty of choice in a pleasant dining area. At around $30 it was worth it.

Date of stay: March 2014,sirtravel,depends on the price,"Stayed here for a couple of nights at the bargain rate of SGD 180 excluding breakfast and my review is based on this price.  If I was charged the normal rate that is twice what I paid, I would give this 3* at best.Check in was efficient and I was upgraded to a better than standard room.  The bedding was VERY comfortable and they gave you a ""pillow menu"" to choose pillows to accommodate different needs -- very nice.  The room was large and everything was in perfect working order.  Nice touches like bathrobes, free shoeshine, and free internet if you join the Swissotel loyalty club (which is free).  The location could not be better -- right at Clarks Quay and a short walk to Chinatown but it is a bit of a touristy area and there seems to be lots of people from cruise ships staying at the hotel.  They have a decent gym that is hardly used and a nice pool area with a separate pool for kids.  Actually would be a nice hotel for families but I was traveling solo.    I paid for the breakfast buffet one morning (SGD 33 + taxes) and it was just OK but can't compare to those offered at 5* hotels like the Shangri-La.  While the offerings were better than average, the quality was only average and I chose not to pay for breakfast the second day but went across the street to Ya Kun Kaya Toast for some kaya toast and coffee for SGD 4 -- a much better and tastier option.

Food and beverages are also expensive. The breakfast at SG$32 per person is nothing short of daylight robbery. I'm sure I saw Dick Turpin having breakfast there (didn't see his horse). The room mini bar was charging SG$12 for a small can of Tiger beer. So be warned.
The location of the Hotel next to Clake Quay MRT is excellent, also all the action is close at hand. There is some lovely walks up the Singapore river.

Also from a service perspective whilst we got everything we needed the service was not proactive, no member of staff acknowledged or spoke to us without us approaching them, when we left we were not even asked if we had enjoyed our stay by the Receptionist.

Date of stay: January 2014,TOl3,Very good value,"I recently stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court with my husband and three children for four nights. We had an extremely enjoyable stay, and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

I had requested adjoining rooms when I made the booking. Although this wasn't possible at the time, we were give two rooms next to each other, which was fine. Just as I've found at other Swissotel hotels, the rooms at the Merchant Court were spacious, compared to so many other hotels, and we were comfortably accommodated. Some of the fixtures, such as the light fittings, were a bit worn and tired. However, the beds were comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were clean.

Outside the rooms, the hotel facilities were very good. My kids loved the pool and water slide. I thought the slide was a little bit dirty (hotel management appreciated this feedback and assured me they'd investigate), but it didn't worry my kids.

We all enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning, and found it good value. Breakfast was not included in our package. However, when I checked in I was offered a good deal (one free child per paying adult), which I accepted.

I agree with other hotel reviewers on Trip Advisor who claim Wi-fi should not be an optional extra these days, but included in all accommodation packages. By joining the Swissotel Circle Club, we were given access to free Wi-fi, which we found useful.

The hotel's location was fantastic, and one of the reasons we stayed there. It's right in the heart of Clarke Quay, by the river. This made eating out each evening easy, as there was a variety of restaurants on our door step. In addition, Chinatown was an easy five minute walk one way, and Orchard Road was a 15 minute walk the other way (but with taxis as cheap as they are in Singapore, we walked to Orchard Road just once). The hotel is also metres away from an MTR station.

There are some amazing accommodation options in Singapore, which can make choosing a hotel daunting.

We also had some drinks riverside at the Swissotel bar which was nice (although you pay for the privilege the view and setting, including a great soundtrack are worth it).One minor point of confusion though is we booked online with Swissotel and flew Singapore Airlines.  I was under the impression that we would receive free breakfast as we were SIA customers.  However, when asking about this I was told because we booked online we were not.  While not a big issue it was annoying as I thought we would receive the offer and there was no real indication as to why we were not eligible.

Considering my preggy wife, who is not allow to travel overseas anymore, and 30m DD, thus, decided to get a room to stay overnight and not travel home (ya, ya, ya.. Singapore is small.. haa..)

The hotel is situated next to Singapore River, next to Clark Quay, next to Central mall, next to Clark Quay MRT station (and many more), it is a superb location just to get you (tourist) covered on:
1. Singapore sceneries by boat at the Singapore River.
2. Entertainment at Clark Quay
3. Shopping Experience at Central Mall
4. Travelling to other parts of Singapore by MRT

We arrived at about 11am. Greeted by friendly staffs. But not ready to check-in as the room needs to be cleaned. We were advised to go for our lunch first and promised that the room will be ready when we are back. We went for our lunch at Central mall. And as promised, room was ready.

We booked one of the Swiss Advantage Room. We were 'greeted' by a mini bar at the front after opening the door. The bathroom is just by the side and, further in, is the bed with the glass-top writing desk at one corner. The room is clean (probably just cleaned). and the room is very spacious (for my hyperactive DD to 'monkey' around).

We rest for awhile before making our way to the swimming pool. I would say the pool size is great, but there isn't sufficient pool-side chairs. There are a Jacuzzi pool and a children pool. There are slides for the main pool and the children pool. We did not enjoy a single moment in any of the pool though. Yeah, its very windy, the water is cold and afraid my DD will fail sick after this. We decided not to proceed. (CNY is just around the corner).

We attended our friend's wedding banquet at Merchant Court Ballroom. I would say the food served was pretty good. Don't think you can find the equivalent from Blue Potato, Ellenborough Market Cafe or Crossroad Bar.

Went back to room after the banquet. The mattress is firm with 2 normal (rectangular) pillows and 2 large square pillows. The normal pillow is towards firm and the square pillows are much softer. You can decide how you want to enjoy your sleep.

You are close to Clarke  Quay, but that place is over hyped because everything there is over priced.   Overall, I would recommend another hotel.

Our only comment would be that the breakfast is very expensive  - or appeared so to us - we therefore went out locally for it [and there is a lot of competition] much as we would have liked to eat in the hotel.  We had stayed here twice before and breakfast had been included in the room price - so we did not need to make a choice - a cheaper room on floors 2-4 - but then we only had a view of an office block and the room was dark.

At 10:00am we were able to use our room.  The room was well sized, with 2 queen size beds, and a very spacious bathroom.  More than enough space for the three of us.The hotel is located in Clarke Quay, and overlooks the river.  Just across the road is the Central shopping centre. We used the taxis to get around, as they are cheap and quick.The buffet in the Ellenborough Cafe is exceptional, if a little pricey.  We also ate in Chinatown, which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel, and in Central shopping centre, where a large number of authentic Singaporean eateries are located.After checking out at noon on our last day (our flight was at midnight that night), we were once again invited to leave our luggage with the concierge, and relax by the pool, have a shower, and only leave when we wanted to.  We were hugely impressed with the service levels we experienced during our stay, and without exception, every single member of the hotel staff that we interacted with made us feel both welcome and special.

Our first trip to Singapore and we wanted to see and do as much as possible in our 5 day stay and from this hotel getting everywhere was a breeze! MRT in flash shopping complex next door (MRT is the most amazing, safe and easy way to get around Singapore), Clarke quay on your back doorstep (no roads to cross), river boats that can get you out to Marina bay sands or the flyer for something different, china town 5 minute walk away for fun shopping, eye opening stores and Hawker food stores.

If you are a keen shopper and only have time to do orchard road, you may be disappointed. A trip down this road on the hop on hop off bus, was sufficient for our needs, and as a budget traveller, being closer to china town was more convenient. The MRT gets you there quickly if you had expensive shopping on your itinery.

The concierge were amazing, they treated us as though they were our private travel agents and made getting to the zoo, universal studious etc a breeze.

Some may say the rooms are dated ( probably 'grand' 30 years ago) We thought they were incredibly roomy and comfortable. We had a pleasant view of the pool and limited view of Clarke quay.

Breakfast was amazing in the downstairs buffet, and the staff were incredibly efficient. Every taste was catered for.

We had only one hick up with our stay and that was due to poor communication over their billing policy, which caused a little bit of panic on the first day of our holiday. Fortunately everything went smoothly after this.

Only one complaint. Pillows were very large and hard (we are used to smaller pillows)

Anyway on arrival to the Swissotel Merchant I was taken to the club floor as I had an Executive room with club benefits, I am new to the club benefit thing and from now on all rooms will have club due to the benefits and service however, price will determines this at any property. I did request this room type because they have a balcony and I am a smoker, I was travelling with another male companion (twin) and on arrival I found that I didn‚Äôt have my balcony as these rooms are king bedded only to my disappointment‚Ä¶ they did offer me another room the following day but I was only there for 36hrs as I had an early flight so I denied the offer!

The club room has great views over looking Singapore Creek and Marina Bay Sands in the back ground, the food was awesome and the menu was changed daily. Additional club benefits at this property is the happy hour 6-8pm that is free drinks including spirits and I couldn‚Äôt help myself free pouring larger than average shots, other properties I have stayed in with club access normally charge a fortune for a tasty beverage.

Rooms were spacious, large bathroom and lots of little extras within the room being a Executive room which made a nice touch as a souvenir hunter.

Service was exceptional, everyone was polite and the room was serviced to perfection.

Added benefit of this property is you can walk right out the front door, turn left and you are into the realm of Clarke Quay where all the restaurants and clubs are, noting that pints of larger in Singapore are not cheap at $17 SGD ‚Ä¶ expensive!

Our room 309 was very small with hardly enough room to open our two suitcases without using the bed. The carpet was dirty and needed renewing. The bathroom has been decorated recently but the quality of the grouting is poor. Our air conditioning did not work and I found that there is no free wifi. I complained at reception in person about the room size, the air-con, no free wifi and a lack of sun beds at the pool. The reception staff are happy to listen but unwilling to do anything apart from sending a maintenance man to fix the air-con. They say all the right things parrot-fashion but robots could do as good a job. There is a blond girl, who I assumed is a trainee, hovering in the background. She needs to learn to smile as she gives off a very frosty air. This was my first visit to Singore and I know it's an expensive city but I would actually rather pay more for a better standard of hotel and more receptive staff. The exception is Mr Albert Koh the head concierge and his team. Mr Koh offered help before and during my stay and I cannot praise him enough. The bar staff were also pleasant.

They told me that they had no standard room anymore and they could only offer me a room at 570 SGD. When I told them that I would not accept and cancel the whole booking, suddenly they had a standard room left for which they obliged me to pay 370 SGD. You have to know that at the reception they have a sign standing telling that they employees will serve you honestly and friendly. Which was for sure not the case!
I travel to Singapore every month and know a lot of hotels and prices in Singapore. 260 SGD is already an exaggerated pricing, 370SGD is a rip off, knowing that the standard rooms are old and not super clean. There were even tubes forgotten in the bathroom after repairing done.

While I've stayed at more superior and luxurious hotels in this bustling Asian dynamo, it's hard to beat the convienence of walking to literally hundreds of restaurants, bars and shops. That being said, the hotel seemed to cater to a touristy clientele and the construction of the room revealed some defects (cracked tiles, poor grouting, etc.)

The hotel provided me a room located close to the elevators and with a drab view of another buitlding; a bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, the room itself was adequate (above average) with a comfortable bed, a work desk and a decent size bathroom. I liked the fact that the room provided an in-room safe as well as expresso coffee maker. The wireless internet worked well in the room.

I ordered room service once. While I had to wait on the phone for 5 minutes before someone took my order, the order itself was delivered very promptly, including a toaster that insured that my toast was warm.

Date of stay: November 2012,Rosie-holidaylover,"Great location & friendly, caring staff","A number of friends recommended this hotel and the trip advisor reviews confirmed that it was worth giving it a try. We have stayed in Singapore a few times over recent years and this hotel was definitely the best.
We had booked a classic room with a pool view and unfortunately that wasn't available when we checked in on the Friday night, but we were moved to the other side of the hotel on the Sunday afternoon, so it wasn't a real inconvenience (we were there for 9 nights). As a compensation for the move, the hotel provided us with a small fruit platter.
I would definitely advise going for a pool view room (we also had a view over the river from room 401 although this was directly adjacent to the lifts and we did hear some guest traffice noise).
Our room was very comfortable with a relatively biggish bathroom with a bath; a massive, very comfortable bed; and wonderful black out curtains that allowed us to sleep in. The only problem with the room was there was only one bed-side table. The tiling grout in the bathroom did look a bit amateurish, but it wasn't too bad. The hotel lobby is not as grand as many you'll find, but it's attractive enough.
We didn't have a lot to do with the staff as we didn't eat any meals in the hotel, but they were all very attentive and pleasant and they made a big fuss of me for my birthday which was such a lovely touch and really appreciated (ie a little cake, bottle of wine and chocolates).
My husband said the gym was the best he's ever experience in a hotel.
The pool is great, however there are probably not enough loungers for the size of the hotel.
There's lots to do around the hotel with all the Clarke Quay attractions, although it's a bit too touristy for our liking. Across the road is the Central Shopping Mall and the basement food court has heaps of really good little food stalls for a quick bite.
We bought local SIMS and used these for web access.

The hotel is situated right next to Clarke Quay so it's the best place to stay if you're going to enjoy a Saturday night out. It's also 2 minutes away from the MRT (the Singapore Subway) which is excellent for exploring the city.
The service from the hotel staff was really good, they were patient and helpful and we got everything done on time and to our liking - printing our flight boarding passes, getting suggestions and directions around the island, getting a taxi, getting our luggage to/from our room, getting help with the internet connection, etc.
Our room was quite spacious (and not only by Singapore standards), very clean and comfortable and the only trouble we had was finding the switch to turn the air-conditioning off. It eventually turned out to be part of a group of switches placed very comfortably on my night stand together with switches for all the lights in the room.
Breakfast was very good, but not ""absolutely spectacular"", or at least that was our impression after coming from a 5* week in Bali. The option to have your breakfast next to the quay is a very nice touch though.

In October 2011 we visited for a 14 day stay and were looking for a nice hotel, with a good price-quality ratio. The sad fact is that Singapore hotel prices are going through the roof (or our Euro is losing its value like crazy) and even 3 star hotels charge ridiculous prices for their rooms. After comparing prices, the Swissotel came out on top, with a nice long term stay rate.   After arriving, our room turned out to be a very small one, even though we were staying with four persons in one room. The room was on the first floor and, like the property, a bit dated.

Perfectly located on buzzy Clarke Quay, there are loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep and the financial district within easy walking distance.The relaxed holiday-vibe at the palm-fringed poolside bar was great for unwinding after a long day in the office.

I stayed in an Business Advantage room - loved starting the day with an espresso from the machine in room, also really appreciated the complimentary bottles of water, and not having to ask for an iron and ironing board. The big safe fitted by laptop and iPad, free WiFi was really appreciated as I have these and an iPhone all requiring web access. Also having an the on-site launderette was genius as I do have an unconventional dislike of hotel laundry services. The Executive Lounge was a big bonus, their breakfast selection was really good and the happy hour complimentary drinks and nibbles certainly saved a few dollars in expensive Singapore.

We chose this hotel because of the Kids Room Special and the look of the pool set-up.   Overall we were really pleased with Swissotel Merchant Court.  The airport transfer the hotel organized was excellent.  Check-in was fast, efficient and polite.  The kids loved their special packs.  The rooms were very good, particularly the adjoining kid's room and the set up was just what we were wanting. The location was fantastic and right next to the MRT, shopping mall across the road and all the restaurants of Clarke Quay on the doorstep. In terms of positives and negatives.... it is not cheap, particularly drinks round the pool.  The breakfast buffet was fairly average and on some days was crazy busy.  The bathrooms were fairly tired.  But on the positive side, the pool area was great and the kids spent every afternoon in the pool and on the slides. The gym was good.  Everywhere in the hotel is clean and tidy and the rooms were always cleaned very well. The kids were always welcome everywhere in the hotel and were greeted with smiles wherever we went. The location is fantastic and having the MRT right on the doorstop made getting everywhere a breeze.   I would definitely recommend the Swissotel Merchant Court for families wanting a good base.  We weren't sure whether we'd get too bored having ten full days in Singapore but we had loads to do and were able to enjoy a 'pool' holiday as well.

Buffet - the hotel buffet looks tempting, but I recommend the Japanese buffet in the Central plaza across the road (go to the far side of the building). At lunchtime, it will set you back about $20 for a diverse buffet including soft drinks. The 'special' rate at Ellenborough Market Cafe was $38 for lunch and $48 for dinner.

Date of stay: September 2011,Cecilia L,Great Place to Stay by the riverside,My husband and I visited Singapore 4 times last year for business and pleasure. We tried 4 different hotels and so far Swissotel never fails to deliver. We already stayed in Swissotel Stamford in 2010 and it was a wonderful experience so we decided to try Merchant Court.  we were billeted in their executive floor and our room was overlooking the river opposite Clarke Quay.  The place is rather romantic because of the interior architectural design and the al fresco for breakfast or lunch near the river. Love to just sit there and let time passes by. The staff are all efficient and very accommodating. They are proficient in English so no problem communicating. It is across Clarke Quay so we had a wonderful night life and dining experience.

The lobby looks very smart indeed but don't be fooled, the rooms are not up to the same standard at the moment. My room was rather small and tired, the bathroom was average and needed updating, the TV was spectacularly ancient, rather a unique experience for a hotel in Asia so basically, to sum it up, the rooms need a total renovation.

However, drinks in the bar/cafe were extortionate. A cup of coffee was the equivalent of ¬£4.50p, and a can of diet coke ¬£4.75p. Some of this is down to the local taxes. I.e. 10% Service charge added to the bill, and then a further 7% Government tax on top. Effectively this means that the price advertised for goods is always inflated by a further 17% in service charges and taxes.

I booked a kids deal which is two rooms with an interconnecting door for 5 nights.  I paid a lot of money to stay here and should not have had any of the following problems.  The story goes like this.  Check in was smooth and we proceeded to our rooms.  No sooner had we arrived at our rooms our doorbell went.  A friendly woman walked in to welcome us to the hotel and provided the kids with a soft toy each.  We also were provided with fresh fruit and chocolates.  We instantly felt really welcome.  So, why do you ask were we bitterly disappointed!  Well, whether we had old rooms or not, the air conditioning didn't work and in Singapore you don't want the air conditioning not working (we must say that this did get rectified).  Our mini bar did not work and was not fixed prior to us leaving. With the double bed there was only one bed side table so too bad if you were both relaxing on the bed drinking a coffee, you had no where to put it, nor your book if you read at night etc.  We had ants in the room and they never seemed to be attended too. There was no where to put your suitcase without having to step over it to get anywhere.  This isn't to say that the room was small, just nowhere to put it ‚Äì more of a poor design.  The kids room was organised with a Wii which was fantastic.  However if you wanted to watch the TV after you finished with the Wii, you had to call the technicians to come and change the plugs around as the TV was so old you were unable to switch to either format.  No, we were unable to change the plugs around ourselves as you had to take the top of the unit, in which the TV sat in, off ‚Äì tools we did not have.  Also, and really only a small aesthetic problem, however with all the other problems and this being a four star hotel, the bathroom was appalling.  I‚Äôm sure a blind man put the grout in.  It was all over the tiles; big slabs of grout between each tile.  It looked poor.  The room was outdated and not modern as per their advertising.  The only redeeming thing with this hotel is its location and friendly staff.  The room; for the price I paid I expected a lot more.

We called housekeeping and got a call back from the duty manager. He first suggested fixing the tap TOMORROW - lol, he could easily see that we only just checked in and without a shower how could we possibly go to bed not to mention we had a 4yo kid!!

After we saying NO, we were moved to another room on 5th floor - same type of room but a lot smaller which was fine as we now could have a decent hot shower at least.

Have to say the bed linen is so so nice. I normally don't notice this kind of things but this time I felt so luxury when laying on the bed. They were just soft. They also had a ""pillow menu"" so you can request different type of pillow to suit your personal needs. We didn't use it though.

We didn't use their service much but reception staff seem friendly. We used the pool once at night time, it was not bad. Daily breakfast in Executive Club on 11th floor - small selections but nothing to complain about.

Getting to the hotel was easy, you can drop at Clarke Quay MRT and walk to the hotel and it's surrounded by good restaurants, club, bars and malls. Checking-in was quite ok, the receptionist was welcoming. The only downside was that our room wasn't ready until 3pm although we've specifically requested for an early check-in at 1pm when we did the reservation. We were given complimentary drinks though, so we headed to the lounge to wait.   Here's something that I've encountered which i think the staff needs to improve on.

Date of stay: October 2011,confusedtraveller2,not much to complain about,The hotel is by the river opposite clarke quay which has a very wide selection of bars and restaurants. We almost had too much choice of places to eat! The hotel rooms are a little dated but on the whole spacious and comfortable. The highest floor we could have was on the second floor and the view was poor. Lovely pool with plenty of beds. The main downside of the hotel was the staff on the desk. Initially after a long wait we checked into room 221 went up to the room and let ourselves into a room where other people were already in the room. Not very good for security! After another long wait we finally checked into 211. Checking out also seemed to take quite a while.  My husband had a massage in the spa which he enjoyed and would recommend reasonably priced also.

From the hotel you have a very easy access to all restaurants and bars in Clarke Quay and to the spotless MRT. However, the hotel is starting to show its age. On our different visits we mainly stayed in the classic room and tried once the Swiss business advantage room. The price difference is not worth.

The rooms were confortable (a touch on the noisy side though) and the breakfast was generous.Try and get a hotel package with access to the ""executive lounge"" (or whatever they call it) as this is definitely value for money. Here you can drink as much as you like of anything (there is also finger-food available but we chose to save our apetite for Chinatown which is just down the road).

Date of stay: September 2011,Granty66,Good location............but not much else going for it!,"We had a 4 night stay at the Swissotel (wife, daughter and me).

After booking a trip to the Far East with Trailfinders, we were slightly apprehensive after seeing some of the comments on tripadvisor. After arriving we thought the comments were against the wrong hotel.

Unfortunately we started to see where some of the previous comments wer coming from.

At breakfast it was feast or famine! Lots of stuff or very little. One day you had a member of staff trying to top your coffee up every two minutes whilst the next you had to demand a cup of coffee. The ready made omlette I had was the worst ever and ensured that i never tried that option again on following mornings.

Our towels appeard to get thinner by the day. On our final day (1st October) the towels were very thin - someone else posted this comment previously.

We were hoping for a long lie on our final day as our flight was not till 1am on the following morning. Unfortunately we were awoken at 7.30 with loud music being tested for a wedding that was taking place that morning. It would have been nice to have been given advance notice of this.

I tried to extend the room from the normal noon check out. At first I was told that we could keep it till 2pm for no charge. Up until 6pm was 100$$ and then it would be the full room rate. When I returned 5 minutes later ( to go for the 6pm option) I was told that we could only keep it till 1pm as the hotel was now going to be very busy. This basically summed up the hotel for me, initial impression is good when you arrive but thereafter it is a downward spiral.

When we checked out I was given an unexpected shock. Despite being told by Trailfinders that breakfasts were included at all my hotels on out tour, I was charged for breakfast! When we checked in I was told by the front desk that everything was prepaid and then told that you get your breakfast over there - no mention of additional cost.At ¬£25 each per day it was a big additional bill - when I queried it I was told that breakfast was not included. After I fight I managed to get them to only charge for 3 days. They never actually backed down because we did not go for breakfast on our final day and still wanted to charge me unless I signed some paper to say that we did not have breakfast and if this was incorrect I would be liable for the cost. Had we known that breakfast was not included we would not have bothered getting up for it as it was pretty poor and I'm sure that subway or something else at the central mrket (opposite the hotel) would have served up something of a higher quality at a fraction of the price.

There is no free internet access or wifi in the hotel. At 10$$ an hour it is very expensive. When the local buses in my own city offer free wifi I fail to see why a hotel charges so much!

Considering that many guests must have onward flights in the early hours we were extremely disappointed with the facilities once you have checked out. You cannot even sit by the pool as anything above lobby level requires as room key to access the lift to access these areas. The only sitting areas available are a bar where the staff keep askign you to buy a drink or another area that was taken over by the wedding guests on our departure date!

I would question if this hotel is 4*. In my view it is a tired 3*.

This was the poorest overall hotel we stayed in during our tour. I went to our local Trailfinders Office yesterday to register my disappoint with this hotel. It was not my first pick but I was talked into going there by the trailfinders rep.

The positve - the hotel is well located.

Personally when I go back to Singapore I will be looking for an alternative hotel. In all our years of travelling in the Far East, this was our worst hotel experience.

If you are going to Singapore you must go for afternoon tea at Raffles Hotel (you need to book) as it is a memorable experience and they know the meaning of the word service!

I was told I could upgrade the next day to a room with a balcony for SG$40 per night - which I accepted. However, I didn't end up moving - the room on level 4 (room 455) was a large room - a little outdoated and the carpet a little stained, but I'd unpacked by then and couldn't be bothered moving.

Date of stay: September 2011,Renee L,It USED TO BE good... Service is so Terrible now!!,"I chose Swissotel cos my friend who is going for the stay with me strongly recommended it; saying that she was impressed with the service the last time she was there... But... the experience with their services got me so upset that I woke up at 0430am feeling totally angry and disturbed; I had to write to this feedback email.I have initially decided to overlook the minor service lags encountered, but due to the experience the night before, I decided to list down every single detail of my observation. The Ultimatum On the 29 Sep, at approximately 1050pm, we dialed the In-room dining ext to check if the ""Nasi Goreng"" in the menu is still available.  The reply was ""Let me check with the chef and get back to you"".  At approximately 11.15pm, since there was no return call, so we dialed in to check again, the response was ""Oh yes, the order is on the way"".  When the food arrives, the served items does not coincide with what is indicated in the menu (without otah, curry vege and chicken wings), so we called to check.  Before I could finish my sentence, Linda on the other line, interrupted me and spoke in a extremely harsh tone ""Mdm! When you called, the item is already not available so this is the best our chef can do for you at this time!""  After being told off, I finally get to asked why were we not informed? And in the first place, we called in to check availability but no one got back to us until we made the 2nd call.  Taken aback, Linda rudely says "" Wait!..."" turning to her colleagues in the background.. ""Eh.. You all never inform...""  A good 3min later, with a changed tone, she admitted the mistake, claiming that she just took over shift and was not aware that we were not informed of the changes.. and asked ""so you do not want the Nasi Goreng is it?""  The reason I attempted to make an order is obviously because I was hungry! And to take back the food to solve the problem??!!! What kind of response is that?!!! I have to tell her the obvious and that I wanted to lodge this encounter with somebody. Only upon this, that she reverted and says that she will check with the kitchen staff and sees what they can offer.  Ok, the kitchen staff responded in an apologetic manner and offer to waive off the charges for the meal.  But I have been scolded and accused of being unreasonable, treated in harsh manner, just because a staff took over shift without getting her facts right plus the negligence down the line of service chains?!!  No amount of apologies nor food shuffed down my throat can make me swallow the displeasures!  It's like you punched someone in the face and says sorry got the wrong person??!!! The Front Desk could not ""hear"" us! My friend checked in on my behalf and was informed that I need to approach the counter to sign some documents when I arrived.  I was not feeling well, when I reached the front desk and my friend tried to inform the staff that we are here to complete the check in, again, before she could finish her sentence, the staff says ""oh.. let me go get it"" and come back with something else.. I had to stand in my mildly sedated state for quite a while to wait for the staff to grasp the situation and get the procedures done! We were told to approach the frontdesk for complimentary parking tickets whenever we need to drive out of the hotel; the following day, for the complimentary parking tickets, we had to repeat each of our names 3 times but still not heard!! Only when the staff finally gets into the system, to read the same names we repeated so many times.  She was simply not listening to us, just going through motion when asked us to give our names! What's wrong with the staff??? ""Going through motion"" or Stereo-typing? From observation, it seems like a service policy for staffs in Merchant Court to greet guests when sees them.  So, I received a ""Good Evening"", from a figure who glance at me and turned the other direction in the midst of the greeting, who to ""flank"" but only to meet me at the lift lobby again, pretended that I was invisible looking at all other directions.  I think a kid has better manners. When we returned to our room after breakfast, seeing that the house-keeping is at work, we decided to wait at the lobby rest area.  There were foreign guests at the same area, a service personnel in suit came forward to greet the other foreign guests.  He glanced at us from the corner of his eyes and made a 360degree turn and walked off.  Do you have to be so obvious?! That we are not priviledge guests??!!! Incomplete amenities I have heard and experienced from my overseas work-trips that some hotel staffs deliberately provide incomplete set of amenities so that there would be opportunities for tips when guests made requests.  I did not expect this to happen in Singapore.  We did not have complete tolilet amenities nor receive the daily papers until we call.. I hope this is an coincidence.

The rest of our three night stay there was great and the staff were so so helpful. Unbelievably good sleeps; you do not hear anything outside your room!

Rooms:
tatty,smelly,peeling paint off walls,musty dirty carpets that are totally worn out,terrible decor.The TV was from the 70's!
Bathroom outdated,dirty,with ants!,tiles from the 50's!,awful shower and sticky floor in bath!...not even cleaned properly. The towels are limited and the thinnest I've ever come across!
Service was terrible all round: reception staff are rude & disinterested;at breakfast you might as well be invisible...the waiters are totally unattentive...had to ask 3 different waiters for a cup of tea...then it came without milk! Food at buffet was awful: fruit was stale,limited pastry & cereal choices,my husband found hair in fruit!
Room service was none the better...waited 1 1/2 hours for a meal that then came incomplete!

Although we got upgraded from a classic to an advantage room ( which is much better,but bathroom still really dated), the overall poor attitude of disinterested staff did not improve our experience.

This one does indeed have a terrific location. Clarke Quay is great for walking around at night. And the little ice cream van outside by the river is a must.

Our room was clean and comfortable, to the standard you'd expect for the star quality.

Service at check-in was outstanding. We were checked in by Pearce who was exceedingly polite and helpful. He was so charming we were persuaded to upgrade to a club room! This meant wifi, breakfast and evening drinks/snacks were included. These extras were all very enjoyable. Breakfast was one of the best I've had - extensive, quality buffet. And the evening drinks were too good - sitting up on a high floor by the big windows with a view of the ship-on-two-skyscrapers was great. The staff were just too eager to keep re-filling our wine glasses. This was good in a country notorious for expensive alcohol. The upgrade was not cheap, but we enjoyed ourselves!

We liked the bar area downstairs, where we hung around a bit before going to the airport to leave. We bought some nice wine which we enjoyed with complimentary newspapers, crisps and some other little snacks.

Check-in was fast and the person we dealt with was very pleasant. We went up to our room and by the time we had opened the door and put our hand luggage down the porter was at the door with our cases.

As some others have stated the rooms are probably due for renovation but this in no way affected the functionality. Our room was always clean and fresh. The TV was small and old but it worked perfectly well. The bathroom was good and had excellent lighting. Our safe didn't work properly at first but after a call to reception a man arrived within 10 mins to fix it. The paperwork in our room stated that the external painting of the hotel will be finished in early July. We were also told that they are working their way through the floors renovating rooms. Either way there was no noise or inconvenience to us.

The public areas are very nice and the pool was lovely to come back to after a hot day sightseeing or shopping.

The breakfast was great and you could sit inside or outside overlooking the river. We had the buffet one evening and thought it was good value (lots of seafood). Most evenings we requested ice to be brought up to our room and it was there within 10 mins.

The hotel is in a very good position. The MRT is in the basement of the Central Shopping Centre across the road. Chinatown is a 5 minute walk down the road. On the riverside of the hotel you have everything from Brewerkz and the famous Jumbo restaurant to the left, Boat Quay to the right and Clarke Quay directly in front across the river.

We booked a double room, but upon check in they had none available so we were given a twin room instead. The twin room was huge, about twice the size of the normal double classic rooms. It needed some modernising, the TV was an old CRT model, and there was some wallpaper peeling off next to one of the beds, but this is minor to me considering the amount of time I spend in the room. There was an in-room safe, iron and ironing board, hairdryer and the bathroom had some basic toiletries. There were tea and coffee making facilities and we got two complimentary bottles of water every day. Unlike the Business Advantage rooms, no bathrobe and slippers, but no big deal.
There are a few things I love about the SMC - the breakfast in the Ellenbrough Market Cafe is one of them. It's a buffet style breakfast with a nice choice of Asian and Western foods; eggs, bacon/ham, beans, hash browns, dim sum, congee, smoked salmon, cooked meats, cheeses, breads, fruit. Another thing I like is the pool, it's a nice large pool with a decent depth and waterfalls at one side. There's also a jacuzzi and a good number of sun loungers.
The best thing though is the location. Turn right out of the hotel entrance and you'll come to Exit B of Clarke Quay MRT station, where you can easily access Chinatown or Dhoby Ghaut interchange. Across the road is the Central Mall, which has some nice shops and some good restaurants. Or just beyond that and over the bridge is Clarke Quay itself, with lots of nice restaurants and bars. Look on the Clarke Quay website for details of the happy hours and deals on in the various estabishments. It's only a 5-10 min stroll to Boat Quay for even more bars and restaurants, and one of my favourite views of Singapore on an evening.
Slight downside to this stay was that part of the hotel exterior was covered with bamboo scaffolding as they were repainting; it was unsightly but not a big problem.

Date of stay: May 2011,jpwilli,Don't trust the photos,Booked this hotel online as it was one we had always wanted to try in Singapore. Only had a 2 night stay so selected the 'Classic Room' at overA$200 p/night as the image looked great in the Agoda site and others. Checked in to find that they could only provide a twin bedded room and no other was available. Room was very average. Old style furnishings nothing like the photo. Complained and were told the hotel was fully booked. The manager sent up a bottle of wine but sadly this did not address the lack of amenity. The staff were very friendly but no amount of good location made up for a bad room. Management should also mention there are extensive renovations in the hotel - maybe why no rooms available.

We didn't have meals in the hotel but we did have drinks one night in the outdoor area near the hotel and this was conveniently charged back to our room.

It wasn't noisy in the hotel though - infact the comfort was top notch. We paid extra for a Swiss Business Executive room which entitled you to breakfast and evening drinks and snacks (6 - 8 pm) and as drinks are very expensive in Singapore  - I think we got our moneys worth! The staff are lovely in the executive lounge and the food is excellent - you could almost do without having an evening meal after this - there were sweet and savoury snacks and some people were obviously making a meal of it. The views are lovely too. All you have to remember really is that Singapore hotels always add a hotel tax onto your bill so don't forget to take that into account. Our room was enormous and had a coffee maker and everything else we needed. The executive lounge has wi-fi. Oh and even when you have checked out there is a room on the first floor where you can take a shower if your flight is later in the day - believe me you will need it as 30 seconds in the singapore humidity will make you long for shower again. Marvellous city though. We loved the beach area at Sentosa - you can get the nearby metro but there were 4 of us so taxis were dirt cheap to use.,Trip type: Travelled with friends,"Whitby, United Kingdom",4375 ,501 ,,5.0
Date of stay: July 2010,Kate013,Resort Style in the Best Location,"The Swissotel is in the best location, sitting just a minute or 2 walk over to the bars,restaurants and nightlife of Clarke Quay. The Clarke Quay MRT train station entrance is located at the back of the hotel making it very quick,easy & cheap to get to anywhere in Singapore for around $2.00 SGD. China Town is also very close - just 2 stops away or a 10minute walk. Universal Studios down in Sentose is approx 10minutes away in cab that only costs about $7.00 SGD in a cab.

The hotel itself is very nice and has a great pool area with a water slide for kids and a wading pool for younger kids. There is also a restaurant/bar in the pool area that serves snacks and yummy cocktails by the pool. They are a little pricey but alcohol in Singapore is expensive.

The breakfast at the cafe that looks over the river is great! It serves all of the normal buffet breakfast food - both Western and Asian choices - very much worth paying the extra for!

Our room was a good size with a nice view over the pool, although our Air Con was making a loud buzzing noise the first night but was fixed straight away when we told the front desk in the morning!

Another thing - the buffet breakfast, which at 30 SGD per person wasn't cheap, but an amazing selection, and you could fill up to your heart's content, so that you wouldn't need breakfast - handy for those taking all-day tours. I would definitely stay here again..",,"Doha, Qatar",94 ,98 ,5.0,

The location is ideal for the mrt and Clarke quay area of Singapore with loads of places to eat and drink, with NO noise at night! Perfect.
Classic rooms are quite old fashioned so if you want a modern one go for the next room level up. The room was big and bathroom nice though.
The maid service is excellent and all the staff around the hotel are very friendly.
Room service is fantastic ‚Äì hot and tasty ‚Äì and they even call you afterwards to ask if the food was good ‚Äì this is a first for us throughout a 3 month trip in asia!
There is a laundret by the gym ‚Äì costs $8 per load and they have a washer and a dryer ($8 each).
Negatives:
The pool area is quite crampt with sunloungers.
The main negative is the Blue Potato Restaurant which is supposed to be fantastic. It wasn‚Äôt. We got served very old wine for a huge price $14 for a TINY glass of white wine and really poor staff (quite rude actually) so we left and got room service. Same food ‚Äìdelicious ‚Äì but you can buy your own drinks and get fantastic staff serving the food into your room. Excellent.
Transport/Tips:
From the airport you need to change a couple of stops from the airport (Everyone will get off there!) and again at Outram Park to get to Clarke Quay station. To get out of the station head to Central (shopping mall) and up the escalators into the mall, past subway and the hotel is directly opposite the mall on the other side of the road. Note the mall shuts at 10pm just take another exit. No problem.

For the price, I want to expect luxury - but this is not a luxury hotel.My company paid for a basic room with 2 full-sized beds.  With just me in the room, it was plenty spacious, and had a nice view of the courtyard and pool.  The beds are very hard, but pillows and blankets comfortable.  The bathroom was large with every amenity I look for (slippers, toiletries, hairdryer, etc) EXCEPT a robe.  This seems a strange omission.  Wireless and wired internet is available for an incredible $12SGD an hour or $28SGD a day.  Breakfast is NOT included in the basic room, and runs $30SGD + 10% gratuity + tax, if you eat in the hotel.  For the price - get an upgraded room that includes internet and breakfast, if you plan to need them.My interactions with hotel staff were limited, but I found them generally friendly and helpful.  Expect slow service in the restaurants when it is busy, particularly on drink refills.  The breakfast buffet has many good foods, although the selection is the same each day.  The lunch buffet is a better experience, with many more stations and a very good representative sampling of local cuisine - our local contacts actually brought us to our own hotel for lunch, as they enjoyed it so much.  Don't feel confined to the hotel for food though - Clark Quay has many, many good restaurants along the river.  You can also go to the basement level of the nearby mall for cheap local food - $4SGD for a prawn noodle bowl lunch for example.If you are visiting Singapore on business, this is an excellent location.  If you are here primarily to shop, you will want a hotel closer to Orchard road.  Either way, taxis are abundent and not expensive, and it seems to take no more than 30 minutes to travel.

THE GOOD:

Strategic location. Located at the touristy and contrived (but not bad) Singapore River walk with their 10-15 Sg $ beers. Clarke Quay MRT Station is just beside and under the hotel. Cabs are within the thoroughfares. 5-10 mins (during rush hour) away from Chinatown, Raffles City, Bugis and the Esplanade where we watched the NY Philharmonic. There is also an HSBC ATM just outside the hotel along the Riverwalk. Everyone and the cabbies in town knows where the hotel is.

Room Service is excellente! Was very very very tired one night to grab a late night grub and decided to call room service instead. Since its a 5 star hotel, it doesn't come cheap (and not w/in the test of reasonableness maybe), but the seafood fried rice was one of the best damn thing I ever had in recent memory. The meal and service was also quick, served in generous portions and fresh. (Well, it has to be if you are paying 20 bucks)

The hotel staff learned that I will be spending my birthday while I'm checked in so they sent me a birthday cake. A chocolate mousse. Other than the thought, it was classy and delicious too. My room was also upgraded.

Rooms were well-appointed, comfy king sized bed, pillow and sheets. It was small but the interiors were tastefully intelligent with modern designs. There were free issues of Time and Newsweek magazines as well as other Sg periodicals.

Wifi is free at the lobby and lounge area. They also offered me to use the pool showers after I check-out since my flight would be later on the early evening of the day I check-out.

High marks also for cleanliness.

Warm and accommodating staff at the reception, the cafe and housekeeping during our stay.

THE (not gruesomely BAD) but qualifies as BAD:

The hotel building was itself dated. Although there were constant renovations to catch up with the times, not all of the facilities were spruced up. The bathroom and the tub were still on old tiles, its no big deal though since they were clean at all times. Water pressure was also 'in the middle'.

THE UGLY:
Buffet breakfast was so so :(
Was looking forward for the buffet spread and Swissotel standards to start one hectic appointment-ridden day. Although the staff were completely attending to you're needs, the buffet spread was less colorful and interesting. Restaurant interiors were dim and dull, not the kind of atmosphere to start a hectic day for business. Only one kind of sausage, simple potato spreads, egg station, cereals and less variety of fruits. Pastries and Asian fares were also limited. Can't help to compare it with other 5 star breakfast spreads at the Hyatt, Fullerton, Mandarin, even Novotel. It was not worth the SG$ 30 per person tab. Also heard that nearby Swiss Stamford is well known for its food. You hearing that Swiss Merchant Court :)",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Taguig City, Philippines",117 ,22 ,4.0,
Date of stay: October 2009,Sue L,"Convenient location, good standard of accomodation","We stayed at the Swissotel, Merchants Court in October 09. The room was clean, well presented and spacious. The back of the hotel opens onto the river at Clarke Quay which has lots of bars and restaurants; and is where you catch the Hippo river tours. The hotel is near a couple of malls and is close to Clarke Quay Metro, China Town is a 5 to 10 minute walk away. There is wifi in your room, but this costs S$20 per day. You can however walk to the local Subway, McDonalds or Starbucks with your laptop and get free wifi (less than a 5 minute walk away).
For a cheaper alternative to the hotel breakfasts you can walk to the cafes at the nearby malls where you get a choice of local or international food outlets.
The pool was small, but very nice with good loungers and a bar service. Unfortunately the pool area goes into shadow mid afternoon. A gym is located next to the pool.
The reception staff were polite and helpful. We left luggage at the hotel while we went travelling and there was no charge for this service.

There is a Kopitiam in the shopping centre next door which is really reasonably priced, about $4 for a meal, and their food and juices are really good, and the its also really clean.  the Kopitiam is on the top floor and has windows all on one side overlooking the river so it's a really nice place to have breakfast or any meal really.  the Hotel pool is really extremely nice, and has a small water slide which is fun!  It also looks over the river and has a spa as well.  when we arrived it was about 6.30 /7 am and the check in staff were very pleasant and said that they would make a room ready for us by 9am, which they did.  we also asked if we could have a room with a nice view which they very nicely changed for us, and we got an extremely pleasant view of the pool and the river and restaurants below, for the same price.

Service-wise the reception desk is alright and getting the key was no difficulty. But later when I checked in I realized the room was a 2-bed room instead of a 1-bed room, the one I requested. I understand that in busy days these requests might not be met, but can you tell me while I get my key? Later I phoned down they said well all the king rooms are booked and there's no guarantee that I could get one next day.

I've been to many hotels in my lifetime this is one of the few world-class hotels that you cannot specify which bed you want. Yes the reservation did tell me the room is subject to availability, but I do think many want to know in advance whether the room requested is available (whether it's the bed type, or smoking/non-smoking). The next day I did get to switch to a king-bed room, which I had to phone and re-ask for it.

As for the hotel.. i consider myself a well travelled person, and have stayed in many hotels across the world!

The hotel facade is good, and they are tidying the outside up, as we noticed them cutting down the palm trees at the front of the hotel. The inside lobby area is well presented, but a tad dark, and the bar/piano area was very open! i didnt like that but, thats my opinion. the room as i said, was small, it was a business exec.. not really anything exec about it. The carpets on the 3rd floor are well worn, and the decor needs a bit of a spruce!

We didnt eat in the hotel, as it felt a bit'stark' and there are many places to eat over the bridge at Clarke quay(the tent was great place to eat, serving a mongolian buffet, try it..)

The hotel is brilliantly situated, and i would imagine if you get a room over looking the river, with a nice view..even better!!

The staff at the front desk were polite at all times, so no faults there, and yes it was clean! I think that over all i will stay there again, but will take a late booking, and see what we are given, as the room for me was very diapponting!

I was half-expecting some unforeseen hitches because of some of the traveler reviews here on Tripadvisor, but there were no problems at all. Check-in was pretty quick, but that may be because we arrived around midnight.

Our room was not large but by no means cramped; the layout is very sensible and the ceilings high enough that claustrophobia wasn't an issue. As expected (I had asked reservations about this during booking) we had no view whatsoever -- our room was facing construction. This is perhaps why we got a good rate.

The bathroom was very nice, quite spacious. Room A/C, lighting, and cable TV were good as well. Internet connectivity was availiable but I didn't use it on this trip.

Staff were very friendly and helpful, in all areas. Housekeeping was very responsive to our requests, and the concierge lent us a couple of Swissotel umbrellas to help us brave the tropical downpour that came one day.

Room service was prompt, the food very good and the prices not too exorbitant (I had an *excellent* cheeseburger here -- I know, I know, I should be sticking to great Singaporean food, but for a midnight snack it was terrific.)

Location is EXCELLENT, especially if you're in Singapore to party and eat. Great places nearby (Clarke Quay is right behind the hotel!) and two convenience stores are just seconds away from the hotel in case you need some supplies in a jiff.

My point is, why offer the option then?  I check-in very late in the evening and was given an option of either non-smoking room with 2 single bed or smoking room with king size bed.  I opted for the king sized beded room with hesitation. The one thing that really caught me by surprised was the missing complementary drinking water in bottles.  I thought the house keeping may have forgotten.  The receptionist said there is no complementary drinking water for the rate I paid.  I responded with sincerity that this is the first time I stayed in a hotel in Singapore that didn't offer complementary drinking water.  The next category that has comp. water cost Sin30+++ more. I actually expected the receptionist to do a little more than stick to the books.  It seriously reflects rather badly of the brand as a whole for being money faced.  I mean, how much would it cost the hotel for  2 bottles of water?   it's my first time staying in a Swissotel but such experience is a real put off.The rooms are well kept despite it's age, location is great, decent toilettries but other than that, there is little to shout about.  Because the entrance floor is of tiles and gaps between the floor and door is about an inch, I was forced to be entertained by my neighbours happy endings. My conclusion, this place is money faced, lacks finesse in dealing with guests, perhaps as a result of the shortage of rooms in Singapore that brings out their Take it or leave it attitude.",Trip type: Travelled on business,"Singapore, Singapore",370 ,75 ,,3.0

We booked a double double room as we had our 10 & 11 yo with us. Now, this may be misscommunication with our travel agent, but I also did contact hotel prior who advised this room would be sufficient - it wasnt.

Upon arriving at check in ( we had booked and paid 6 months prior) they got our reservation wrong. Had us in a room with 2 singles - despite it clearly being wrtitten on all our documentation. They then claimed to 'upgrade' us. HA HA two double beds in a single room - with 2 towels, two cups etc etc. Had to get extras sent up. Guess what - bought 1 towel and one cup.... yes had to get another of each.

We contacted the staff and requested an addtional room/space. We made it quite clear we were willing to pay extra. My jusband said ""Now I'm not goping to have to chase you up every day about this?"" Not a peep out of them in the 4 days we were there. No call to say they were trying.

The rooms themselves are quite dated and smelt musty - it's time to replace the daggy bedspreads guys. Although the bathrooms are very nice. With two double beds, we got the joy of 1 bedside table.

The pool area is good for kids. Breakfast OK, althought poorly set up and constantly running into others. The service was average, particularly at checkin and check out. with the exception of the brilliant doorman who always went out of his way to help.

I am generally very easy going about hotels (see our recent Movenpick review) and generally roll with the punches on minor problems. I can honestly say our experience at this hotel really put a dampner on the end of our otherwise great holiday.

The others decided to stay there, but we told the staff that we just need a room with more space and no drying-process-machine next to your beds. And we were given a better room.

We started off with a bad start, as the check in was not aware that we were with 3 kids. I booked directly with them and got a confirmation via email for 2 rooms for 2 adults. Before we arrived I called reservations to change this into 2 adults and 3 children. Obviously this was not reflected in the paper work check-in had.
We could only add an extra bed for an extra charge, but I refused to pay for this as I had phoned them before. The check-in lady would not bend, and we had to go for 2 rooms with 2 seperate beds. In the kid's room we moved the 2 seperate beds next to each other, so they could sleep easily with 3 on it.

We did not take the breakfast as there were plenty of eating facilities close by.

Both rooms were on the tatty side and this hotel has obviously never heard of carpet cleaner as it was covered with dubious stains. Also stains on seats and hairs on the floors. They wouldn't even give me a free upgrade when my wife came over considering the money I had spent for the stay. Sorry won't be back, loads of better hotels in Singapore.",,,3 ,21 ,,2.0
Date of stay: March 2005,undies,wonderful hotel,"I stayed here with my two friends in March 2005. We loved the location of the hotel, the fantastic buffet breakfast, but most of all the outstanding pool. It was resort like and you didnt feel like you were in the middle of a city...This hotel is very handy to the MRT, restaurants etc etc.. I am a Travel Agent and I was very impressed with this hotel.. I will be highly recommending it to my clients ",,melbourne,15 ,25 ,5.0,
Date of stay: January 2005,Wanderer25757,Excellent - will definitely stay again.,"I stayed at this hotel in January 2005 from 7th through 12th.  I found everything exceed my expectations about the ambeince of the hotel starting from the entrance to the lobby to the reception, breakfast lounge, and of course the room.  I was allowed an early check-in and a late check-out.  The staff was extremely helpful with any questions including tourist related information and even lent me an umbrella free of charge on 2 days when it was raining heavily.  Of course, they did make me sign something saying that I would pay them IF I lost the umbrella which I think is very fair!  The most valuable thing for this hotel is its location - near the Clarke Quay - the night-life is excellent alongside the riverside - live music, lovlely restaurants with indoor and outdoor seatings,",,,2 ,29 ,5.0,

Right next to the metro, but then taxi's are cheap, so we prefered the ease of them instead. Chinatown is a short walk away and one of the better one's of any of the many capitol cities I have visited.  Highly recommended. ",,"Hove, England",5 ,92 ,5.0,

Reached the hotel at 3 in the night, but the belldesk person was very friendly and took all our heavy luggage to the  reception desk.   The reception staff was very friendly. The room was excellent. It was exactly how they show in their virtual tour. The room was well arranged and the bathroom was excellent full of ammenities.  The only thing i didn't like was the rather old water heater for making coffee. It had instructions only in japanese. But I guess its just a matter of minutes before you can figure it out.  The view was not that great as it faced a street. Also there was construction going on for building some mall. So quite noisy in the daytime.

The service and staff were greatly and friendly, the food was excellent. The MTR is close by (wasn't finished when last there).  Clarke key shops, food courts, restaurants and bars are just across the river.  Excellent hotel and fully recommend it to anyone staying in Singapore.

,Flyer33263,Merchant Court - BEST hotel in Singapore,"This is without exception a top class hotel and THE place to stay in Singapore.  It is beautifully laid out and the swimming pool is an oasis of colour and relaxation.  The whole place is most tastefully decorated and is a haven from the heat outside.  It overlooks the Singapore River and Colliers Quay.  A stroll across the bridge takes to you to bars, shops, restaurants and the famous Satay Club.  This trip to Singapore was a surprise for a 'landmark' Birthday and we stayed on the Executive Club floor.  The Merchant Court has the BEST Club Lounge ever.  The staff are fantastic and the amenities incredible.   A knock at the door on our second evening brought a beautiful Birthday Cake and Card from the Management.  It was a really nice touch.  I can recommend this Hotel to any",,,2 ,10 ,5.0,

NOT a 4 star hotel.   the staff are friendly. Breakfast is a zoo, but decent.  LOCATION is GREAT. next to Clark Quay. Overall, would not stay there again due to noise and the worn out room.

,Timothy C,Outdated rooms,My wife and I stayed for three nights in October 2004.The rooms reminded me of an old Holiday Inn. It looked like the owners renovated the outside recently for a more modern look. The exercise room and pool appear to be recently updated also. The new windows in our room on the executive floor were poorly installed with gaps around three sides. The location is great for tourists. Close to many restaurants and taverns. 15 minute walk to Chinatown. Only half a block to the subway. Everything considered I would try a different hotel if I was ever in Singapore again. ,,"Scranton, Pennsylvania",3 ,4 ,3.0,
,owlAnon,Food remains & dubious stains- not quite luxury,"Booked this hotel online as part of our return 2 night stopover from New Zealand. Rather fancied a bit of luxury after touring in a camper for two weeks. Arrived at check-in, jetlagged, only to be told that the king size, non-smoking room I'd definitely booked was not available and that we'd have to have a twin/smoking room! Felt instantly stressed (I'm asthmatic) and the guy at reception said he would upgrade us. After breathing a sigh of relief made our way to the room. Room had no balcony, rather worn carpet and nice-ish but rather worn chaise longue. Piece of carrot (room service remains?)  under the chaise and dubious stains on the bedside table (red wine?) and on the bedspread (yellow- didn't want to think about it too much). We contacted housekeeping and they cleaned the",,anon,93 ,143 ,3.0,
,nzsez,Fantastic Hotel - very impressed,Stayed here in October and it was fabulous. Being quite a particular person i was really impressed with the level of service and the cleanliness of this hotel.  (4- 5 star service at a 3 star price) I never really had to ask for anything as they always preempted my every need. Grace on concierge was most helpful and accomodating at all times. We stayed twice during the month and on the second visit were fortunate enough to get upgraded to a room with balcony and also given late checkout. (which was 6pm i might add!!!). Is on the MRT line but not far too walk to Raffles City and Chijmes (the bars and restaurants).  I would have no hesitation in staying there again. In fact i am planning to make a trip back next year too. Highly recommended. ,,"Auckland, New Zealand",1 ,10 ,5.0,

It is idealy located at Clarke Quay and nearby Harbour Quay which has a great selection of restaurants. A new MRT station has just opened on its doorstep from which you can travel to anywhere in Singapore, Orchard Road shopping in less than 5 min. We considered that the Hotel was good value, would recommend you go for a room on the Club Floor which provides a quality room that includes a great buffet breakfast and evening drinks which gives you an opportunity to meet other guests.  The hotel staff were excellent and they go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.   The swimming pool area was excellent to cool down in after a hard and hot day shopping.

Pool is a wonderful botanical setting with water slides for the kids and pool-side cabana bar for the adults. The staff (thanks to Eddie on Business Level!) does a superb job at meeting guests every need. Breakfast, unlimited cocktails and 2 pieces of laundry included make this a great deal.
